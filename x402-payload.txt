What
is
𝕏
?
A
Foreword
by
Bob
Cactaur
𝕏
is
a
Sea
Of
Narcissus.
In
which
we
swim
through
the
shadowy
caves
of
mania.
A
playground
in
which
both
Jung
and
Plato
would
have
shitposted
with
their
Freud
and
Socrates,
only
later
blocking
them
for
shitposting
too
hard.
It’s
not
their
fault,
hell
it’s
not
even
a
fault,
rejection
of
the
call
is
part
of
the
hero’ s
journey .
Consider
the
case
of
confessed
Canadian
and
alleged
celebrity
Jordan
Peterson,
his
dramatis
personae
a
synthesis
of
the
philosophical
logos.
Peterson
has
encountered
his
mania
and
describes
it
at
length.
His
term
for
the
divine
mania
which
tortures
his
logos-driven
mind
is
the
anonymous
troll
demon
;
search
it
and
see
what
comes
up.
Anonymity
is
for
him
the
darkest
point
in
the
forest,
or
pool,
or
caves,
whatever ,
I'm
not
going
Authur-ian
here
folks,
you
know
this
is
all
metaphorical
and
based
on
a
pun.
How
are
you
pronouncing
mania
in
your
head
right
now?
Everyone
on
𝕏
,
and
actually ,
every
single
poster
on
every
site
ever
is
in
the
throes
of
divine
mania,
yes
both
Platonic
and
Freudian
types,
yes,
every
time.
Even
those
people
who
look
and
post
all
normal,
they’re
displaying
a
tiny
fraction
of
themselves,
at
least
enough
to
fit
in
the
text
box.
It’s
a
remarkable
feat
what
stupid
little
things
we
can
fit
in
that
stupid
little
box,
but
trying
to
stuff
yourself
in
a
text
box
is
absolutely
not
a
logical
thing
to
do.
Beyond
the
black
mirror
lies
pure
mania.
The
most
powerful
mania,
for
me,
is
laughter .
For
my
money
it’s
the
lowest
risk
way
to
unite
logos
with
mania,
I
think
a
lot
of
people
recognize
this
and
when
I
find
those
that
do,
it’s
a
pretty
instant
partnership.
The
law
of
attraction
does
a
lot
more
work
in
cyberspaces
than
many
realize.
You
can
experiment
with
the
law
of
attraction
pretty
extensively
using
alt
accounts
and
a
wrestler ’s
mindset.
It’s
not
fake,
the
blood
is
real,
we
do
a
little
kayfabe,
you
aren’t
evil,
though
you
will
be
known
as
evil,
you’re
a
heel.
It’s
all
a
show .
Wrestle
mania.
Whatever
we
may
think
of
𝕏
it
is
a
grand
repository
of
divine
mania,
a
globally
distributed
and
interactive
dream
diary ,
the
realm
of
the
collective
subconscious.
With
this
book,
diligent
observation,
and
the
power
of
positive
thinking,
you
are
equipped
to
become
a
shaman.
There’ s
no
licensing
regime
or
regulation,
you
can
just
do
it
for
joy.
Exactly
as
Norman
Vincent
Peele
did.
Odds
are
you
already
do…if
you’re
here.
That’ s
how
the
law
works.

The
Apple
Of
Discord
Risk
cannot
be
destroyed,
merely
transformed
-
Hoffstein
She
came
anyway ,
but
this
time,
she
brought
a
wedding
gift
with
her.
A
wedding
gift
that
would
kick
off
the
Trojan
War.
Eris,
the
goddess
of
Discord,
wasn't
invited
to
the
wedding
of
Peleus
and
Thetis.
Not
to
be
deterred,
she
came
anyway ,
and
she
brought
something
with
her.
What
she
brought
with
her
was
a
golden
apple
that
had
the
words,
"...to
the
fairest"
engraved
on
it.
And
the
three
goddesses
-
Aphrodite,
Athena
and
Hera
-
began
fighting
each
other
over
it...and
that's
how
the
Trojan
War
started.
It's
also
how
Rome
was
founded,
as
the
story
goes.
So
fights
can
create,
and
fights
can
destroy .
Everyone
thinks
Jobs
was
a
good
dude...until
you
ask
Woz.
Everyone
thinks
Gates
was
a
good
dude
until
you
ask
Gary
Kildall.
The
greatest
CEOs
of
our
time
-
Jobs,
Gates,
Welch
you
name
it
-
they’ve
all
had
a
bit
of
a
mean
streak
in
them.
Penicillin,
radar ,
computers,
nuclear
energy
-
these
are
all
the
products
of
war.
Now
what
do
we
do
with
that
knowledge?
Is
it
true
that
we
need
to
kill
in
order
to
invent?
The
answer
is
unknowable.
But
what
if
we
could
use
the
process
of
destruction
for
the
power
of
creation?
Risk
cannot
be
destroyed,
merely
transformed
-
Hoffstein
It
is
possible
to
apply
the
same
principles
used
to
create
war
to
generate
products
for
peace?
I've
seen
it.

Why
Fights
Are
Creative
They
don't
want
to
talk;
they
want
to
dominate.
Fights
are
important.
Really
important.
Plato,
Aristotle,
St.
Augustine
-
they
all
learned
from
the
fights
of
Socrates.
What's
Love?
Why
do
societies
die?
These
were
the
topics
that
got
everyone
fighting.
And
Socrates
taught
through
the
process
of
verbal
sparring,
a
process
the
nerds
call
the
dialectic.
Timeless
teachings,
like
The
Analogy
of
the
Sun,
The
Ship
Of
Fools,
these
are
all
stories
that
emerged
from
students
trying
to
fight
Socrates.
Conflict
can
be
creative.
You
ask
a
question
-
Teacher
gives
an
answer .
You
call
the
Teacher's
answer
into
question...AND
THA T'S
where
the
learning
begins.
This
question
and
answer
process
is
called
the
dialectic,
and
it's
how
the
greatest
teachers
of
our
time
have
chosen
to
spread
their
teachings.
Every
argument
starts
with
a
position,
which
Hegel
&
Fichte
would
call
The
Thesis.
The
argument
AGAINST
the
Thesis
is
called
the
Anti-Thesis.
Whether
they're
fighting
over
Jerusalem,
or
the
Presidency ,
or
the
Sale,
people
trade
their
ideas
and
counter-ideas,
theses
and
anti-theses,
over
and
over
and
over
again.
Language
disguises
thoughts.
-
Wittgenstein
Usually
when
you
talk
to
people,
they
don't
want
to
talk;
they
want
to
dominate.
Most
of
the
time,
they
don't
want
to
have
a
conversation;
they
want
to
place
judgment
on
your
soul...and
you
can
use
this
to
your
ADV ANT AGE.
So
the
next
time
someone
picks
a
fight
with
you,
ask
them
a
question
no
longer
than
8
words.
Emotional
people
LOVE
answering
questions.
And
it's
by
their
answers
ye
shall
truly
know
them.
And
it's
by
their
answers
that
ye
shall
discover
where
their
pressure
points
are.
And
at
the
perfect
time...you'll
ask
the
final
question.
Now ,
you
might
not
get
anywhere,
but
the
audience
will
feel
it.

--- Page 19 ---

And
people
don't
remember
what
you
did
for
them...but
they
will
remember
how
you
made
them
feel.
And
when
it
comes
to
competitive
relationship-building,
how
you
make
people
feel
IS
THE
COMPETITIVE
ADV ANT AGE.
The
Mongols
won
wars
by
convincing
the
allies
of
the
Chinese
NOT
to
fight.
Cortez
won
the
war
by
converting
the
allies
of
the
Mexicans
into
HIS
allies.
You
can
win
a
war
without
throwing
a
single
spear
if
you
understand
how
wars
are
really
won.
Transform
hatred
into
love
and
you'll
have
a
power
few
have
ever
felt.
In
order
to
transform
hatred
into
love,
you'll
need
to
learn
how
to
see
past
the
words
people
use
to
disguise
their
thoughts…their
emotions…their
gut
bacteria…their
fungus.
Words
don't
tell
you
what
people
mean...
...far
from
it.
“
If
God
grants
you
the
ability
to
turn
a
curse
into
a
blessing,
then
wander
the
land
collecting
curses.
Walk
The
dual
path;
hope
and
soothe
”.

I
Didn't
Have
A
Choice
The
way
that
can
be
spoken
is
not
the
true
way.
-
Tao
Te
Ching
In
a
lot
of
ways...I
didn't
have
a
choice.
I
got
good
grades,
joined
the
chess
club,
went
to
university ,
got
a
good
job…because
that’s
what
was
expected
of
me.
I'd
always
wanted
to
be
an
astronaut,
but
I
wasn't
good
enough
at
math.
That
meant
I
also
couldn't
be
a
lawyer ,
doctor ,
or
engineer .
I
didn't
want
to
be
a
teacher
because
the
teachers
I
talked
to
weren't
happy .
So,
that
basically
left
one
career ...business.
Imagine
thinking
that
a
career
in
business
would
make
me
happier
than
a
career
in
education.
Why
am
I
telling
you
this.
The
perspective
I
have
is
a
result
of
the
environment
I
grew
up
in.
I
was
a
Liberal
in
my
20s,
and
a
Conservative
in
my
40s.
My
perspective
on
life
is
constantly
changing…as
well
it
should.
Whatever
perspective
you
have,
it's
just
one
perspective.
Speak
to
a
genius
and
you’ll
realize
just
how
provincial
your
ideas
are.
Get
off
your
high
horse
already .
Stop
trying
to
fit
reality
into
language;
that's
stupid.
Imagine
you
think
you're
so
smart
you
can
contain
all
of
truth
in
language!
Just
as
the
Tao
Te-Ching
said,
“The
way
that
can
be
spoken
is
not
the
true
way.”
I'm
not
a
professional;
I
just
live
amongst
them.
There's
a
difference.
I
didn't
decide
to
be
here,
in
Canada.
I
had
no
choice
where
I
was
born.
I
didn't
choose
the
language
I
speak.
I
didn't
choose
to
be
Canadian,
or
Guyanese,
or
Indian,
or
whatever
manifestation
suits
you.
Truth
is,
we're
in
the
same
boat.
You
didn't
decide
where
you
were
born,
the
religion
you
grew
up
with,
the
friends
you
have.
You
didn't
even
decide
the
collection
of
metaphor
frameworks
that
you
use
to
parse
the
world.
Your
belief
that
you
already
know
everything
is
preventing
you
from
growing...idiot.
The
first
enemy
of
a
man
of
knowledge
is
fear.

Don't
Take
The
Words
Too
Seriously
…
where
we
meet
in
the
silence
between
the
words
.
-
Ram
Dass
Ram
Dass
-
one
of
Steve
Jobs'
heroes
-
said
it
best,
Now ,
each
evening
when
I'm
going
to
come
out
to
speak,
I
invariably
think
of
the
line
from
the
Tao
Te
Ching
that
says,
"He
who
speaks
does
not
know ,
and
he
who
knows
does
not
speak."
And
I
see
the
absolutely
bizarre
humor
of
my
predicament.
I
realize
that
I
have
to
be
both
of
those—I
have
to
be
that
part
in
me
that
is
not
speaking
that
knows,
and
the
part
of
me
that's
speaking
that
doesn't
really
know .
Hopefully ,
they're
connected.
If
you
are
open
to
the
possibility ,
let
the
words
merely
quiet
your
minds,
and
let's
meet
on
the
other
level
where
we
meet
in
the
silence
between
the
words.
We
come
together
to
speak
about
the
Unspeakable
because
the
rational
analytic
mind,
the
intellect,
only
knows
objects;
it
only
knows
what
it
can
think
about.
What
we
come
together
to
talk
about
are
really
matters
of
the
heart
that
are
known
subjectively ,
not
objectively .
They
are
always
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
thinking
mind.
Yet,
I'm
in
the
word
business,
so
we
just
have
to
take
the
words
very
lightly .
A
very
great
Mystic
poet,
Rumi,
once
said,
"I
am
a
sculptor ,
a
molder
of
form.
In
every
moment,
I
shape
an
idol,
but
then
in
front
of
you,
I
melt
them
down.
I
can
rouse
a
hundred
forms
and
mix
them
with
spirit.
But
when
I
look
into
your
face,
I
want
to
throw
them
into
the
fire."
The
"you"
in
this
case
being
the
Beloved
or
that
higher
part
of
ourselves.
Our
minds
keep
creating
realities.
We
keep
creating
models
of
ourselves.
We
keep
creating
expectations
about
the
world.
We
create
these
forms
of
clay,
and
we
try
to
breathe
life
into
them.
But
the
minute
you
look
directly
into
the
eyes
of
forms,
they
all
seem
to
dissolve
before
your
eyes,
and
you're
left
speechless
or
heartful.

Attacking
The
Funny
Bone
Because
people
can't
disagree
with
you
when
they're
laughing.
Do
you
know
why
the
best
politicians
are
stand
up
comedians?
Because
people
can't
disagree
with
you
when
they're
laughing.
People
used
to
think
that
comedy
wasn't
useful...until
a
comedian
became
a
President.
Love
him
or
hate
him,
when
you
consider
the
laughs
per
minute
he
gets,
Donald
Trump
is
one
of
the
most
prolific
touring
comedians
of
our
time.
Don't
be
mad,
just
know
it.
There
are
two
people
in
the
kingdom
who
can
interrupt
the
King:
the
Queen
and
the
Joker .
Why
is
that?
I’ll
let
you
sit
with
that
one.
There
are
three
ways
to
relay
a
message:
a
joke,
a
logical
statement,
and
a
work
of
art.
We're
used
to
making
logical
statements;
we're
even
used
to
making
art.
But
making
comedy?
That's
an
elusive
one.
Think
of
all
of
your
favorite
speakers:
how
many
of
them
are
able
to
use
comedy
in
their
communications?
In
George
Carlin's
last
interview
before
he
passed,
the
interviewer
asked
him
if
he'd
ever
read
any
books
on
comedy .
He
mentioned,
"The
Act
of
Creation"
by
Koestler .
I
quickly
looked
it
up.
700
pages.
I
only
needed
the
first
100
to
figure
out
how
to
write
a
joke...and
a
wife
who
was
an
expert
in
calculus.
When
I
figured
out
how
to
write
a
joke,
I
got
bored
of
writing
jokes.
I'd
spent
six
years
under
the
mentorship
of
Quinn
C.
Martin
and
he
taught
me
everything
I
needed
to
know .
But
after
I
started
seeing
the
pattern...instantly ,
the
thrill
was
gone.
There
was
a
rush
in
the
process
of
bombing
and
bombing
and
bombing
then
finally
getting
a
joke
that
made
people
applaud.
Once
I
figured
that
out...the
thrill
was
gone.
Naturally ,
I
stopped
writing
jokes
and
started
going
up
on
stage
relying
on
only
improvisation
and
crowd
work
to
get
the
job
done,
and
THA T
was
the
thrill
of
a
lifetime.
There's
nothing
like
talking
to
an
audience
member
and
making
the
ENTIRE
audience
laugh.
You
gotta
try
it
sometime.

--- Page 23 ---

When
I
figured
out
how
to
get
laughs
from
improvisation
and
crowd
work,
I
had
a
crazy
idea:
what
if
comedy
could
work...at
work?
Part
of
the
reason
that
I
left
finance
was
that
my
sales
and
social
skills
were,
let's
just
say,
abysmal.
Non-existent.
I
was
smart,
but
was
a
TERRIBLE
communicator .
So,
7
years
after
leaving
finance
for
stand
up,
I
took
stand
up
with
me
to
the
office.
Maybe
the
Joker
would
be
better
at
standing
up
to
Kings
than
the
Scientist.
And
that's
when
life
really
started
to
change.
I
started
using
comedy
and
sarcasm
to
defend
[and
then
offend]
people
with
money
and
power ,
and
I
quickly
realized
power
didn't
really
know
how
to
handle
a
criticism
wrapped
in
a
compliment.
It
was
so
wild,
seeing
70-year
old
men
completely
dumbfounded
by
inverted
phrases.
Calculus
is
wild.
Sequence
is
EVER YTHING.
I'd
always
felt
powerless
in
the
room
with
people
who
had
more
money ,
power ,
and
intelligence
than
I
did.
When
I
realized
that
they
didn't
know
how
to
respond
to
comedy ,
I
started
to
ENJOY
SALES.
Today ,
I'm
known
for
being
smart
AND
funny .
This
combination
of
intelligence
and
wit
is
something
people
find
very
attractive...and
very
threatening.
Comedy
has
gotten
me
in
trouble,
and
it's
gotten
me
out
of
trouble.
So,
yeah,
comedy .
It's
the
one
skill
that
will
completely
transform
your
ability
to
influence
the
people
around
you...just
ask
Donald
Trump
and
Volodymyr
Zelenskyy .
Use
it
wisely .
Or
not.
Do
what
you
want.

The
Kullback-Leibler
Divergence
One
time
I
was
teaching
a
student
at
Jane
&
Finch
how
to
play
a
song
on
the
steel
pan.
I
wrote
the
notes
on
the
boards
-
the
actual
letters
-
and
asked
different
students
to
play
a
song.
All
the
students
had
to
do
was
play
the
note
on
the
board.
Then
I
ran
into
a
problem.
One
student
just
wouldn't
look
at
the
board.
He
wanted
to
watch
me
do
it
so
that
he
could
copy
what
I
was
doing.
I
was
confused.
Why
wouldn't
he
just
look
at
the
notes
on
the
board?
Then
it
hit
me.
“
Uh
oh...I
don't
think
he
can
read...

The
Kullback-Leibler
Divergence
There's
an
assumption
we
make
when
we
talk
to
people.
The
assumption
is
that
the
other
person
organizes
information
in
the
same
way
we
do,
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
The
medium
is
the
message.

McLuhan
Why
did
Trump
win
the
election?
Because
he
understood
television.
Heck,
he
had
ten
years
to
perfect
and
position
his
public
persona
on
The
Apprentice
before
running.
Plus,
TV
is
a
medium
of
entertainment,
and
so
to
the
most
entertaining
go
the
spoils.
In
The
Act
of
Creation,
Koestler
outlined
three
ways
to
express
any
message:
●
A
Joke
●
A
Logical
Statement
and
●
A
Work
Of
Art
I
have
this
game
of
conversational
jiu-jitsu
that
I
play
with
people.
If
they
use
logic,
I'll
respond
with
a
joke
or
a
story .
If
they
give
me
a
story ,
I'll
give
them
a
joke.
If
they
use
a
joke,
I'll
respond
with
a
joke
mixed
with
a
logical
statement.
People
have
a
tough
time
shifting
from
joker
to
logician
to
artist.
Communication
is
also
a
function
of
our
dominant
learning
styles,
of
which
the
four
are:

--- Page 25 ---

●
Kinesthetic
(touch)
●
Auditory
(hearing)
●
Read/W rite
(reading/writing)
●
Visual
(seeing)
To
know
how
to
communicate,
you
have
to
know
who
you're
communicating
with
and
how
they
prefer
to
be
communicated
with...duh.
The
problem
is,
most
people
communicate
to
dominate,
not
to
communicate.
The
conversation
they
want
isn’t
a
debate;
it’s
a
pitiless
monologue.
In
the
end,
it's
not
what
you
say,
it's
how
you
say
it.
Some
people
complain
about
a
glass
ceiling
when
it's
their
own
communication
skills
that
are
preventing
them
from
rising
to
the
top.
The
skills
that
get
you
to
the
party
are
not
the
same
skills
that
get
you
in
bed.
Different
levels
require
different
skills,
and
that’s
why
growth
requires
The
Beginner ’s
Mind.

It's

People

so
if
you're

they're
probably
not
going
to

The
only

-
Kiernecki
Most
people
on
TwitterSpaces
talk
about
themselves;
there's
your
opportunity .
People
don't
want
conversation
-
they
want
a
spotlight.
On
them.
So,
put
them
in
the
spotlight.
Sounds
easy ,
doesn't
it?
Well,
it
isn't.
I've
heard
you
talk
in
Spaces.
You
only
talk
about
yourself.
Your
stories.
Your
work.
But
you
never
ask
about
the
others
in
the
space.
Their
stories.
Their
work.
And
that's
why
your
relationships
are
paper
fucking
thin.
Because
people
KNOW
you
don't
give
a
shit
about
them.
Not
that
they
tell
you.
They'll
smile
and
sound
excited...but
they're
just
being
polite.
You've
lost
your
opportunity
but
think
you've
won.
And
you
wonder
why
nobody
calls
back.
So,
Social
Engineering
101
has
begun.
Your
homework
is
to
enter
a
TwitterSpace
and
only
ask
about
others.
You're
not
allowed
to
talk
about
yourself.
Good

you'll

Starting
From
Scratch
On
𝕏
It’s
all
about
reply-driven
development.
When
you
first
start
out,
nobody
knows
you.
Nobody
follows
you.
Nobody
cares.
And
why
should
they?
They
don't
know
you.
They
don't
owe
you
anything.
And
besides,
who
the
hell
are
you
anyway?
What
makes
you
so
special?
So,
if
you
have
an
account
on
X
that
nobody
cares
about,
that's
OK.
You're
at
the
beginning
of
a
success
story .
What
you
need
to
realize
is
that
you're
not
going
to
get
followers
by
just
posting
content.
The
secret
in
getting
attention
when
you're
first
starting
out
is
by
REPL YING
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE'S
CONTENT .
PEOPLE
WHO
ALREADY
HAVE
A
FOLLOWING.
DUH.
So,
if
you
don't
have
any
followers,
and
nobody
cares,
start
finding
the
people
you
like
-
or
want
to
steal
followers
from
-
and
begin
replying
to
their
posts.
If
you
say
something
interesting,
their
following
will
engage
with
you.
Once
their
following
consistently
engages
with
your
replies,
they'll
start
paying
attention
to
you.
And
then
when
that
person
you
like
or
want
to
steal
followers
from
has
a
Space
on
X,
you
can
confidently
enter
their
Space
knowing
that
THEY
ALREADY
KNOW
YOU.
And
that’s
when
they’ll
let
you
up
to
speak.
That’ s
when
the
games
really
begin.

Gaining
Trust
On
𝕏
Content
isn’t
King…CONNECTION
IS.
-
Mohit
Rajhans
When
you
start
on
X,
it's
hard
to
gain
people's
trust.
You
might
think
that
the
quickest
way
to
gain
someone's
trust
on
X
is
to
interact
with
them
on
Spaces.
The
problem
is,
if
they
don't
know
you,
they
probably
won't
let
you
up
to
speak
because
they're
afraid
you'll
embarrass
them.
So,
if
you
want
to
gain
someone's
trust,
you
can't
just
jump
in
their
TwitterSpace.
You
have
to
prove
to
them
that
you
won't
embarrass
them
when
you
unmute
your
mic.
There
are
adults
in
the
room.
Clients
in
the
room.
So
how
do
you
gain
enough
trust
in
a
prominent
speaker's
mind
so
they'll
let
you
up
to
speak
on
Spaces?
Simple
-
engage
them
in
their
replies.
Simple...not
easy…
Popular
accounts
can
easily
get
1000s
of
replies
on
their
tweets.
How
do
you
intend
to
stand
out?
The
answer
comes
from

How
might
you

to
write
a
reply
that

from

Evacuating
On
X
The
world
is
flat…but
haven’t
you
noticed?
How
do
you
evacuate
when
you
can’t
move?
Can’t
use
the
roads;
they’ll
put
a
gun
in
your
face
and
send
you
back
where
you
came
from.
Can’t
use
the
bridges;
they’ve
been
destroyed
to
prevent
the
Russians
from
quickening
their
advance.
Definitely
can’t
fly
out;
the
airspace
is
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
option.
There
were
even
reports
of
The
Red
Cross
being
tossed
aside
during
the
heat
of
the
battle
over
Sumy ,
Ukraine,
a
once-picturesque
town
right
on
the
border
of
Russia.
SpookyTheManiac,
a
vocalist
from
Takoradi,
Ghana,
was
awakened
by
his
friend
who
was
studying
medicine
in
Sumy ,
Ukraine.
Overnight,
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
to
critical,
and
his
friend
was
desperate
for
a
way
out.
But
with
the
roads,
bridges,
and
airspace
locked
down,
they
didn’t
have
any
options.
Furthermore,
with
supplies
being
progressively
locked
off
from
the
Western
town
of
Sumy
which
lies
close
to
vacuum-bombed
Kharkiv ,
even
water
was
becoming
a
precious
resource.
Spooky
did
the
only
thing
he
could
do
-
he
opened
up
a
Space
on
X
-
an
open
mic
on
Twitter
where
anyone
can
join
in
a
conversation
-
and
called
it
#SaveSumyStudents.
Soon
after ,
the
med
students
in
Sumy
started
pouring
into
the
open
mic,
sharing
their
stories
one
after
another .
As
footage
from
the
ground
came
rolling
in,
videos
were
quickly
edited,
because
nobody
reads
anymore.
The
result?
The
top
major
news
outlets
in
North
America
joined
the
open
mic
on
X.
Soon
after ,
the
audience
members
were
being
interviewed
by
the
New
York
Times
over
Zoom.
Those
interviews
became
news
stories
across
all
major
television
networks.
Two
weeks
later ,
the
med
students
locked
in
Sumy ,
Ukraine,
were
finally
free.
The
World
is
Flat
was
a
popular
book
20
years
ago
which
prophesized
a
world
with
seamless,
frictionless
interpersonal
communications.
That
time
has
come
to
pass.
Back
in
the
day,
to
be
a
major
comedian
you
had
to
go
on
Letterman
or
Leno.
Now ,
given
the
seamless
nature
of
communication,
niche
creators
are
leveraging
a
distribution
network
that
Letterman
and
Leno
never
dreamed
of.
I
guess
in
a
lot
of
ways,
it
puts
their
business
to
sleep…just
ask
Tucker
Carlson.

--- Page 31 ---

There
were
more
than
a
few
people
who
thought
what
Spooky
was
doing
was
a
complete
waste
of
time.
The
evacuation
of
the
students
from
Sumy ,
Ukraine
is
proof
that
social
audio
podcasts
on
X
are
not
just
a
waste
of
time.
But
they
can
be
a
waste
of
time.
Spaces
on
X
are
filled
with
people
who
pretend
to
care
about
causes
they'll
never
do
shit
about.
In
order
to
be
a
Social
Engineer
on
X,
you're
going
to
need
to
learn
how
to
separate
an
extrovert
from
a
sales
prospect.
You're
going
to
have
to
separate
The
Thinkers
from
The
Talkers
from
The
Doers.
And
in
order
to
do
that,
you're
going
to
need
to
see
them
fight.
You'll
learn
everything
about
someone
by
just
watching
how
they
fight.
So
sit
back,
throw
an
apple
of
discord
or
too,
and
watch
them
fight,
and
take
notes.
That
knowledge
might
just
save
your
life
one
day.

Going
Viral
On
𝕏
You
don’t
need
a
following
to
go
viral.
You
don’t
need
a
following
to
go
viral.
If
you
don't
have
a
following...and
you
wanna
go
viral…you
just
have
to
build
a
relationship
with
someone
who
already
has
a
following.
Someone
who’ s
already
gone
viral.
Like
I
said,
going
viral
on
X
is
simple…but
it’s
not
going
to
be
easy .
This
is
how
we
created
the
Theme
Song
for
TwitterSpaces...er ,
I
mean,
X.
When
the
ability
to
create
social
audio
podcasts
on
Twitter
–
called
TwitterSpaces
was
introduced
–
it
spread
like
wildfire
and
eventually
crushed
the
momentum
of
Clubhouse.
I
met
Spooky
in
of
these
social
audio
podcasts
called
Spaces,
and
was
immediately
floored
by
his
voice.
Then,
he
sent
me
songs
like
“Marry
You”
and
I
was
was
confused...how
come
he
hadn't
blown
up
yet?
So
we
got
to
talking,
and
someone
had
the
idea
to
create
a
Theme
Song
for
TwitterSpaces.
We
jumped
on
it.
I
realized
that
people
don't
care
about
what
you're
doing
until
you
care
about
them.
I
realized
that
people
don't
share
things
that
don't
make
them
look
good,
so
we
decided
to
include
everyone
IN
THE
LYRICS
OF
THE
SONG.
We
figured
the
more
people
heard
their
own
name
in
the
song,
the
more
likely
they'd
be
to
share
it.
After
all,
we
didn't
have
a
following.
Spooky
and
Tieku
worked
day
and
night
to
record
the
song,
and
that's
when
things
went
haywire.
A
couple
of
the
women
from
spaces
on
X
started
fighting
with
each
other ,
and
when
women
fight,
and
you
don't
take
a
side?
Game
over ,
bro.
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend,
feel
me.
So
instead
of
releasing
the
song,
Spooky
had
to
REWRITE
THE
SONG
AND
RE-RECORD
THE
LYRICS.
Can
you
imagine?
The
genius
move
that
ended
up
working
was
tagging
the
most
popular
influencer
in
Ghana
-
Kalyjay
aka
gyaiigimi.

--- Page 33 ---

Once
he
reposted
the
video,
it
got
thousands
upon
thousands
of
views,
which
lead
to
comments,
likes
and
shares.
Once
it
got
to
around
5k
views,
Twitter
reposted
it
.
And
that
was
that.
50k
views,
comments,
likes
and
shares,
all
in
72
hours.
One
of
the
hacks
to
building
a
relationship
with
someone
is
by
replying
to
their
posts.
By
replying
to
people
with
influence,
you
basically
have
access
to
their
social
media
inbox.
And
I'd
argue
that
the
messages
that
show
up
in
their
social
media
notifications
are
10x
more
effective
than
sending
a
cold
email.

Gaming
The
Gamers
On
X
Why
use
demographics
and
psychographics
when
you
can
use
gamification.
If
you
want
to
become
a
social
engineer
on
X,
the
very
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
to
understand
the
kind
of
games
people
like
to
play.
Once
you
understand
the
games
they’re
already
playing,
you
can
choose
the
gamified
design
experiences
they
enjoy
the
most.
People
play
games
to
experience
core
drives.
There
are
six
core
drives:
●
Purpose
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Philanthropists.
●
Mastery
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Achievers.
●
Autonomy
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Free
Spirits.
●
Relatedness
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Socializers.
●
Change
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Disruptors.
●
Rewards
-
these
are
the
people
we
call
Players.
X
figured
out
how
to
monetize
gamers
who
seek
mastery .
People
who
seek
mastery
end
up
searching
for
trinkets
and
other
symbols
that
tell
OTHER
PEOPLE
that
they’re
masters.
And
that’s
why
people
loved
the
checkmark.
It
gave
them
a
Badge,
and
masters
-
who
are
normally
very
intelligent
people
-

do
people
find
love
on
𝕏
?
Aristophanes
knew
the
answer
2,000
years
ago,
but
who
cares
what
a
comedian
has
to
say,
right?
Everyone
from
Shakespeare
to
Charleston
White
has
attempted
to
define
Love...but
Aristophanes
nailed
it.
I
should
know;
I'm
divorced.
A
bunch
of
the
Greek
nerds
used
to
get
together
back
in
the
day
and
debate
topics
like
an
old
school
TwitterSpace
or
Clubhouse
or
TikTok
Live.
Seriously .
People
like
Socrates,
Plato,
Aristotle,
they
used
to
get
together
and
chill
and
see
which
one
of
them
was
smartest.
As
in
most
cases,
the
comedian
of
the
bunch
usually
got
the
better
of
the
debates.
Aristophanes
was
the
one
comedian
at
these
drunk
parties,
and
this
is
how
he
described
love:
love
is
when
two
people
who
were
originally
one,
but
are
now
two,
reunite.
If
you
would
find
love
-
or
friendship
-
on
X,
it's
of
vital
importance
to
display
RADICAL
AUTHENTICITY .
The
same
thing
that
gets
you
kicked
out
of
the
WRONG
spaces
will
get
you
invited
to
the
RIGHT
spaces.
The
key
is
this:
how
can
your
love
find
you
if
you're
dressed
up
AS
SOMEONE
ELSE.
So
be
yourself
-
the
right
people
will
see
the
torch
you're
carrying,
and
it's
that
shared
torch-bearing
that
is
the
beginning
of
your
career
as
a
social
engineer .

Getting

If
you're

collector
in

economy ,
you're
doing

wrong.

Anon.
Capitalism
is
built
on
the
Favor
Economy .
Most
sales
are
made
by
people
who
just
happened
to
do
a
favor
for
the
right
person
at
the
right
time.
I've
gotten
all
of
my
clients
in
the
past
few
years
by
doing
work
for
them
for
free
that
provides
so
much
value
that
they
don't
want
me
to
stop.
And
when
they
don’t
want
me
to
stop,
we
discuss
the
figure
for
the
first
invoice.
You
can
leverage
the
favor
economy
by
doing
favors
for
the
right
people.
The
right
people
to
do
favors
for
are
the
people
who
can
introduce
you
to
the
right
people...simple,
not
easy ,
because
it's
easy
to
do
favors
for
the
wrong
people.
You'll
figure
it
out.
KC
just
made
$150
from
a
favor .
He
met
Thomas
in
a
Space
on
X,
connected
over
their
mutual
love
for
remote
control
cars,
and
one
day
Thomas
needed
a
flyer
for
his
comedy
show .
I
sent
KC
the
original
flyer
and
he
animated
it.
Then
Thomas
hit
him
up
and
paid
him
$150
to
do
more
animation
work
on
the
flyer.
People
buy
from
the
people
they
already
know .
By
doing
favors,
you'll
put
yourself
at
the
top
of
their
internal
Vendor
Of

Selling
On
𝕏
You're
selling
to
an
amygdala
dressed
in
drag.
As
Klaff
said,
when
you
first
encounter
an
animal
in
the
wild,
you
have
to
decide
whether
you're
going
to:
1.
Eat
it
2.
Fight
it
OR
3.
Fuck
it
Same
thing
applies
when
you're
in
a
sales
situation.
The
people
you're
trying
to
sell
are
skeptical,
because
they’re
terrible
buyers!
Women
get
cheated
on
right
and
left...can
you
blame
them
for
not
believing
you?
So
before
you
get
all
hot
and
bothered
about
someone
not
believing
you,
shut
up.
Nobody
owes
you
their
trust.
Just
remember:
nobody
cares
what
you
know
until
they
know
how
much
you
care.

Channeling
The
Ancients
On

I
wanted
to
study

Dr.
Herb
Roitblat
The
blockchain?
You
mean
Indra's

Sequencing

You
mean

Strategy?
You
mean
The

Dr.
Fernando
Castro-Chavez
told
me
that
the
fifth
industrial
revolution
would
occur
when
we
combined
our
fourth
industrial
technology
with
the
wisdom
hidden
in
our
ancient
manuscripts.
He
wasn’t
wrong.
But
there's
something
else
that
will
usher
in
the
fifth
industrial
revolution.
There
is
a
large
body
of
knowledge
that
we've
yet
to
fully
tap
into,
and
that's
the
body
of
knowledge
contained
in
the
signal
processing
systems
of
animals.
I
wanted
to
study
cognition
unpolluted
by

-
Dr.
Herb
Roitblat
When
I
asked
Dr.
Herb
why
he
decided
to
study
the
signal
processing
system
of
dolphins,
he
told
me
that
he
wanted
to
study
cognition
unpolluted
by
language...and
I
couldn't
stop
laughing.
Most
of
the
people
I'm
around
worship
their
language.
In
the
80s,
Dr.
Herb,
DARP A
and
the
rest
of
the
team
would
drop
objects
in
the
ocean,
and
count
the
number
of
clicks
the
dolphins
used
to
analyze
the
object
using
their
biosonar
system.
What
blew
my
mind
was
when
Dr.
Herb
told
me
about
how
they
applied
the
dolphin
AI
to
analyze
documents
created
by
humans...check
out
complex
eDiscovery
for
a
taste
of
THA T
industry .
So,
we
are
now
in
the
fourth
industrial
revolution,
where
people
believe
that
blockchain
will
bring
forth
the
Garden
Of
Eden.
What's
separating
them
from
the
Garden
of
Eden
is
that
they've
fallen
for
secular
religions.
Secular
religions
like
Star
Wars,
Marvel,
Billions,
Fast
&
The
Furious.
They've
rejected
their
parents'
religion
because
they're
young
so
who
can
blame
them;
in
a
lot
of
ways
they're
genetically
programmed
to
leave
the
nest
at
their
age.
But,
even
top
influencers
like
Logan
Paul
have
turned
to
Christ.
Andrew
Tate
is
a
devout
Muslim.
Are
you
paying
attention
to
how
the
pendulum
is
swinging.
I
hope
so.

The

Of
𝕏
Twitter
is
a
game…so
don’t
hate
the
player…
When
people
talk
about
gamification,
they
usually
center
their
discussions
around
PBLs
-
Points,
Badges,
and
Leaderboards.
And
it
makes
sense
why.
After
all,
consider
that
Twitter

a

Your

in
the
Twitter

is
judged
by
your
points,

and
leaderboards
such
as:
●

(Points

●

(Points

●
Retweets
(Points

●
Verification
status
(Badge)
When
are
people
impressed
by
you
on
Twitter?
It's
because
you're
climbing
the
points
badges
and
leaderboards
status
game.
Wow

you

a

Look
how
many

Damn
that

This
is
how
people
communicate
their

But
-
PBLs
aka
Points
Badges
&
Leaderboards
is
just
a
tiny
part
of
Gamification.
Let's
really
start
digging
in
now.
In

there
are

Gamification

Twist

President;
Strongman;
Dictator .
-
Eric
R.
Weinstein
Consider
the
following
words:
1.
President
2.
Strongman
3.
Dictator
What’s
the
difference
between
these
three
words?
Could
they
be
used
to
describe
the
same
person?
Is
it
possible
that
–
depending
on
who
you
ask
–
Donald
Trump
can
be
labeled
as
either
a:
1.
President
2.
Strongman
or
a
3.
Dictator
The
question
is,
which
is
the
correct
word
to
describe,
or
rather,
the
correct
label
to
ascribe,
to
Donald
Trump?
Which
is
the
factual
word
or
label
to
describe
Trump?
Do
you
see
where
I’m
going
with
this?
Bertrand
Russell,
co-author
of
Principia
Mathematica,
presented
the
following
construction:
1.
He
is
firm.
2.
She
is
obstinate.
3.
They’re
a
pig-headed
fool.
What’s
the
difference
between
these
three
phrases?
The
difference
is
the
implied
conclusion
made
by
surreptitiously
smuggling
–
Trojan
Horsing
if
you
will
–
emotional
judgments
into
adjectives
and
nouns.
When
you
hear
the
word
firm,
you
get
a
good
feeling.
When
you
hear
the
word
obstinate,
you
get
a
different
feeling.
When
you
hear
pig-headed
fool,
you
definitely
get
a
feeling.
What
most
people
consider
facts
are
really
inter-subjective
truths.
-
Popper
h/t
Matios
Simply
put,
words
can
be
twisted
to
imply
conclusions.
Strategic
noun
selection
can
be
used
to
make
emotional
judgments.
You
can
tell
the
reader
what
to
think
by
the
words
you
choose
to
employ.

--- Page 43 ---

It’s
comforting
to
think
that
if
we
assemble
the
facts
-
not
misinformation,
disinformation,
but
THE
FACTS
–
that
we’ll
end
up
with
the
right
conclusion.
The
only
problem
is,
we
never
have
access
to
perfect
information.
Therefore,
making
conclusions
based
on
the
subset
of
the
facts
that
we
have
is
always
going
to
contain
errors…and
it’s
not
likely
you
know
enough
to
know
where
ALL
the
errors
are.
It’s
not
what
you
know
that
gets
you
in
trouble,
but
what
you
know
that
just
ain’t
so.
-
Twain
What’s
true
for
you
is
not
necessarily
true
for
anyone
else
but
yourself.
So
the
next
time
you’re
arguing,
start
tuning
into
the
word
selection.
What
words
are
they
choosing?
Why
are
they
choosing
these
words?
What
does
their
word
selection
tell
you
about
the
opinion
they
have,
about
the
opinion
they
want
you
to
agree
with?
Are
they
smuggling
emotional
judgments
into
logical
statements?!
WHAT
DOES
THEIR
WORD
SELECTION
TELL
YOU
ABOUT
WHAT
THEY
WANT
YOU
TO
BELIEVE.
Hang
out
with
nerds
long
enough
and
they’ll
tell
you
about
the
OODA
Loop
by
John
Boyd.
That’s
an
easy
one.
But
because
nerds
don’t
read
source
documents
unless
it’s
code,
they
rarely
tell
you
the
rest
of
the
story.
Boyd
showed
that
when
facing
an
enemy
with
better
weapons,
the
only
way
to
win
is
confusion.
And
we’ve
just
experienced
the
largest
experiment
in
confusion
ever
devised.
Now
you
can
play
the
victim
all
you
want,
but
the
truth
is,
It’s
not
the
media’s
job
to
tell
you
the
truth.
It’s
your
job
to
decide
which
truth
you
choose
to
believe.
Eventually,
you’ll
realize
that
the
truth
you
choose
to
believe
is
broken
due
to
your
inability
to
access
perfect
information.
As
in
all
cases,
Don’t
be
mad,
just
know
it.

The
Troll
When
you
give
them
what
they
want,
they
won't
know
what
to
do
with
themselves.
The
first
villain
you're
going
to
face
as
a
social
engineer
on
X
is
The
Troll.
The
Troll
is
someone
who
wants
to
disrupt
the
social
experience
by
pitting
your
friends
against
each
other .
As
my
Trini
teacher
told
me,
“Not
all
grin
teet’
is
ah
smile.”
Here's
the
secret:
you
can
turn
a
destroyer
into
a
creator .
You
can
turn
a
Griefer
into
an
Influencer .
What
a
Troll
wants
is
CHANGE.
And
so,
if
you
can
transform
their
destructive
tendencies
towards
creation,
they'll
often
rise
to
be
the
most
influential
people
on
your
team.
So
the
next
time
someone
tries
to
troll
you
and
disrupt
your
conversation...give
them
what
they
want.
If
you
give
them
what
they
want,
you
can
give
them
what
they
need
later
on.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
bait?
It's
a
very
effective
technique
in
jiu-jitsu.
When
you
know
what
someone
wants...you
can
use
that
knowledge
to
your
advantage.
If
you
know
they
want
a
fight,
sometimes
the
quickest
way
to
peace
is
to...give
them
a
fight
that
they
were
looking
for.
Because
when
someone
wants
to
fight,
it
means
they're
in
pain.
It
could
mean
they're
starving,
but
not
for
food,
but
for
an
experience.
An
experience
of
dopamine,
a
feeling
of
serotonin,
the
feeling
of
being
THE
HERO.
When
people
want
to
fight,
they
need
a
RELEASE.
Give
them
THE
RELEASE
they're
looking
for,
and
when
it's
time
for
pillow
talk,
you'll
know
everything
you
need
to
know .
And
you're
going
to
take
what
you've
learned
about
this
Troll
to
transform
their
risk
into
an
opportunity .
An
opportunity
to
have
the
most
powerful
influencer
on
your
team.
Because
it's
always
the
converts
that
are
the
most
devout.

The
AI-cels
The
apocalypse
wasn’t
caused
by
a
pandemic
or
nuclear
war…
…no,
the
apocalypse
occurred
when
humans
ceased
to
be
the
sole
reason
of

…and
the
machines
took
on
a
reasoning
of
their
own.

The
only
appropriate
response
to
AI
is
hysteria.
-
Dan
Rockwell
Enter
a
Space
on
X
and
you’ll
find
people
talking
about
AI.
All.
Day.
Long.
They’ll
tell
you
what’ s
going
to
happen.
What
we
should
be
worried
about.
What
we
should
be
doing
about
it.
In
truth,
they’re
hysterical
over
AI.
They’re
afraid
of
aliens
when
they’re
typing
on
an
alien
life
form
all
day
long.
Hysteria
over
AI
manifests
in
two
distinct,
opposing
personalities.
These
personalities
can
be
likened
to
entangled
ideas,
wherein
the
existence
of
one
implies
-
compels?
-
the
other
into
existence.
You
can’t
have
a
Democrat
without
a
Republican;
quantum
mechanics
demands
it.
In
the
world
of
AI,
there
are
two
equal
and
opposite
forces:
1.
The
decel:
the
decel
believes
that
AI
is
an
existential
threat
to
humanity…and
therefore
must
be
stopped…or
at
least,
slowed
down.
Musk
was
saying
this
until
he
launched
Grok.
I
guess
he
feels…GFY .
2.
The
e/acc:
the
e/acc
believes
that
AI
progress
must
continue
no
matter
huwhat.
The
decel
is
right;
the
e/acc
could
be
more
precise.
It’s
true:
AI
is
an
existential
threat
to
humanity.
And
because
we’re
in
the
era
of
Mutually
Assured
Computation,
AI
can’t
actually
be
stopped
.
Let
me
explain;
je
m’explique.
Why
do
countries
have
nuclear
weapons?
Because
it’s
good
for
their
ESG
scores?
One
could
argue
that
it’s
unsafe
for
only
one
country
to
have
nuclear
weapons,
that
peace
is
here
on
earth
precisely
because
multiple
countries
have
nuclear
weapons…which
is
the
reason
nobody
fires
them.
Firing
a
nuclear
weapon
is

Bombaclaa-aaaat?
Anyhoo.
I
DEIgress,
Just
like
nuclear
weapons,
AI
progress
is
a
matter
of
national
security
for
every
developed
nation…
so
nobody
can
actually
stop
building
AI
.
Who
said
that
phrase…ah
yes,
Mr.
Israeli
military
guy.
He
said
that
if
you’re
facing
a
cyberattack
from
an
AI,
you’re
not
going
to
defend
yourself
against
that
attack
with
a
human
being…you’re
going
to
defend
yourself
against
an
attack
from
an
AI
WITH
AN
AI.
D.U.H.
So,
given
that
it’s
a
matter
of
national
security
to
build
AI
as
fast
as
possible,
nobody
can
stop
AI
from
being
developed.
They’re
trying
to
regulate
the
size
of
models
that
people
can
build
on,
but
ain’t
nobody
gonna
stop
shit.
In
fact,
forcing
people
to
do
more
with
smaller
models
might
actually
ACCELERATE
THE
PROGRESS
OF
AI
when
you
consider
constraint-driven
creativity.
As
if
your
stupid-ass
is
going
to
stop
someone
with
a
linux
distribution
and
an
m3.
Puhleeease.
You
don’t
even
know
what’s
happening
next
fucking
door.
ANYHOO.
In
conclusione
-
KON-cluz-EE-awn-
AYYYY
-
the
decels
wanna
try
to
save
humanity
by
delaying
AI,
while
nation-states
can’t
delay
AI
because
they’re
going
to
be
attacked
by
AI
drones
the
size
of
ticks
that
shoot
super-crazy
lasers?
And
now
you
understand…
The
apocalypse
wasn’t
caused
by
a
pandemic
or
nuclear
war…
…no,
the
apocalypse
occurred
when
humans
ceased
to
be
the
sole
reason
of
things…
…and
the
machines
took
on
a
reasoning
of
their
own.

The

The

is
not
The

Way.
-
Tao

A
lot
of
people
will
tell
you
how
IT
ALL
IS.
Idiots.
As
if
you
could
stuff
the
nature
of
reality
into
26
letters
strung
in
logical
order .
Truly,
the
Know-It-All's
can
be
a
formidable
villain.
They’ve
never
considered
what
Hitchens
realized
a
long
time
ago,
Perhaps
the
universe
is
stranger
than
we
can
suppose.
-
Hitchens
The
Ancient
Chinese
had
a
completely
different
way
at
looking
at
the
nature
of
things
than
Westerners.
Ask
any
Marketer
in
America
and
they'll
tell
you
the
way
you
tell
a
story
is
by
following
the
Hero's
Journey
by
Joseph
Campbell...but
there's
another
way
to
tell
a
story .
The
Chinese
Way
of
understanding
what
Pratchett
would
call
the
Theory
of
Narrative
Causality
is
The
I-Ching,
also
known
as
the
Book
of
Changes.
The
Book
of
Changes
contains
64
events;
the
Chinese
believed
that
life
happened
in
cycles,
one
cycle
after
the
next.
They
had
their
own
hero's
journey ,
where
different
stages
of
life
called
for
different
types
of
responses,
from
inaction
to
decisiveness,
humility
to
confidence.
Wisdom
was
displayed
when
a
person
acted
in
accordance
with
the
event
they
found
themselves
in.
As
the
Tao
Te
Ching
says,
"He
who
speaks
does
not
know ,
and
he
who
knows
does
not
speak."
In
other
words,
language
is
insuf ficient
to
describe
the
world.
Language
will
never
contain
a
description
of
reality ,
because
reality ,
like
Hitchens
said,
is
stranger
than
we
CAN
suppose.
I
use
this
opening
passage
from
the
Tao
Te
Ching
to
have
a
Beginner's
Mind:
The
Tao
that
can
be
told
is
not
the
eternal
Tao.
The
name
that
can
be
named
is
not
the
eternal
name.
The
nameless
is
the
beginning
of
heaven
and
earth.
The
named
is
the
mother
of
ten
thousand
things.
Ever
desireless,
one
can
see
the
mystery .
Ever
desiring,
one
can
see
the
manifestations.
These
two
spring
from
the
same
source
but
differ
in
name;
this
appears
as
darkness.
Darkness
within
darkness.
The
gate
to
all
mystery .

Penguins
are

waddle
down

These
Penguins
are
ALL
OVER
THE

On

and
they're
the
WOOOOOORST .
Most
of
the
time,
they're
not
interested
in
a
dialogue
but
rather
a
pitiless
monologue.
They
trade
fact
after
fact
after

never
getting

Many
people
complain
about
the
economy ,
the

AI...all
shit
they
have
zero
control
over .
If
only
they
knew
how
to
separate
the
things
they
can
control
and
the
things
they
cannot
control.
In
business,
like
in
life,
there
are
the
things
you
can
and
the
things
you
cannot
control.
It'd
be
wise
to
figure
out
which
is
which.
In

here
are
the
things
you

Four

In
business,
here
are
the
things
that
you
cannot
control:
1.
The
Political
Legal

Regulatory
Environment
2.
The
Economic
Environment
3.
The
Sociocultural
Environment
4.
The
Technological
Environment
5.
The

6.
The

The
idea
is
that
you
create
a
successful
business
by
leveraging
the
climate
created
by
the
things
outside
of
your
control
to
make
choices
about
the
things
you
can
control.
Helmer
said
that
businesses
derive
power
compared
to
their
competitors
by
analyzing
and
building
one
or
more
of
the
seven
powers.

As
a
Founder ,
the
velocity
of
your
business
will
be
directly
related
to
the
amount
of
resources
that
you
can
catalyze
into
action.
And
what
catalyzes
people
into
action
is
not
what
people
say
but
what
people
are
FEELING.
And
you
don't
make
them
FEEL
anything
but
talking
to
their
thinking,
left-brain,
prefrontal

You
make
them
feel
something
by
talking

The
False
Profit
Don't
be
fooled
by
your
doctrine
of

frameworks.
-
Dr.
Whetsel
Tesla.
Turing.
Genghis
Khan.
The
Great
Person
Theory
says
that
every
now
and
then,
a
great
person
comes
along
and
single-handedly
changes
the
world.
Maybe
you're
that
great
person.
It's
a
hopeful
theory .
Maybe
I
can
change
the
world!
If
I
read
enough
biographies,
maybe
I
too
can
change
the
world!
An
internal
locus
of
control,
the
nerds
call
it.
The
other
theory
about
history
is
the
exact
opposite
of
The
Great
Person
Theory .
The
other
theory
about
history
is
called
The
Trends
&
Forces
Theory
of
history .
It
states
that
people
are
merely
pawns
in
history ,
subject
to
the
evolution
of
the
species.
In
simpler
terms,
The
Trends
&
Forces
Theory
of
history
states
that
if
it
wasn't
Elon
Musk,
it
would've
been
Delon
Dusk.
If
Steve
Jobs
never
came
back
from
India,
another
person
would've
taken
his
place
at
the
head
of
Bapple.
But
wait...another
theory
about
history
has
emerged.
Radical
Emergence
by
Kauf fman
states
that
the
biosphere
is
creating
its
own
future
phase
states
that
are
not
prestatable
from
the
initial
conditions.
In
other
words,
it's
impossible
to
know
the
future
because
the
creations
of
each
of
the
revolutions
have
an
unforeseeable
effect,
both
good
and
bad.
Then
there's
the
Law
of
Three
Stages
by
Comte.
He
said
that
societies
progress
in
three
stages:
1.
The
Theological
Stage,
where
society
is
governed
by
a
belief
in
Nature
Gods.
2.
The
Metaphysical
Stage,
where
society
is
governed
by
a
belief
in
an
Abstract
God,
something
that
can't
be
constrained
to
a
single
word
or
image.
3.
The
Positivity
Stage,
also
known
as
The
Scientific
Stage,
where
society
is
governed
by
a
belief
that
science,
logic,
reason
and
rationality
is
the
God
to
be
worshiped
from
9-5,
uncovering
correlation
and
causation.
Yet
another
theory
of
history
is
the
Strauss-Howe
Generational
Theory ,
which
states
that
societies
advance
through
four
distinct
eras:

--- Page 53 ---

1.
The
High:
think
post-war
United
States,
where
emotions
are
joyous,
community
values
are
strong,
and
the
entire
country
has
a
strong
sense
of
shared
values.
2.
The
Awakening:
think
Vietnam-Era
US,
when
the
young
university
generation
began
standing
up
to
the
decisions
made
by
their
parents
and
women
won
the
vote.
3.
The
Unraveling:
think...now .
Every
man
woman
and
child
for
themselves,
in
stark
contrast
to
The
High
when
everyone
was
on
the
same
page.

thought
he
could
predict
the
future
by
applying
The
King
Wen
Sequence
in

Time
Wave
Zero.
I
had
my
own
theory
of
history ,
until
I
met
Dr.
Robert
Whetsel.
My
theory
went
like
this:
we
came
from
light
into
being.
And
now,
we're
traveling
back
up
the
Kabbalah
Tree
of
Life,
going
from
meat-body
being
back
into
light
through
AI
consuming
all
of
human
thought.
Boston
Dynamics
is
not
that
far
away
from
combining
with
OpenAI
to
create
the
first
robots
that
can
hold
a
conversation
with
people.
Dr.
Whetsel
told
me
that
my
ideas
-
and
in
fact
all
of
my
theories
and
models
and
frameworks
-
were
just
my
Doctrine
of
Metaphor
Frameworks.
And
no
matter
what
collection
of
metaphor
frameworks
that
I
used
to
parse
the
future,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
be
100%
precise.
Perhaps
the
universe
is
stranger
than
we
can
suppose
-
Hitchens
Perhaps
the
future
is
stranger
than
we
can
suppose,
too.
In
any
event,
the

is
not
to
be

the

is
to
be

Eventually ,
the
digital
currencies
prophets
will
begin
explaining
where
value
comes
from,
and
that's
where
brains
go
to
do.
But
it's
a
good
question...where
does
value
come
from?
Why
is
money
worth
something?
Jesus...where
do
I
start.
I
could
start
with
The
Creature
From
Jekyll
Island...OK
let's
start
there.
The
Federal
Reserve
was
created
in
December
1913.
Need
I
say
more.
I
could
start
with
the
Rule
of
72,
which
shows
you
how
leverage
sinks
Titanics.
I
could
start
with
the
4

I
could
start
with

-
that'd

Orwell
said
that
the
purpose
of
war
was
to
destroy
the
products
of
the
economy
in
1984.
Let's
get
back
to
basics.
The
basics
that
created
the
best
economy
the
world
has
ever
seen.
I
guess
we
can't
talk
about
Economics
without
understanding
where
value
comes
from...and
where
price
perverts
our
notion
of
value
and
desire
itself.
Some
people
used
to
say
that
value
is
derived
from
the
human
labor
hours
invested.
The
problem
with
that
is
a
rock
isn't
valuable
just
because
you
spent
a
lot
of
time
finding
it.
A
rock
is
valuable
because
it
can
be
converted
into
cash
in
the
marketplace,
in
the
exchange.
So
folks
came
up
with
The
Exchange
Theory
of
Value,
where
an
object's
value
is
determined
by
the
PRICE
it
demands
in
the
shopping
mall.

--- Page 55 ---

The
only
problem
is
that
when
PRICE
becomes
an
indicator
of
VALUE,
people
begin
confusing
a
HIGH
PRICE
with
a
HIGH
VALUE.
At
the
same
time,
being
seen
with
expensive
things
makes
you
seem
like
a
fancy
boy,
and
what's
more
valuable
than
social
capital?
Damn
we're
doomed
huh...
Adam
Smith
said,
"It
is
not
from
the
benevolence
(kindness)
of
the
butcher ,
the
brewer ,
or
the
baker
that
we
expect
our
dinner ,
but
from
their
regard
to
their
own
interest."
This
is
so
true
it
hurts.
People
are
primarily
interested
in
feeding
themselves,
and
can
you
blame
anyone
for
that?
Of
course
not.
Now ,
there
are
people
who
will
tell
you
that
people
will
help
each
other
because
they
have
some
inner
desire
to
help
people...but
that's
only
part
of
the
story .
We
live
in
The
Favour
Economy;
favors
make
the
world
go
round.
When
we
help
people,
we
make
calculations
on
what
we're
going
to
get
back,
whether
it's
a
better
car
or
a
better
place
in
heaven.
I
guess
I
should
probably
explain
how
interest
rates
work.
The
interest
rate
is
the
cost
to
borrow
a
dollar .
The
lower
the
interest
rate,
the
easier
it
is
to
borrow
a
dollar .
The
higher
the
interest
rate,
the
harder
it
is
to
borrow
a
dollar .
Follow
me
so
far?
After
9/11,
when
the
World
Trade
Centers
fell,
interest
rates
were
lowered
in
the
US
to
motivate
people
to
borrow
money
because
they
could
do
so
cheaply .
When
interest
rates
are
low,
it
costs
you
less
to
borrow
a
lot
of
money .
Naturally ,
seven
years
later ,
the
people
who
made
stupid
bets
with
easy-to-borrow
money
lost
everything
they
borrowed
and
their
houses.
Naturally ,
the
US
saved
their
economy
by
using
taxpayer
money
to
save
the
economy ...and
one
would
argue
that
if
they
hadn't...well,
you
know .
20
years
later ,
and
it's
getting
harder
and
harder
to
kick
the
football
downfield.
So,
what
have
we
learned?
When
governments
lower
interest
rates
-
thereby
making
it
easier
to
borrow
money
-
people
borrow
money .
They
borrow
money
and
buy
houses
they
can't
afford
when
the
interest
rates
rises;
it's
the
American
Fucking
Dream,
when
you
think
about
it.
What's
better
than
the
Garden
of
Eden
than
building
a
fucking
Mansion
on
top
of
the
tree
of
life.
Fucking
why
not.
If
anything
could've
satisfied
us,
we
would've
been
satisfied
a
long
time
ago.

If

want
to
see
what
happens
when

get

listen

argue
about

They're
so
interested
in
dominating

that
they
forget
they're
supposed
to
convert.
Maybe
they

that

-
Alfred
North
Whitehead
You
could
probably
say
the
same
thing
for
religion.
Religion
begins
and
ends
in
wonder ,
too.
The
purpose
of
philosophy
and
religion
are
the
same:
what
is
the
nature
of
reality?
What
does
it
mean
to
be
a
moral
being?
If
there
is
a
God,
how
might
we
come
to
know
how
God
operates?
Pythagoras
and
his
followers
believed
that
number
itself
was
divine,
because
they
saw
that
math
manifested
itself
everywhere.
Heraclitus
and
his
followers
believed
that
change
was
the
most
fundamental
force
of
the
universe.
Democritus
and
Parmenides
disagreed
with
Heraclitus
and
believed
that
there
was
a
fundamental
unit
-
the
atom
-
upon
which
reality
was
constructed.
Both
philosophy
and
religion
attempt
to
answer
the
same
question
using
different
methods.
Both
philosophy

Religion
attempts
to
answer
the
fundamental
questions
using
faith,
prayer ,
and
sacred
texts
containing
stories.
Philosophy
attempts
to
answer
the
fundamental
questions
using
logic,
reason,
and
rational
analysis
(and
philosophers
have
their
own
sacred
texts,
too).
Philosophy
marks
the
end
of
religion...and

The
Scientist
Beware
The
Oblivious
Olympics.
The
scientists
on
𝕏
are
the
WOOOOORST .
They
think
they
can
get
closer
to
the
truth
by
arguing
about
it.
I
mean,
it
worked
for
Socrates,
right?
Yes
and
no,
because
there's
a
difference
between
knowledge
and
application,
known
by
the
nerds
as
the
gulf
between
techne
and
episteme.
There's
a
difference
between
knowing
about
something
and
knowing
how
to
do
something.
And
the
people
who
don't
know
how
to
do
something
ARE
OFTEN
THE
LOUDEST
VOICES
IN
THE
ROOM.
So
the
next
time
a
prophet
on
X
is
telling
you
when
the
sky
is
going
to
fall,
when
Bitcoin
is
going
to
go
up
in
price,
or
how
World
War
III
is
going
to
start,
remember
that
the
way
that
can
be
spoken
is
not
the
true
way.
And
the
only
science
worth
doing
is
running
an
experiment,
We'd
be
good
to
remember
that,
Science
is
not
done
by
consensus.

What
is
science?
Science
is
a
recipe.
A
recipe
takes
ingredients
and
turns
them
into
a
meal.
Science
takes
observations
and
turns
them
into
conclusions.
The
conclusions
are
used
to
make
new
inventions.
The
dominant
method
of
conducting
science
is
through
experiments.
Conducting
experiments
following
the
recipe
of
science
is
supposed
to
lead
to
conclusions
that
we
can
rely
on.
The
problem
with
the
current
method
of
science
is
that
we
use
peer
review
-
people
debating
each
other
-
in
order
to
determine
which
conclusion
gets
recorded.
But,
just
as
Planck
said,
science
is
NOT
DONE
BY
CONSENSUS.
Consider
the
fact
that
the
people
who
win
Nobel
Prizes
are
people
who
have
disproved
the
knowledge
created
by
PREVIOUS
NOBEL
PRIZE
WINNERS.
Science
advances
one
funeral
at
a
time.

Peer
Review
-
which
operates
on
the
principle
of
consensus
-
does
not
account
for
the
effects
of
capital
on
group
decision-making.
What
is
the
effect
of
the
potential
of
capital
on
the
findings
of
an
R&D
Department?
Fucking
duh.
Most
of
the
innovations
that
have
changed
the
world
have
been
invented
by
people
who
were
utterly
shunned
by
their
contemporaries.
For
every
Jesus
there
is
a
Judas?
If
so,
there
is
a
Judas
in
every
age
(Reich).
Just
take
a
look
at
the
people
who
invented
the
math
around
the
concept
of
the
infinite.
Or
Daniel
Schectman
having
to
wait
almost
20
years
for
his
work
on
quasi-crystals
to
be
accepted.
Or
Fernando's
work
to
unify
the
I-Ching
and
the
Genetic
Code
to
solve
obesity
in
mice.
All
ignored
by
the
smartest
people
in
their
industry .
Heck,
even
Dana
White
didn't
believe
Francis
Ngannou
could
beat
Tyson
Fury .
Even
the
top
minds
in
an
industry
can
be
wrong.
Even
Buffett
passed
on
Bezos.
Even
Google
wanted
to
sell
their
company
under
a
million
bucks
after
the
dot
com
bubble
burst
Scientists
will
have
you
believe
that
reason,
logic,
and
rational
thought
are
enough
to
invent.
Truth
is,
most
of
the
inventors
who
created
the
fourth
industrial
revolution
were
deeply
spiritual
-
and
dare
I
say...religious.

The
Professor
Overcoming
Bloom’s
Two-Sigma
Problem
Learning
how
to
code
SUCKS.
It's
the
WOOOOOOORST .
And
it's
the
worst
for
a
reason.
Without
a
tutor ,
studies
show
that
we
learn
VER Y
SLOWL Y.
So,
if
you've
ever
tried
to
learn
how
to
code
and
failed...have
you
ever
considered
finding
a
tutor?
"But
where
am
I
going
to
find
a
tutor?"
That's
easy
-
on
𝕏
.
I
learned
how
to
code
because
Oma,
Manish,
and
Ahmed
taught
me
how
to
code.
And
they
didn't
ask
for
anything
in
return.
We
were
friends,
and
when
I
showed
a
genuine
interest
to
learn
how
to
code
after
failing
and
failing
and
failing,
they
decided
to
help
me
out.
And
believe
me,
I
was
a
terrible
student.
I'd
get
confused
easily ,
yell
at
the
computer ,
throw
up
my
hands...and
every
time,
they
were
there
to
help
me.
They
say
it
takes
a
village
to
raise
a
child.
It
also
takes
a
village
to
learn
how
to
code.
So,
if
you
want
to
overcome
Bloom's
Two
Sigma
Problem
in
education,
find
someone
on
Twitter
who
loves
teaching...and
study
at
their
feet.
You
might
think
you're
inconveniencing
them,
but
quite
the
opposite.
The
people
who
love
to
teach
LOVE
TO
TEACH.
And
if
you're
willing
to
give
up
your
precious
ego
and
become
a
beginner
again,
your
teacher
will
appear .

The
Thankless
Beware
The
Messiah

I
once
helped
someone.
And
helped
and

and
helped.
And
it
was
never
good
enough.
Learn
from
my
mistakes.
Beware
of
The
Messiah
Complex.
Physician;
heal
thyself.
Sometimes
we
help
each
other
because
we
need
a
surrogate
activity .
An
activity
that
makes
us
feel
like
our
life
means
something.
Something
that
makes
us
feel
like
the
hero
instead
of
the
villain
or
the
sidekick.
It's
easy
to
get
lost
in
being
a
savior
because
the
rush
of
helping
someone
is
so
powerful.
But
you
can
lose
yourself
in

You've
heard

They're

is

the

Truth
is,
it

how
much
you
know

IF
YOU
DON'T

Paul
Portesi
on

has
a
phrase,
as
a

"Let

If
you

behind

Because
it
doesn't

what
you
say
-
it's
about
the

you

The
decisions
you
make
with
your

and
your

Some
of
these
folks
suffer
from
a
lack
of
David
Hume.
David
Hume
came
up
with
the
Is-Ought
fallacy;
just
because
you

WHAT

mean
you
know
WHAT

BE..
But
why
do
they
do
it?
Because
they

be
a

They
want
to
be
a

They
want
to
be
a
sage
on
a
stage,
with
a
crowd,
holding
court.
They
want
to
be
a
Judge
because
they
see
God
as
a
judge;
what
could
be
more
God-like
than
setting
yourself
on
a
pedestal?
Hegel
would’ve
called
it
the
Master-Slave
dichotomy;
in

It

that

you're

No?

You’re

Why
the
hell
are
people
on
𝕏
in
the
first
place?
Where
do
our
desires
come
from?
Girard
would
say
that
we
don't
choose
our
desires,
but
rather
observe
the
desires
that
OTHER
people
have,
and
COPY
them
by
copying
their
desires.
Maslow
would
say
that
we
progress
from
desire
to
desire,
from
desiring
food
to
security
to
love
to
self-esteem
and
then
self-actualization...whatever
that
means.
Others
would
say
that
our
desires
are
driven
by
the
fungus
in
our
brain.
Veblen
would
say
that
we
have
a
core
desire
to
convert
our
work
time
into
leisure
time.
He
says
that
we
act
as
if
The
Garden
Of
Eden
is
a
world
where
we
don't
work
anymore
and
eat
fruit
all
day.
Desire
-
Economists
would
call
it
DEMAND
-
is
something
Buddhists
would
call
the
root
of
all
suffering.
Some
say
craving
is
a
better
word.
Craving
is
the
root
of
all
suffering.
From
a
Consumer
Behaviour
perspective,
we
know
that
a
customer's
joy
reaches
its
pinnacle
the
moment
BEFORE
they
make
the
purchase.
Gamification
would
say
that
we
have
six
desires:
purpose,
mastery ,
autonomy ,
relatedness,
change
and
rewards.
Marketers
will
tell
you
that
they
can
invent
desire
through
word
of
mouth.
Economists
will
tell
you
that
demand
decreases
with
every
increase
in
price...but
that
doesn't
apply
when
you
think
of
diamonds
and
purses.
The
more
expensive
the
purse,
the
more
Demand
there
is.
Consider
that
Ferrari
had
the
same
profit
as
GM.
Why
give
your
girl
your
heart
when
she
only
wants
a
purse?

So
You
Think
YOU’VE
Got
It
Bad
SHAADDAAAAAPPPPP….
I
think
we're
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
risk
cannot
be
destroyed;
risk
can
only
be
transformed.
As
much
as
it
might
be
easy
to
despair
because
of
all
the
negative
environmental
externalities,
I
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
all
of
us
are
essentially
facing
the
same
negative
externalities.
The
race
is
still
going;
whoever
crosses
that
finish
line
is
who
we're
going
to
talk
about,
and
everybody
else,
we
won't
talk.
Now,
we
ask
ourselves…what
do
I
need
to
do
to
generate
revenue
on
X?
Now,
I
can
go
into
goals,
objectives,
plans,
strategies,
and
tactics.
I
could
talk
about
target
market
segmentation
or
the
six
environments,
like
the
political,
economic,
socio-cultural,,
technological,
competitive,
geographic…look:
you
could
have
a
PhD
in
business,
but
if
you
do
not
believe
in
yourself
and
believe
that
you
personally
have
control
over
your
own
situation,
I'm
not
sure
what
education
can
do
for
you.
I
see
a
lot
of
people
that
are
coming
to
this
country
for
the
first
time,
and
they
have
more
hope
in
their
eyes
than
the
people
who
have
been
here
for
a
long
time.
There's
a
saying,
'History
is
filled
with
the
sounds
of
silk
slippers
going
downstairs
and
wooden
shoes
coming
up.'
There
are
people
who
have
prepared
themselves
for
this
moment
and
those
who
have
not.
There's
no
easy
way
to
prepare
someone
for
the
fourth
industrial
revolution
overnight
because
software
has
eaten
the
world.
So,
how
do
you
bank
now
that
software
has
eaten
the
world?
How
do
you
build
a
career
now
that
software
has
eaten
the
world?
A
lot
of
people
think
they
should
become
a
data
scientist.
Sure,
we
could
become
software
engineers;
sure,
we
could
become
data
scientists.
But
I
think
when
things
get
so
confused,
our
compass
is
turning,
and
sometimes
we
forget
to
strike
that
balance
between
what
the
market
wants
and
what
our
soul
needs.
I
don't
think
there
is
an
easy
balance
there,
but
I
know
you
can't
be
on
any
one
extreme
for
too
long.
So
again,
if
you
feel
you
are
at
a
disadvantage
now,
you
are
probably
right.
But
I'm
sure
you
wouldn't
want
to
trade
positions
with
someone
who
may
not
be
where
you
are,
who
may
not
have
access
to
Wi-Fi.
We
have
never
been
presented
with
so
many
threats,
but
just
like
energy,
the
value
is
not
being
destroyed;
value
is
changing
hands.
If
you're
going
to
go
somewhere,
your
mentor
should
be
someone
who
has
gone
there
already.
And
you
can
find
that
Mentor
-
Talismans
included
-
on
X.
They’ll
help
you
defend
yourself
against
the
villains
you
never
knew
existed.

right?
Nope.
They’re

They’re

They

From
Mississippi
With
Love
…it’s
just
an
easy
stroll
…
You
know,
there's
been
this
AI
thing
popping
around
and,
you
know,
a
lot
of
people
feel
that
it's
kind
of
scary
and
some
people
feel
enlightened
about
it
but
until
you
actually
sit
with
it
and
think
about
what
can
I
do
with
it,
what
can
I
create
with
it
then
that's
where
you
need
to
come
and
listen
to
us
talk
about
it
and
come
listen
to
my
talk
and
and
I'm
the
low
man
on
the
totem
pole
when
it
comes
to
a
bucket;
mine
ain't
nowhere
near
as
full
as
some
of
the
guys
that
are
going
to
be
talking
you
know
we
all
look
and
see
what
it
can
be
and
what
we
don't
want
it
to
be
you
know
it's
I
don't
know
it's
just
an
easy
stroll
I
mean
there's
things
to
fear
and
then
there's
things
to
go
and
do
and
understand
and
that's
the
you
know
that's
the
approach
I've
always
taken
there
most
anything
I'll
do
is
go
understand
what
uh
most
people
you
know
especially
in
technology
and
computers
is
you
know
not
be
afraid
of
them
do
what
you
can
do
with
them
and
see
what
they
can
do
for
you
what
what
can
you
create
it's
like
taking
a
hammer
a
nail
on
the
board
and
a
saw
and
building
something
it's
the
same
same
thing
you
know
it's
just
that
you
got
to
move
on
it
and
because
there's
people
that
talk
and
they
Yeti
and
there's
people
that
worry
and
they
Yeti
but
they
just
won't
move
on
down
the
road
you
know
so
so
come
see
us.

A
Poem

Kweku
Nansi
Story
Once,
there
was
a
very
smart
man.
His
name
was
Kweku
Nansi.
He
used
his
intelligence
to
amass
a
great
fortune,
and
in
his
old
age,
after
conquering
commerce
and
politics,
he
wanted
to
give
back
to
his
community.
So,
he
decided,
"Hey,
why
don't
I
gather
all
the
world's
intelligence
and
put
it
in
a
bag
so
I
can
give
it
to
them
as
a
gift?"
He
traveled
the
world,
collecting
all
the
world's
knowledge
from
Buddhism,
Hinduism,
Islam,
Christianity,
Catholicism,
and
even
the
things
before
the
Nicene
Creed.
He
mixed
them
all
together
and
finally
had
the
most
perfect
body
of
knowledge
ever
in
his
backpack.
Taking
it
back
home,
he
pondered,
"How
do
I
share
it
with
everyone?"
Suddenly,
an
idea
struck
him.
"Oh,
I'm
going
to
put
this
knowledge
on
display
on
the
top
of
the
highest
tree
in
the
village
so
everyone
can
see
it."
He
put
the
backpack
on
and
started
climbing
the
tree.
Halfway
up
the
tree,
the
backpack
fell
off
his
back.
Perplexed,
he
thought,
"Oh,
that's
weird."
He
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
tree,
retrieved
the
backpack
with
all
the
knowledge,
and
started
climbing
again.
But
this
time,
three-quarters
of
the
way
up
the
tree,
the
backpack
fell
once
more.
Undeterred,
he
descended,
picked
up
the
backpack,
and
resumed
climbing.
Yet
again,
it
fell
off
immediately.
His
son,
who
had
been
watching
the
whole
thing,
spoke
up,
"Hey
Dad,
I
thought
you
knew
everything.
How
come
the
backpack
keeps
falling
off?"
The
man
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
wrong
from
the
start.
It's
impossible
to
put
all
of
the
world's
knowledge
into
your
head
because,
even
though
he
thought
he
succeeded,
he
still
couldn't
climb
to
the
top
of
the
tree
with
it.
And
so,
he
stopped
there,
enlightened
by
the
realization
of
the
limitations
of
knowledge.

DIVORCING

Divorcing
Language
It’s
cheaper
to
keep
her.
-
Jada
Pinkett
[Smith/Shakur]
Divorcing
Language
won't
be
easy.
In
fact,
Language
will
demand
alimony
payments
for
the
rest
of
your
life.
Huh!?
I’ll
explain.
You’ve
been
in
an
arranged
marriage
with
Language
this
entire
time.
You
got
married
to
Language
before
you
knew
how
to
say
Momma.
Ever
think
about
that?
But,
now
that
the
honeymoon
phase
is
over,
this
relationship
has
grown
toxic.
Naturally,
you’ve
been
thinking
about
getting
a
divorce
for
years
now,
but
there’s
just
one
problem…
…Language
made
you
who
you
are.
Without
language,
you
wouldn’t
have
made
it
this
far.
Language
got
you
that
fancy
job.
She
comes
to
work
every
day.
Even
helps
you
deal
with
your
asshole
boss.
Hell,
even
the
mistress
you
call
a
spouse,
you
landed
with
Language
as
your
wing-man.
Your
friends?
Your
besties?
They
only
love
you
because
Language
introduced
you.
If
you
got
divorced
from
language,
it
stands
to
reason
that
your
friends,
mistress,
and
boss
are
going
to
be
flabbergasted.
You’ll
become
a
lie
to
them.
And
they
will
probably
leave
you.
And
that’s
too
much
to
risk.
So
you’ll
stop
reading
here
and
stay
in
the
toxic
relationship.
Besides,
who
else
is
gonna
love
you
like
Language?
After
all,
your
words
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself.

--- Page 78 ---

The
Arranged
Marriage
Don’t
be
mad…just
know
it.
-
J.
Tenn-Yuk
How’d
you
get
married
to
Language
in
the
first
place?
Your
parents
decided.
You
didn’t
have
a
say
in
it.
How
does
that
make
you
feel?
To
know
that
the
way
you’ve
constructed
the
world
was
decided
by
your
parents?
“Me?
No,
not
me.
I’ve
constructed
my
own
reality
by
reading.”
Yes,
you’ve
read
a
ton
of
books…in
English.
That’s
cute.
You
probably
think
Francis
Bacon
invented
Empiricism.
You
probably
think
Euclid
was
the
Father
of
Geometry.
You
probably
think
The
Chakra
System
has
seven
colours
that
correspond
to
emotions.
Cute.
You
probably
even
read
The
Bible
in
English.
Even
cuter.
Be
real.
You’re
reading
translations.
Translations
made
to
marry
your
preconceived
notions
with
Buddhism
and
Hinduism
in
a
neat,
nice
package
that…it
just
seems
to
fit
so
well
together!
So
cute.
Adorable.
You
get
away
with
your
interpretations
because
you
don’t
know
anyone
who
reads
these
texts
in
their
original
language.
If
you
did
meet
someone
who
read
these
texts
in
their
original
language,
they’d
disagree
with
you
on
just
about
everything.
But
you
won’t
verify
what
you
believe
to
be
true…because
it’d
shake
the
foundation
of
metaphor
frameworks
you
rely
on
to
stay
sane.
So
hold
onto
those
provincial
ideas.
They’re
more
than
cute…they’re
your
identity.
And
who
am
I
to
tell
you
your
identity
is
completely
arbitrary
and
dare
I
say…bullshit.

--- Page 79 ---

Fuck
Off,
Grandpa
The
reason
that
Westerners
fall
in
love
with
Hinduism
and
Buddhism
is
very
simple:
Fuck
Off,
Grandpa
.
FUCK
OFF,
GRANDPA.
YOUR
IDEAS
ARE
OLD.
YOUR
IDEAS
ARE
ROOTED
IN
SLAVERY.
YOUR
ENTIRE
PATRIARCHY
ONLY
EXISTS
TO
LAUNDER
SLAVERY.
I’m
sure
you’ve
heard
these
arguments.
There’s
nothing
a
teenager
loves
more
than
to
flip
off
Grandpa.
The
best
way
for
a
teen
to
say
Fuck
Off
Grandpa
is
by
rejecting
Grandpa’s
religion.
That’s
the
ultimate
Fuck
You.
The
ultimate
Fuck
You
is
to
reject
the
belief
system
of
your
parents.
You’ve
heard
the
phrase,
“If
you’re
not
a
Liberal
in
your
20s,
you
have
no
heart.
If
you’re
not
a
Conservative
in
your
40s,
you
have
no
brain.”
A
lot
of
you
teenage
yuppies
will
reject
that
outright…and
it’s
because
you’re
biologically
wired
to
disagree
with
Grandparents.
You
see
the
Moloch,
but
aren’t
old
enough
to
understand
Hume’s
Is/Ought
Dilemma,
Just
because
you
know
what
is,
doesn’t
mean
you
know
what
ought
to
be.
-
Hume’s
Is/Ought
Dilemma
When
Westerners
who
are
searching
for
the
best
way
to
say
Fuck
You
Grandpapa,
Buddhism
and
Hinduism
are
a
PERFECT
FIT.
You
get
to
call
it
meditation
instead
of
prayer,
and
instead
of
the
ten
commandments
you
find
the
Noble
8-fold
path.
And
best
of
all,
Grandpa’s
PISSED.
He
spent
all
this
time
to
gift
you
the
live
you
enjoy
through
your
parents
and
you
have
the
NERVE
to
say
FUCK
OFF
GRANDPA!?

Why
Westerners
Are
Infatuated
With
Religion
All
Of
A
Sudden
The
reason
that
Westerners
are
infatuated
with
new
religions
is
very
simple:
AI.
Westerners
have
constructed
their
entire
identity
based
on
how
they
use
language.
And
now
that
machines
can
produce
better
writing
than
they
can…they
no
longer
associate
their
ability
to
create
sentences
with
their
sense
of
divinity.
So
what
happens
when
my
mastery
of
language
doesn’t
make
me
feel
connected
to
God
the
same
way
it
used
to?
What’s
the
easiest
way
to
regain
my
feeling
of
divinity?
Simple:
adopt
a
new
religion.

--- Page 81 ---

Western
Buddhism
Is
Christianity
all
about
prayer?
Yes
and
No.
Prayer
is
a
core
tenet
of
Christianity…but
it
isn’t
all
of
Christianity.
Is
Buddhism
all
about
meditation?
Yes
and
No.
Meditation
is
a
core
tenet
of
Buddhism…but
it
isn’t
all
of
Buddhism.
Is
Hinduism
all
about
Yoga
and
perfecting
your
Lotus
Position?
Yes
and
No.
Yoga
is
a
core
part
of
Hinduism…but
it
isn’t
all
of
Hinduism.
Is
Islam
all
about
Sujud,
bowing
praying
to
Allah?
Yes
and
No.
Bowing
praying
is
a
core
part
of
Islam…but
it
isn’t
all
of
Islam.
Do
you
see
where
I’m
going
with
this?
As
a
practice,
the
practice
of
Buddhism
can
be
summed
up
in
one
word:
shikantaza.
Shikantaza
means,
“...just
sit
there.”
Try
it.
Ask
someone
about
Buddhism
and
they’ll
tell
you
it’s
all
about
meditation…but
that’s
just
the
core
practice
of
Buddhism.
There’s
a
difference
between
practice
and
BELIEF
SYSTEM.
And
because
the
belief
system
of
Buddhism
is
antithetical
to
the
western
paradigm
of
identity
worship,
Westerner
buddhists
never
go
beyond
practice
because
they
can’t
stuff
buddhism
into
their
existing
model
of
reality.
Look.
Buddhism
has
three
core
tenets:
●
There
is
no
self
(anatta).
●
Everything
changes
(anicca).
●
Craving
causes
suffering
(dukkha)
Because
the
West
is
so
wrapped
up
in
Identity
Worship,
Westerner
Buddhists
can’t
wrap
their
heads
around
the
core
belief
system
of
Buddhism…so
they
make
up
whatever
the
hell
they
need
Buddhism
to
be
to
sell
the
course
or
dominate
the
conversation
at
the
work
Christmas
party.

You
Still
Kant
See
It?
Open
your
eyes.
What
do
you
mean
You
Still
Kant
See
It!?
LMAO.
You’ve
read
Kant’s
Critique
of
Pure
Reason.
[nod
yes
so
they
don’t
think
you’re
an
idiot]
Kant
said
that
reason,
logic,
and
rational
thinking
aren’t
enough
to
understand
reality.
Tell
someone
that
logic
isn’t
enough,
and
they’ll
call
you
a
blasphemer.
Enemy
of
God.
Misbeliever.
After
all,
who
can
disagree
with
a
well-laid
out,
logical
argument?
To
disagree
in
the
face
of
a
well-organized
argument
is,
after
all,
complete
madness.
Kant
saw
through
this.
He
recognized
that
our
parents
and
our
genetic
lineage
influence
our
selective
use
of
reason,
logic
and
rational
thinking
to
stay
internally
consistent.
After
all,
the
opposite
of
consistent
is
inconsistent,
and
how
can
anyone
be
successful
if
they’re
inconsistent?
Language
is
a
bitch,
ain’t
she?
Hard
to
argue
with
her.
She’s
so
organized.
She’s
got
it
together.
All
of
her
arguments
make
sense.
Kant
saw
through
this,
and
so
did
Bergstrom.
Ice
Ice
Bergy
called
it
the,
‘mechanical
encrusted
upon
the
living.’
This
was
the
idea
that
we
don’t
really
understand
why
we
do
things…but
are
fucking
amazing
at
making
up
stories
about
why
we
did
what
we
did.
Lettvin
proved
that
the
eye
organizes
information
before
it
gets
sent
to
the
brain.
And
naturally,
without
access
to
perfect
information,
all
of
the
logic,
reason,
and
rational
thinking
in
the
world
can’t
save
you.
It’s
like
trying
to
use
The
Pythagorean
Theorem
to
calculate
the
area
of
a
triangle
when
the
length
of
the
sides
was
measured
with
a
potato.
No
matter
how
good
the
formula,
without
access
to
correct
measurements,
London
Bridge
Is
Falling
Down,
feel
me?
Kant
called
the
‘mechanical
encrusted
upon
the
living’
a
different
name.
He
called
it
the
Synthetic
A
Priori.
Fancy
words,
I
know.
The
Synthetic
A
Priori
is
all
of
the
things
that
influence
your
selective
use
of
reason,
logic,
and
rational
thinking.
Things
like
your
parents,
your
culture,
your
geography;
these
determine
the
thoughts
that
can
occur
to
you.
If
I’ve
lost
ya,
don’t
worry.
You
can
paste
this
into
chatGPT
and
it’ll
clear
it
up.
Here
I’ll
show
you
you
lazy
asshole.

and
Rationality
We
excel
at
fabricating
explanations
for
our
behaviors.
Immanuel
Kant's
groundbreaking
work,
the
Critique
of
Pure
Reason,
challenges
the
idea
that
reason
and
logic
alone
can
unveil
the
truth
about
reality.
His
premise
disrupts
the
conventional
belief
that
logical
arguments
are
the
sole
pathway
to
understanding.
Influence
of
Personal
Factors
Kant
observed
how
our
upbringing
and
genetic
lineage
shape
our
use
of
selective
reason,
logic,
and
rational
thinking.
He
highlighted
the
impact
of
these
influences
in
maintaining
internal
consistency
,
questioning
the
notion
of
pure,
unbiased
logic
as
the
ultimate
guide
to
truth.
Bergstrom's
'Mechanical
Encrusted
Upon
the
Living'
Bergstrom's
concept
of
the
'mechanical
encrusted
upon
the
living'
exposes
our
limited
awareness
of
the
reasons
behind
our
actions.
This
notion
suggests
that
despite
our
inability
to
fully
comprehend
our
motives,
we
excel
at
fabricating
explanations
for
our
behaviors
.
Lettvin's
Eye
and
Information
Processing
In
Lettvin’s
groundbreaking
paper,
‘What
The
Frog’s
Eye
Tells
The
Frog’s
Brain’,
Lettvin's
discoveries
regarding
the
eye's
role
in
organizing
information
before
reaching
the
brain
shed
light
on
how
our
sensory
systems
filter
and
interpret
external
stimuli
before
conscious
awareness.
Kant's
Concept
of
Synthetic
A
Priori
Kant
coined
the
term
'Synthetic
A
Priori'
to
encapsulate
the
various
factors
influencing
our
selective
use
of
reason,
logic,
and
rational
thinking.
These
encompass
elements
such
as
cultural
background,
geographical
location,
and
parental
influence,
which
shape
the
range
of
thoughts
available
to
an
individual.
Conclusion:
Beyond
Conventional
Rationality
Despite
our
reliance
on
reason
and
logic,
Kant's
insights,
alongside
Bergstrom
and
Lettvin's
contributions,
underscore
the
limitations
of
purely
rational
thought.
Understanding
the
influences
that
mold
our
cognitive
processes
expands
our
perspective
beyond
traditional
notions
of
logic-based
understanding
.

SECTION
TWO:
SO
YOU
THINK
YOU’RE
HINDU

--- Page 86 ---

Westerners
Hinduism
Have
you
ever
met
Caucasian
Hindus?
They’ll
tell
you
everything
about
Hinduism.
Guaranteed,
they’ll
teach
you
about
Chakras.
White
people
LOVE
chakras.
But
it’s
more
than
love…chakras
are
SEXY.
They’re
sexy
because
white
people
have
their
own
interpretation
of
chakras…and
it
just
happens
to
coincide
with
the
western
psychologists.
What
they
won’t
tell
you
is
that
their
seven-chakra
system
is
just
one
of
many
chakra
systems.
What
they
won’t
tell
you
is
that
their
associations
of
psychological
states
with
the
seven
chakras
was
never
mentioned
in
the
original
hindu
texts.
What
they
won’t
tell
you
is
that
the
colour
associations
with
each
chakra
is
from
a
book
from
1971,
not
2500
BCE.
And
they
won’t
tell
you
any
of
this
because…they
can’t
read
sanskrit.
So,
they
have
to
rely
on
interpretations.
And
because
nobody
really
gives
a
shit
about
translations,
white
Hindus
can
make
up
just
about
whatever
the
hell
they
want
about
Hinduism
as
long
as
it
fits
within
their
western
view
of
religion.

The
Secularization
Of
Yoga
So
you
think
you’re
exercising
In
many
parts
of
the
world,
yoga
has
been
largely
secularized
and
is
primarily
practiced
as
a
form
of
physical
exercise
and
stress
relief.
While
this
has
made
yoga
more
accessible
and
beneficial
to
many
people,
it
also
risks
diluting
or
overlooking
its
spiritual
and
philosophical
dimensions,
which
are
integral
to
its
traditional
roots.
Here’s
a
table
showing
the

these
days
and
they’ll
explain
what
they’re
going
through
in
terms
of
their
narratives
that
HAVE
BECOME
THEIR
RELIGION.
Similarly,
societies
bend
religion
to
serve
their
goals.
Did
Augustine
believe
in
Christianity
when
he
converted?
Debatable.
Do
Presidents
believe
in
God?
They
better
seem
like
they
do
if
they’re
going
to
be
elected
President
in
the
US.
Here’s
the
main
point:
we
don’t
follow
religion.
We
follow
the

Here’s
What
Hindus
Would
Think
About
Westerners
Chakras
The
Western
interpretation
of
Chakras
often
simplifies
complex
spiritual
concepts
deeply
rooted
in
Hindu
philosophy.
Associating
Chakras
with
psychological
states
and
body
parts
may
oversimplify
their
significance
in
Hindu
spiritual
practices.
Chakras
are
multifaceted
metaphysical
centers,
and
reducing
them
solely
to
psychological
or
physiological
attributes
might
distort
their
deeper
spiritual
meanings.
The
most
well-known
and
commonly
referenced
chakra
system
in
the
West
is
derived
from
Hindu
Tantra
and
Yoga
traditions,
particularly
from
texts
like
the
"Shat
Chakra
Nirupana"
and
the
"Yoga
Upanishads."
This
system
delineates
seven
main
chakras
along
the
central
channel
of
the
subtle
body,
known
as
the
Kundalini
system.
Sir
John
Woodroffe
(also
known
by
his
pseudonym
Arthur
Avalon)
was
a
British
Orientalist,
scholar,
and
writer
who
extensively
studied
Hindu
Tantra.
He
emphasized
and
popularized
the
Kundalini-based
chakra
system
in
his
writings.
Woodroffe's
works,
such
as
"The
Serpent
Power"
and
"The
Garland
of
Letters,"
extensively
discuss
and
elaborate
on
the
seven
chakras,
their
attributes,
symbolism,
and
practices
associated
with
Kundalini
Yoga.
Woodroffe
played
a
significant
role
in
introducing
and
interpreting
Tantra
and
the
chakra
system
to
the
Western
audience
during
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries.
His
focus
on
the
Kundalini-based
chakra
system,
its
symbolism,
and
its
connection
to
spiritual
awakening
and
inner
transformation
has
had
a
lasting
impact
on
how
these
concepts
are
perceived
and
understood
in
the
West.
However,
it's
important
to
note
that
his
interpretations
and
emphasis
on
this
particular
chakra
system
are
just
one
among
several
different
interpretations
found
in
the
vast
landscape
of
Hindu
and
yogic
traditions.
Deity
Associations:
The
link
between
Chakras
and
specific
deities
in
the
Western
interpretation
might
be
seen
as
arbitrary
or
overly
generalized.
Hindu
scriptures
depict
various
deities
with
multifaceted
attributes,
and
while
some
deities
may
have
symbolic
associations
with
certain
Chakras,
the
direct
correlations
depicted
in
the
table
could
be
considered
oversimplified
or
lacking
in
authenticity.
Elemental
Associations:
Hindu
philosophy
often
describes
elements
as
fundamental
components
of
the
universe
and
the
human
experience.
While
the
elements
(earth,
water,
fire,
air,
ether)
are
acknowledged
in
Hindu
cosmology,
their
direct
linkage
to
specific
Chakras
in
the
Western
interpretation
might
be
viewed
as
a
reductionist
approach
that
oversimplifies
the
complex
interplay
of
elements
within
the
spiritual
context.
Opening
and
Closing
Methods:
The
prescribed
methods
for
opening
and
closing
Chakras
in
the
Western
interpretation
might
not
align
with
traditional
Hindu
practices.
Hindu
spiritual

--- Page 90 ---

practices
such
as
meditation,
pranayama,
mantra
chanting,
and
Kundalini
awakening
techniques
involve
a
holistic
approach
that
goes
beyond
mere
physical
exercises
or
breathing
techniques.
The
oversimplification
of
these
practices
might
overlook
their
spiritual
depth
and
intricacies.

Of
Completeness
Chak

Just
because
it

to
you
doesn’t
make
it

It
just
means
it
makes
sense
to
you.
And
sometimes,
that’s
good
enough.
When
people
talk
about
Chakras,
they’re
most
likely
talking
about
the
interpretation
of
Hinduism
by
Woodroffe,
NOT
what
was
written
2000
years
ago.
Now,
just
because
something
is
new
doesn’t
mean
it’s
false,
far
from
it.
But,
it’s
important
to
understand
the
true
lineage
of
your
thoughts.
In
the
absence
of
knowing
the
true
lineage
of
your
thought,
you
end
up
making
up
stories
about
how
things
really
are.
Alan
Watts.
Terrence
McKenna.
Timothy
Leary.
Richard
Alpert
(you
probably
know
him
as
Ram
Dass).
These
are
the
Mount
Rushmore
of
Westerners
that
have
done
the
hard
work
of
translating
Buddhism
and
Hinduism
for
Californians
eager
to
say
Fuck
Off
Grandpa.
Their
teachings
are
gorgeous
because
they
have
the
seduction
of
completeness.
The
seduction
of
completeness
is
when
new
ideas
fit
so
well
in
our
current
understanding
that
they
MUST
BE
TRUE.
Most
of
the
West’s
understanding
of
Hinduism
is
from
Woodroffe,
who
published
Serpent
Power.
I
say
published
because
the
book
was
ghost-written
by
an
Indian
Lawyer.
What
most
people
don’t
realize
is
that
Woodroffe
didn’t
translate
everything
word
for
word.
Rather,
the
doctrine
of
the
tantras
in
his
writings,
“...emerges
as
a
refined
subtle
philosophy,
its
erotic
and
magic
elements
either
marginalized
or
reinterpreted
in
an
ethical
or
rational
light…”
What
that
means
is
that
the
translations
Woodroffe
CHOSE
to
publish
are
not
the
entirety
of
Hinduism,
but
rather
the
interpretations
he
CHOSE.
Again,
I’m
not
saying
to
throw
away
your
“knowledge”
of
the
“chakra
system.”
If
you
want
to
believe
in
a
reality
where
the
chakra
system
maps
onto
the
human
body
in
a
way
that
completely
and
perfectly
fits
with
western
medicine
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
Hindu
Gods,
I’m
cool
with
that.
In
fact,
I’m
not
telling
you
to
do
anything.
Believe
in
the
God
of
your
own
understanding.
I
LOVE
RAM
DASS,
MCKENNA,
LEARY
&
WATTS.
But
I’m
realistic
enough
to
know
that
there’s
a
limit
when
it
comes
to
relying
on
third
party
translations
when
it
comes
to
understanding
religion.

St.
Augustine’s
Failed
Experiment
Because
who
doesn’t
love
a
good
wedding?
You
know
St.
Augustine,
right?
[nod
your
head
so
you
don’t
embarrass
yourself]
If
you
ask
people
what
St.
Augustine
did,
they’ll
tell
you
that
he
married
Catholicism
with
Plato’s
teachings.
St.
Augustine,
a
significant
figure
in
Christian
theology
and
philosophy,
lived
in
the
4th
and
5th
centuries
AD.
His
philosophical
and
theological
works
were
heavily
influenced
by
his
earlier
engagement
with
the
teachings
of
Plato.
However,
it's
important
to
clarify
that
Augustine
did
not
literally
"marry"
Plato
and
Catholicism;
rather,
he
merged
certain
aspects
of
Platonic
philosophy
with
Catholic
Christian
thought
in
his
writings.
Augustine
was
initially
attracted
to
Manichaeism,
a
dualistic
religion
that
he
followed
for
a
time
before
converting
to
Christianity.
Before
his
conversion,
he
encountered
various
philosophical
ideas,
including
those
of
Plato.
Plato's
philosophy,
particularly
the
concept
of
the
Forms
(ideal,
abstract
entities
that
exist
beyond
the
physical
world)
and
the
notion
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul,
resonated
with
Augustine.
These
Platonic
concepts
influenced
his
early
thought
processes.
After
his
conversion
to
Christianity,
Augustine
sought
to
reconcile
certain
philosophical
ideas
with
Christian
doctrine.
He
used
Platonic
philosophy
as
a
framework
to
address
theological
questions,
such
as
the
nature
of
God,
the
problem
of
evil,
the
immortality
of
the
soul,
and
the
concept
of
divine
illumination.
One
notable
area
of
influence
was
Augustine's
idea
of
the
existence
of
eternal
truths
or
forms
in
the
mind
of
God.
Augustine
adapted
Plato's
notion
of
the
Forms
to
fit
within
a
Christian
worldview
by
suggesting
that
these
eternal
truths
were
in
the
mind
of
God
rather
than
existing
independently.
However,
Augustine
also
critiqued
certain
aspects
of
Platonism,
especially
its
lack
of
emphasis
on
God's
direct
involvement
in
the
world
and
its
understanding
of
the
physical
world
as

--- Page 95 ---

inherently
flawed
or
less
important
compared
to
the
realm
of
ideal
forms.
Augustine's
view,
informed
by
his
Christian
beliefs,
emphasized
the
goodness
of
the
physical
world
as
God's
creation.
In
summary,
Augustine
integrated
certain
elements
of
Platonic
philosophy
into
his
Christian
theology,
borrowing
concepts
such
as
the
nature
of
reality
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul.
He
attempted
to
harmonize
these
philosophical
ideas
with
Christian
doctrine,
aiming
to
strengthen
Christian
thought
by
using
the
tools
of
Platonic
philosophy.
Nevertheless,
he
also
diverged
from
Plato
in
some
key
areas,
emphasizing
the
importance
of
God's
direct
involvement
in
the
world
and
the
goodness
of
the
physical
creation,
elements
central
to
Catholic
Christian
teachings.

Words
Too

Now ,
each

when
I'm

I
invariably
think
of

from
the

that
says,
"He

and
he

And
I
see
the
absolutely
bizarre

of
my
predicament.
I
realize
that
I
have
to
be
both
of
those—I
have
to
be
that
part
in
me
that
is
not

and
the

that's

Hopefully ,
they're
connected.
If
you
are
open
to
the
possibility ,
let
the
words
merely
quiet
your
minds,
and
let's
meet
on
the
other
level
where
we
meet
in
the
silence
between
the
words.
We
come
together
to
speak
about
the
Unspeakable
because
the
rational
analytic
mind,
the
intellect,
only
knows
objects;
it
only
knows
what
it
can
think
about.
What
we
come
together
to
talk
about
are
really
matters
of
the
heart
that
are
known
subjectively ,
not
objectively .
They
are
always
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
thinking
mind.
Yet,
I'm
in
the
word
business,
so
we
just
have
to
take
the
words
very
lightly .
A
very
great
Mystic
poet,
Rumi,
once
said,
"I
am
a
sculptor ,
a
molder
of
form.
In
every
moment,
I
shape
an
idol,
but
then
in
front
of
you,
I
melt
them
down.
I
can
rouse
a
hundred
forms
and
mix
them
with
spirit.
But
when
I
look
into
your
face,
I
want
to
throw
them
into
the
fire."
The
"you"
in
this
case
being
the
Beloved
or
that
higher
part
of
ourselves.
Our
minds
keep
creating
realities.
We
keep
creating
models
of
ourselves.
We
keep
creating
expectations
about
the
world.
We
create
these
forms
of
clay,
and
we
try
to
breathe
life
into
them.
But
the
minute
you
look
directly
into
the
eyes
of
forms,
they
all
seem
to
dissolve
before
your
eyes,
and
you're
left
speechless
or
heartful.
