# Ted Nelson on Royalties, Payments, and the Web

**Direct quotes from Ted Nelson's writings on automatic micropayments, royalties, and electronic publishing**

## The Publishing System Must Include Royalties

> "What does this mean exactly? Well, a publishing system, as we see it, should include provisions for privacy, copyright, royalty and accounting."

## Automatic Proportional Royalties

> "We can therefore have a system of electronic publishing that feeds to your computer screen exactly what you ask for, as soon as you ask for it; with royalties divided between the document owners in exact proportion to how much of their materials are transmitted or used."

## Published Materials Yield Royalties

> ""Private" materials are available only to their owners or designees; "published" materials are available to anyone, yielding a royalty to the owners."

## Royalty for Use: The Automatic System

> "In our planned service, a standard proportional fee is paid automatically by the user to the owner every time a fragment is summoned. Each owner must consent to the standard royalty-- say, a few cents per screen hour-- and each reader contributes those few cents automatically as he reads along. If the back-end cost of servicing a user is, say, $2 per screen-hour, then the royalty will be 5¢ to 10¢ for that hour. This is deducted automatically from the back-end fees."

## Royalties Based on Transmission Time

> "Since there is no controlling what happens at the user end, this royalty should be largely based on transmission time. An hour, five minutes, or one second of a thing, each contribute proportionally to the copyright holders' accounts. (The question of whether to allow different rates of royalty will be discussed later.)"

## The Royalty Goes to the Owner

> "The royalty goes to the owner. We say "owner" here to avoid having to distinguish between authors and publishers; but this is a matter of private arrangements that is of no concern at the system level."

## Automatic Royalties Solve the Copyright Problem

> "The windowing approaches already mentioned automatically furnish a general solution to the "copyright problem" with regard to quotation and citation, simply by this means: authors who are windowed automatically get royalties as well. If the windowing document is electronically published, royalties are paid to the owner of each document seen in proportion to its use."

## Quote Anything, Royalty Always Paid

> "Since the copyright holder gets an automatic royalty, anything may be quoted without further permission. That is, permission has already been granted: for part of the publication contract is the provision, "I agree that anyone may link and window to my document." Publication through such a net requires your permission for your work to be quoted ad lib. You publish something, anyone can quote it, you always get a royalty automatically. Fair."

## Splitting Royalties Between Original and Modifier

> "If a modified document is read, the original owner and the modifier split the royalty in proportion to who wrote what, as determined automatically. (For royalties on links, see "Tuning," Chapter 2.)"

## Example: Hamlet and Modified Versions

> "Now, the obvious rules of the road should be as follows:
> 
> 1. Shakespeare's Hamlet is of course unchanged and available instantly.
> 
> 2. Jewett's modified version of Hamlet, composed almost entirely of the original, is also available instantly. (Jewett may give it any title he wants.)
> 
> 3. Shakespeare-- or presumably the Authors' Fund--gets the royalties for whatever of Shakespeare's Hamlet is summoned by readers.
> 
> 4. When people read Jewett's Hamlet, the Authors' Fund still gets the royalty on Shakespeare's behalf almost all the time. But Jewett gets a minute proportional royalty for the change he has made, whenever a reader encounters that part."

## No Royalty for Privashed Documents

> "An author who wishes to render his work universally available, but wishes also to retain the right to withdraw it at any time, has a simple means for so doing. He simply designates his document as a private document with unrestricted distribution. Anyone may have access to it or use it, but the owner is free to withdraw it or change it irreversibly at any time.
> 
> No royalty is received for the use of privashed documents."

## Private Sale of Information

> "Those information purveyors not satisfied with our private rates are free to store what they like as private encoded documents and then sell access, or sell the secret code to make them readable, or whatever. This is a private transaction and does not involve the system."

## Printouts and Royalties

> "Users are thus free to make printed copies for their own use. Note that if a user prints out a document, he has paid a royalty on its transmission. It is paid, just as a paperback bought at the drugstore has had its royalty paid up. And if a copyright holder cannot be satisfied with this arrangement-- even knowing no other is possible-- he had better withhold his stuff from this system."

## Royalty Fees and Maximums

> "Copyright must of course be retained, but a universal flexible rule has to be worked out, permitting material to be transmitted and copied under specific circumstances for the payment of a royalty fee, surcharged on top of your other expenses in using the system.
> 
> For any Individual section of material, such royalty should have a maximum: i.e., "by now you've bought it."
> 
> Varying royalty rates, however, should be the arbitrary choice of the copyright holder; except that royalties should not vary sharply locally within a tissue of material. On public screens, moving between areas of different royalty cost must be sharply marked."

## The Web and Payment Systems

> "Public awareness of the Web began on a large scale about 1994. Shop windows, secure payment systems began, 'shopping cart' conventions build up, and people begin actually buying things. Smashing old industries on every side, threatening every form of commerce and business and providing startling new opportunities, the new way of doing business confuse everyone into a variety of sometimes-idiotic strategies. To do nothing seems worse than doing something, anything."
