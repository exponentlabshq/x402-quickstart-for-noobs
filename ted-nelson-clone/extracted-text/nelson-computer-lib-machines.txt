This U the flip Bide of Computer Lib. 
(Peel free to beg-in here. The oiher aide 
la Just If you want to know more about computers, 
which are changeable devices for twiddling sym­
bols. Otherwise skip It.) 
(But if you change your mind It might 
be fun to browse.) 
In • sense, the other side has been a 
come-on for this side. But it's an honest come-
on: I figure the more you know, the readier 
you'll be for what I'm saying here. Not neces­
sarily to agree or be "sold," but to think about 
it in the non-simple terms that are going to be 
necessary. 
The material here has been chosen largely 
for its exhilarating and inspirational character. 
No matter what your background or technical 
knowledge, you'll be able to understand some of 
this, and not be able to understand some of the 
rest. That's partly from the hasty preparation 
of this book, and partly from the variety of in­
terests I'm trying to comprise here. I wsnt to 
present various dreams and their resulting dream 
machines, all legitimate. 
If the computer is a projective system, or 
Rorschach Inkblot, as alleged on the other side, 
the real projective systems-- the ones with pro­
jectors in them-- are all the more so. The things 
people try to do with movies, TV and the more 
glamorous uses of the computer, whereby it makes 
pictures on screens-- are strange inversions 
and foldovers of the rest of the mind and heart. 
That's the peculiar origami of the self. 
Very well. This book-- this side, Dream 
Machines-- is meant to let you see the choice 
of dreams. Noting that every company and uni­
versity seems to insist that its system is the 
wave of the future, I think it is more important 
than ever to have the alternatives spread out 
clearly. 
But the "experts" arc not going to be much 
help; they are part of the problem. On both 
sides, the academic and the industrial, they are 
being painfully pontifical and bombastic in the 
jarring new jargons (see "Babels in Toyland,'1 
p. Lf ). Little clarity is spread by this. Few 
things are funnier than the pretensions of those 
who profess to dignity, sobriety and profession­
alism of their expert predictions - especially 
when they, too are pouring out their own personal 
views under the guise of technicality. Most peo­
ple don't dream of what's going to hit the fan. 
And the computer and electronics people are like 
generals preparing for the last war. 
Frankly. I think it's an outrage making it 
look as if there's any kind of scientific basis to 
these things; there is an underlevel of technicality, 
but like the foundation of a cathedral, it serves 
only to support what rises from it. THE TECH­
NICALITIES MATTER A LOT, BUT THE UNIFYING 
VISION MATTERS MORE. Technology fs an expression of man's dreams. If man did 
not Indulge Ms fantasies, his thoughts alone would inhibit the 
development of technology Itself. Ancient visionaries spoke of 
distant times and places, where men flew around and about, and 
some could see each other at great distance. The technological 
realities of today are already obsolete and the future of 
technology is bound only by the limits of our dreams. Modern 
communications media and in particular electronic media are 
outgrowths and extensions of those senses which have become 
dominant 1n our social development.

IS HOT cunm*/ This book has several simultaneous Inten­
tions: to orient the beginner In fields more 
complex and tied together than almost anybody 
realizes; nevertheless, to partially debunk 
several realms of expertise which I think de­
serve slightly less attention than they get; 
and to chart the right way, which I think uniquely 
continues the Western traditions of literature, 
scholarship and freedom. In this respect the 
book is much more old-fashoned than it may seem 
at the gee-whlz, very-now level. 
The main ideas of this book I present not 
as my own, but as a curious species of revealed 
truth. It has all been obvious to me for some 
time, and I believe It should be obvious as well 
to anyone who has not been blinded by education. 
If you understand the problems of creative think­
ing and organizing Ideas, If you have seen the 
bad things school so often does to people. If 
you understand the sociology of the intellectual 
world, and have ever loved a machine, then this 
book says nothing you do not know already. For every dream, many details and intri­
cacies have to be whittled and Interlocked. Their 
joint ramifications must be deeply understood by 
the person who is trying to create whatever-it-is. 
Each confabulation of possibilities turns out to 
have the most intricate and exactly detailed results. 
(This is why I am so irritated by those who think 
"electronic media" are all alike.) 
And each possible combination you choose 
has different precise structures implicit in it. 
arrangements and units which flow from these 
ramified details. Implicit in Radio lurk the 
Time Slot and the Program. But many of these 
possibilities remain unnoticed or unseen, for a 
variety of social or economic reasons. 
Why does it matter? 
It matters because we live In media, at 
fish live in water. (Many people are prisoners 
of the media, many are manipulators, and many 
want to use them to communicate artistic visions,) 
But today, at this moment, we can and mudt 
design the media, design the molecules of our 
new water, and I believe the details of this design 
matter very deeply. They will be with us for a 
very long time, perhaps ss long as man has left; 
perhaps if they are as good as they can be, man 
may even buy more time-- or the open-ended 
future most suppose remains. (See "Endgame," 
p. WT •) 
So In these pages I hope to orient you some­
what to various of the proposed dreams. This Is 
meant also to record the efforts of a few Brewster 
McClouds, each tinkering toward some new flight 
of fancy in his own sensoarium. 
But bear in mind that hard-edged fantasy 
is the corner of tomorrow. The great American 
dream often becomes the great American novelty. 
After which it's a choice of style, size and fin­
ancing plan. 
The most exciting things here are those 
that involve computers: notably, because compu­
ters will embraced in every presentational medium 
and thoughtful medium very soon. 
That's why this side is wedded to the other: 
if you want to understand computers, you can take 
the first step by turning the book over. I figure 
that the more you know about computers-- especial­
ly about minicomputers and the way on-line sys­
tems can respond to our slightest acts-- the better 
your imagination can flow between the technicali­
ties, can slide the parts together, can discern the 
shapes of what you would have these things do. 
The computer is not a limitless partner, but it is 
deeply versatile; to work with it we must under­
stand what it can do, the options and the costs. 
My special concern, all too tightly framed 
here, is the use of computers to help people 
write, think and show. But I think presentation 
by computer is a branch of show biz and writing, 
not of psychology, engineering or pedagogy. 
This would be idle disputation if it did not have 
far-reaching consequences for the designs of the 
systems we are all going to have to live with. 
At worst, I fear these may lock us in; at best, 
1 hope they can further the individualistic tradi­
tions of literature, film and scholarship. But 
we must create our brave new worlds with art, 
zest, intelligence, and the highest possible ideals. 
I have not mentioned the emotions. Movies 
and books, music and even architecture have for 
all of us been part of important emotional moments. 
The same is going to happen with the new media. 
To work at a highly responsive computer display 
screen, for instance, can be deeply exciting, 
like flying an airplane through a canyon, or 
talking to somebody brilliant. This is as it 
should be. ("The reason is, and by rights ought 
lo be, slave to the emotions." -- Bertrand Russell.) 
In the design of our future media and sys­
tems, we should not shrink from this emotional 
aspect as a legitimate part of our fan tic (see p. 
Dr\4? ) design. The substratum of technicalities 
and the mind-bending, gut-slamming effects they 
produce, are two sides of the same coin; and to 
understand the one is not necessarily to be 
alienated from the other. 
Thus it is for the Wholiness of the human 
spirit, that we must design.

One individual I know, who relishes his 
counterculture image, told me with angry and 
shaking voice that he doesn't believe in copy­
right and that anything that gets near his 
computer belongs to him. Well, don't leave 
your manuscripts near such a person. (Why is 
it always the guys with cushy and secure jobs 
who tell you tweedle de dee, ideas should be 
free, and patents and copyrights are selfish?) 
Actually, for the individual, one of the 
strongest forms of protection available is 
copyright. Far from obsolete, the copyright 
makes publishing, and the better computer 
software, possible. (It is not generally 
known that copyright violation is a felony.) 
(And ripping off a program you're supposed to 
pay for is not a brave guerrilla affirmation, 
like hitting Harold Geneen with a pie, but 
grand larceny.) 
Now that Altairs and LSI-lls have got a 
lot of you guys dreaming about selling soft­
ware, an important question is how to protect 
your work. Well, you have a champion. 
Calvin Mooers (see pp. 18-21) is not only 
a genuine Computer Pioneer From The Forties, 
but, along with Herb Grosch, pioneered the 
Computer Counterculture. Grosch flaunted a 
beard in front of old man Watson, Mooers 
strove to make computers easy to use— back 
when that was unheard of. 
One of his current interests is in ways 
that small independent underground-type pro­
grammers can protect their developments. He 
and some associates are exploring the possi­
ble formation of a group for the legal pro­
tection of small software producers and owners. 
Incidentally, when you think something 
you've written belongs to you— a computer 
program, poem or whatever— slap the following 
at the beginning, under the title: 
(<=) 1975 frving Snerd 
substituting, of course, your own name. And 
the year currently in effect. If computer prin­
ting is used, (C), using parentheses, is consi­
dered an acceptable substitute for c-in-a-circle 
This not only gives notice to potential 
Borrowers, but it has certain strong magical 
properties as a legal incantation. See your 
lawyer for details, but don't hesitate to apply 
it liberally to your own work; you may be glad All the DM numbers are supposed 
to be on this side only. They poop out 
at number 59, and were intended merely 
for cross-reference. 
.pmi p^^^ p^^i 
It began with a bang last Christmas: the 
cover of Popular Electronics showed 'a computer 
you dan build yourself for only $400'. 
It was real. A young firm in Albuquerque 
called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Sys­
tems, or MITS, had finally done it: a computer 
for well under $1000. In a box not much bigger 
than a typewriter, a machine comparable to the 
Univac I. They called It the Altair 8800. 
Of course, in a way this was an obvious 
step. The MITS computer was simply the pack­
aging, as a computer, of a specific integrated 
circuit chip that had been on the market for 
some months. This chip, the Intel 8080, is a 
microprocessor, or two-level computer (see p. 
44), generally employed for fixed purposes In 
cash registers, pinball machines, and the like. 
However, to make it a "general" computer— with 
the engineering, hookups and accessories that 
entailed— would be no small catter if taken 
seriously. O r-* M

Next in computer hobbyiem will 
obviously be the Computer Van. 
Already vans come with swivel 
thrones, four-track stereo, 
color TV; so this next etep 
is obvious. But most important, 
recreational vehicles can be 
purchased on very long time-
plans, sometimes seven yeare. 
{HITS has a demo van with Al­
tair, floppy disk, lineprinter. 
It drives around showing off. 
But they'll sell you one like 
it for a trifling $28,000.) 
Now for mobile operation we 
redo the power supply... •Wf 
1975 may be thouyht of as the year in which 
the computer underground suddenly appeared in 
full force. The Altair was probably the big 
crystallizing event. 
Not that there wasn't a counterculture be­
fore. There were the games-players at every uni­
versity, the prank programmers (see p. 4B-9), and, 
wherever computers are the center of things, a 
shared experience of misch^ief and breakthrough. 
There was Computer People for Peace, a cliquey 
and unapproachable group with booths at the con­
ferences (at least, their backs were always 
turned when you wanted to ask questions). There 
was the hobby fringe. 
But now it's gone different. Instead of 
pretentious company names meant to appeal to ob­
tuse businessmen, like Performance Measurement 
Systems Consultants Group and Bottom-Line-Tronics, 
the new companies have rock-group names like 
General Turtle, Inc., The Sphere and Loving Grace 
Cybernetics. In this new computer counterculture, 
the main computer companies are not IBM and 
Honeywell and Univac, but DEC and MITS and Gen­
eral Turtle; the standard computer is not the 370, 
but the 11 (or possibly the Altair or the 8). 
The standard language is not Fortran or Algol or 
PL/I, but BASIC. Instead of the big color TV 
that middle America wants, the underground compu-
ternik dreams of his own graphic setup forever 
running The Game of Life in color (see pp. 48-9 
and pic p. DM26). (Of course that'll also re­
quire the color TV; see "Bit Maps," p. Z.) 
In such a world, computers are not a tool 
but a way of life. Tte computer is toy, pet, 
checkerboard, music box and TV. Computers are 
for making music, computers are for getting people 
together via community memory, computers are for 
letter-writing, computers are for art and movie­
making and the animated decoration of the home. 
Computers are for games; a vast number of 
interactive game-programs are published and 
swapped around. Almost all are in the BASIC 
language. (Bob Albrecht's WHAT TO DO AFTER YOU 
HIT RETURN is said to be definitive— S7.50 from 
People's Computer Company, 1919 Menalto Ave., 
Menlo Park CA 94025. See also their magazine 
PCC, as well as Simulation and Gaming News.) 
PLATO games, a somewhat different subspecies, are 
discussed on p. DM27. 
The underground computer magazines have be­
come a blizzard (see box). Albrecht's sprightly 
and successful PCC, originally oriented toward 
high and grade schools, has now branched into 
hobbyism as well. On the hardware side there is 
The Computer Hobbyist, and now a slick new hobby 
magazine. Byte, with a first printing of 50,000. 
On the educational side there is a swell new 
magazine called Creative Computing. 
Then there is the Community Memory movement. 
The basic idea of Community Memory is to have a 
computer resource of information and ideas, com­
monly available. In its more glorified and mys­
tical form, the idea seems to be to have a place, 
inside the computer, where information can be 
shared by The People, free of institutional ob­
struction or the profit motive. 
This vision is perhaps unclear to others 
besides the author, but it attracts a variety of 
people interested in some form of grass roots 
revitalization of our society. Some of these are 
disillusioned sixties radicals who look to "com­
munity organization" as a building block for a 
new society; others are interested in more nuts-
and-bolts applications, such as trying to make 
barter a viable economic form again, in an urban 
society with many nonstandard leftovers, skills 
and wants. (Presumably this would work by having 
the computer find pairs of people with matching 
wants and tradables; or even search out potential 
trades around multi-person rings.) 
The first of these systems was Resource One, 
in San Francisco; I saw another Community Memory 
in Vancouver, which seemed to be in practice a 
sort of animated classified-ad system. A user 
Bitting at the terminal can put in ads of his own, 
and can search through the entire file for key­
words of interest. As there is no censorship, 
some rather surprising things get in there, for 
which I wish we had room. 
(A newsletter of such projects. Community 
Communications, is being started by Lee Felsen-
stein. Loving Grace Cybernetics, 1807 Delaware St., 
Berkeley CA 94703.) 
Even for those coming anew into the field 
the radio hams and amateur telescope makers who've 
laid their Master Charge cards on the line for the 
Altair— computers represent a new social life. 
Amateur computer clubs have drawn startling num­
bers: for instance, the Los Angeles and San Fran­
cisco groups are currently pulling 100 members to 
their weekly meetings. (In San Francisco, con­
tact Fred Moore, 55B Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo 
Park CA 94025.) 
This book and its surprise success probably 
rate mention of some sort in the world of under­
ground computerdom, '74-75; although my under-
ground status may be in jeopardy. I had intended 
to bypass the computer establishment, and cer 
tainly not expected to become assimilated therein; 
so the dozens of university class adoptions have 
come as a considerable shock, as have the accep­
tance and legitimation I had long since given up 
on. My heartfelt thanks for this response, and 
I'll try to live up to it. (How is discussed on 
p. Z, last column.) 
But folks, this all is the merest beginning. 
As it says on diametrically the other side, p. 3, 
COMPUTERS BELONG TO ALL MANKIND.

Oi you might oat an LSI-11. An LSI-11 
buying pool la being formed by Hal Lashley, 
Southern Cal Co-putar Society, P.O. Box 987, 
•;. Faeaden* CA 91030. 
Processor Technology, 2465 4th St., Baikal ay 
94710, Bakes a text diaplay kit for tha Altair 
for SI to (you aupply tha IV Bon i tor and avldantly 
tha keyboard). 64 character par Una, 16 linaa. 
Bootstrap Enterprises, Ann Arbor, are alao 
working on • similar unit, cal lad "Tha Dumb Ter­
minal," with a color option. 
MITS ii ccaaa.ittad now to building a vidao 
tarmlnal, the CT-B096, that will provide both 
text and graphic*. Following specs are not final. 
fBtf « T» 8* ficeo. 
It will have a keyboard and video monitor, 
plug straight into tha Altair, and refresh fron 
Altair memory aodul**— which nay double as reg­
ular aemory, if you don't Bind garbage on the 
It will have 34 lines of upper-case charac­
ters, SxB dots to the character, SO characters 
to the line on a built-in nonitor. In addition 
lt will offer graphics from bit nape (see p. Z>, 
either 130x130 or 340x340. (Tha resolution will 
be switch-selectable, if you have enough buffer 
memory; a screen of text takes 2K, so does a 
130x120 picture, and 240x240 takea a whole 4K.) 
Buffer nemory will also be divldabla Into sepa­
rate *pagea" of text or graphics; and two pagea 
will be super impoaable, interlacing alternate 
video fields (see pp. CM6-7). Hota that refresh­
ment Is from randon-acce**, rather than serial, 
memory, so that sultlple fields cannot be overlaid. 
While none haa been announced as yet, a anisic 
iynthesiier that plugs into the Altair will alaoat 
certainly be available in 1976. 
(Mote that thi* could provide an entirely new 
form of interactive terminal if used with the 
tfachspres* equipment; see nearby.) 
) tha Altair ia in the 
DEC's own floppy dlak, for the B and 11, 
finally came out. Price for II i S3000 for one 
drive, S4000 for double. 
LHJctape, which la virtually the sane as 
DECtape but unpatented, has just come out at 
S2000 for one drive, Including controller and 
interface to 11 or Hova (interrupt-driven). 
Mote that the unit is compact and rugged, and nay 
be sore suitable than disk or cassette for those 
of us concerned about portable rigs and van-
nounting. Computer Operations, Inc., 10774 
Tucker St., Beltsville MD 20705. (The bad news: 
software costs S300 for the driver, plus S750 
> DEC if - operating syst n FT-11.) 
Cambridge Memories, Inc., cleverly sells 
main nemory banks for the 11 which can attach t< 
to two PDP-iia at once— thus connecting the 
two machines without using DEC's expensive 
Unibus coupler. 
Also for lls^ Formation, Inc., sells a 
curious programmer's console that traps and dis­
plays the last sixteen Unibus addresses refer­
enced; and Pabrl-Tek offers a cache aeaory for 
the PDP-11/45.

Naaorn, for soae unfathonabl* raaaon, built 
in tha early 70s a conputer Intended to be upw«rd-
cosfiatlbla fro- the 360/20. But lt waa not a 360. 
Why did they do thla? The hind of people who 
ahop around would not buy 360/20a, and tha kind of 
people who buy J60/20a would scarcely leave IBM's 
skirts at upgrade tlaa. 
Thua the Fvrnorex 40 has, quite understandably, 
been discontinued. And ell the ones thay had left 
•re waiting for you brand new up at American Used 
Cosjputar for •jh4' heart-stopping price of 
icludes 48k byte! 
Now for the bad news. 
It cones bare-bones, with no software, and no 
hardware support. Vou get the wiring dlag/raa with 
it, and a liat of other owners, and you're on your 
own. AUC does have spare parts, however. And 
peripherals, ax>stly Bore expensive. 
Mr. Ma no son of AUC told na on tha phone that 
it had 156 instructions, including 64-bit floating 
point, 32-bit binary. On studying the literature, 
however, it appears to Be that the instruction-set 
he described is Blcroprograsaaed, with the micro-
coda Intended to be read in at startup tine. 
(There are 65 microinstructions.) Maybe you can 
gat the microcode for those 158 instructions and 
Baybe you can't. Maybe you don't care, If you're 
well enough fixed to handle one of theae. 
It cones in basic blsck, 2x5x4 feet, fits in 
a van, and supposedly does not need aircondltlon-
ing. Supposedly plug-compatible with 370 peri-
phexala! It's really a sixteen-blt nachlne, and 
it haa sight sets of eight registers, having been 
designed to perform up to eight functions sinul-
tanaoualy. 
So. 64 Bain registers, 4K dynamic Microstore, 
48K of memory, for about the prlc* of a used PDP-
11/10 with tr. smelling aalts, anyone? 
"Diobolo" uas a game of the tuenties that in­
volved poking a spinning object. Oddly, that's 
uhat today's Diablo involves. 
Redoubtable Max Palevsky, who brought you 
Scientific Data Syatems (which Xerox bought and 
recently shut down). Rolling Stone and the movie 
"Harjoe"-- has another winner, which he's also 
sold to xarox. 
This is the Diablo company, which first 
made disks and now makes a sensational printing 
aachine• It has a whirling plastic "daisy 
wheel" of type, interchangeable, and can type 
30 characters per second in either direction, as 
as well as draw pictures— of a sort. 
Tha basic difference between these prin­
ters and conventional typewriters, like the Sel­
ectric, 1* their use of servos rather than rat­
chets. This neans their characters can be posi­
tioned in nany intermediate positions, unlike 
the fixed position* available on an ordinary 
typewriter, for instance, the Diablo can posi­
tion the type to 1/60 of an inch horizontally 
and 1/48 of an inch vertically. (Nice for justi­
fied typesetting.) 
There are new a number of machines of this 
kind. First came the Diablo printer, officially 
the HyTypa 1; then the engineers who built that 
went off and created a competitive printer called 
the pUME (pron.'kyoom'); now there's an improved 
Diablo HyTypa II; Interdata makes a competitive 
unit, the Carousel printer, with a little print 
cup) and to Bake things totally confused, there's 
a special model Diablo called the 800, which 
can't be connected to computers but is sold for 
office use as a "word processor." 
A nuBber of companies stake terminals in the 
SS000 ballpark embracing on* or the other of 
these printers. Gen-Corn systems makes one around 
the Diablo; Anderson-Jacobson makes one around 
tha gUME. Xerox makes Its own computer terminal, 
the 3010, around tha Diablo I— which, it should 
be noted, can be rented for as little a* three 
months, at S190/month. 
Tha one everybody wants for their computers 
1* called the Xerox BOO, but so far thst is not 
available a* a computer terminal. It goes faster 
than the other Diablos and offers typefaces that 
look beautiful for typesetting; mucfi nicer, it 
seems, than the type* currently available for the 
other Diablos. 
For those Interested in just hooking up the 
printer mechanism, for substantially less money 
than a whole terminal, interfaces for hooking 
the Diablo or QUME printers to PDP-8 or PDP-11 
are available fron Data Systems Design, Inc., 
1122 University Avenue, Berkeley CA 94702. 
SUGGESTIONS TO XEROX COttCBRSIllG DIABLO PRINTERS. 
No charge. 
1. Sell the 800 as a terminal, for goodness sake. 
2. Failing that, make those pretty typefaces 
available for the othsre. 
3. Already you offer black and red ribbons; a 
blue and yellov ribbon Mould permit printing 
PICTURES IS FULL COLOR, a development of 
great interest to the many aomputer graphics 
freaks. 
4. However, that uould require somewhat finer 
positioning of the platen; say, 1/120 in both 
directions. 
£. ... failing uhiah, you could put out a "graphic 
daisy uheel" vith intermediate dot positions 
equivalent to dot positions between those 
now available. 
6. Could the Diablo somehow be made to sound leas 
like a dentist's drill? 
7. How about a portable? 
Dan Hillis and Radio Parlaan, of tha LOGO 
group at MIT, are working on a special "preliter-
•te" terminal to allow non-reader* (possibly in­
cluding chimps and gorillas) to program in LOGO, 
especially on tha General Turtle 2500 (see "Min-
sky's Computer," nearby). Plastic credit cards 
will have symbola for ths various picture and 
music-box functions. To write a program, or 
create a movie on the scope, th* ueer will Insert 
function cards in slot*. Color coding will be 
used for program transfer, a red card means "Jump 
to tha red aubroutln*." Sine* thi* 1* MIT, the 
full recursive power of tha ay at am will of course 
be available. (My hope is that chinpanieea and 
other little .alotnlka can be taught recursive 
program definition. Than will th* public wake up

I asked Dan Hillis, a member of the group, about 
the possibility of Installing th* 2500 in a van. 
"Think of it as a recreational vehicle with th* 
van optional," he said. 
What makes possible the computer c 
culture and everything else is, of course, the 
spectacular development of electronic chip tech­
nology, the techniques of shrinking great elec­
tronic circuits to almost no site. Electronic 
rigs that were ahoebox-size ten years ago are 
typically now etched on chips the size of your 
thumbnail and sold for a few dollars, no matter 
what they contain. 
A few years ago, the chips only contained 
building block*, such as registers— units for 
holding information temporarily. But now in 
the mid-seventies they have come to contain 
whole computera, or large sections of them. 
(The distinction between microprocessors and 
computers is taken up on p. 44.) 
The first biggies were from Intel: the BO08 
and then the 8080, a chip that has become the 
heart of the Altair (see p. X), as well as rival 
computer*. 
New computer chips keep coming out: people 
keep telling me to mention specific ones, but I 
can't keep track of them. The Motorola 6800 
seem* popular; it will soon be the heart of new 
computer* from MITS and SPHERE (see p.W and Y). 
(An augmented and faster copy of the 6800 i* re­
putedly being sold by HOS Technology for S30.) 
Another interesting computer chip is the PACE 
microprocessor from National Semiconductor, with 
four working registers and a ten-word stack; 
with 16K memory it costs $500. (The PACE is 
hidden in an automatic drink mixer and boot* 
inventory controller from Electro Units Corp., 
San Jose, Calif. Adjusts prices to hours and 
can even water the drinks precisely. Claimed 
to make absentee ownership of bar* practical.) 
Because of chips, the price of computer main 
memory is collapsing apace. Something like a 
dollar a word in the sixties, it is something like 
like a dime a word now. But Intel now offers a 
•torago chip holding 16K bit* for SSS, which is 
3C a bit, and a friend of nine estimate* that 
memory chips will cost 1/10 of a cent per word in 
1976. 
These cost collapses cause many to predict 
the end of disk and tape. But that's premature. 
While these Eappier chips hold a lot for a little, 
their contents disappear whan the lights go out. 
Until laser-punched tape comes along, disk and 
magnetic tape will be very much with us as long-
term and oackup storage devices. 
Because of the action in chip technology, 
a potential Important movement in computer design 
may have been passed over: the "macromodulas" de­
veloped at Washington University in St. Louis by 
. (father of the original DEC modules). 
and B >clat 
Th* basic idea of the mscromodula approach 
was to have conputer subsection* that ware com­
pletely interpluggable. With them you can build 
•ny computer, to your own design, in a couple of 
days. The syatem exists now and it work* just 
fine: counters, registers, memoriae can ba at­
tached quickly by cable. 
Unfortunately, the cost 1* high and they 
haven't found a manufacturer. With chip prices 
falling, and chip know-how widespread, it's hard 
to justify charging ten or so time* as much for 
component* juat because they can ba plugged to­
gether faster. (Juat as unfortunately, every­
thing in the aacronodule system is built on lec­
tions of twelve bits.) For this reason the St. 
Louis folk are having trouble getting commercial 
sponsorship. However, perhaps Soms bright hun­
gry chip company, reading this, would like to 
get into the aacronodule game. And presumably

removed. We'll see later 
what it finally looks 
like. 
Unsatisfied with the structure of normal

LISP like a bat out of bell.

The halftone systfea of IfUMRRO, rumored on 
p. DM38, Is reel. Clever indeed: it divides the 
half-tone problem into tvo parts, one the orig­
inal picturing of the scene, the other its pres­
entation in the terminal. That means that their 
system permits one central Image generator to 
send out pictures to as many terminals as de­
sired. Unlike the Watkins Box (see p. DM37), 
whose half-milllon-dollar opulence can be poured 
only on a single user at once, in this system 
the central resource can be distributed among 
various users, with each one's picture changed 
Intermittently, or poured on a single user for 
full animation. Currently it runs in Portran, 
transmitting encoded pictures to the unusual ter­
minals required (built around Trinitrons). But 
a special central processor is foreseen. 
The system is called CHARGE, and Ron Swallow, 
its developer, la Indeed a hard charger. (Soft­
ware: Bill Underbill and Roger Gunwaldsen.) 
Swallow's game isn't movies or engineering gra­
phics; he wants CHARGE to compete head-to-head 
with PLATO (see pp. DH26-7). And at the prices 
he> talking about— 55000 por terminal and

the first time on the PBS "Ascent of Man" series, 
where a screen drawing of Early Man's skull was 
seen to rotate and gradually change In its fea­
tures. This waa startling even if you know about 
computer graphics, since it seemed to be proceed­
ing from complex data concerning the entire 
skulls and their changes. 
Not so. Actually what you saw was a series 
of skull drawings by Peter Foldes, a Parisian 
artist, with the computer generating transitional 
drawings between them. (Indeed, though you saw 
Prof. Bronovskl next to the screen, you did not 
see him next to the screen at the same time the 
drawings were changing— because that had to be 
filmed very slowly.) 
The system was created by Nestor Burtnyk and 
Marcelli Wein, of the National Research Council 
of Canada. It currently runs only on »n SEL 840A. 
(It was also used by the National Film Board of 
Canada for creating Foldes" splendid film "Hun­
ger.") They can preview by rolling through bit­
map video on a moving-head disk. (See Burtnyk

(TV Guide, 16 Aug 75, p. 7.) Because of the grave 
difficulties of engineering— inaccuracies in pun­
ching the center hole mean the track can't help 
being off center, for instance— some of us are 
skeptical. 
Two systems have been confidently announced. 
Philips, the firm that gave us the audio cassette, 
has a system that will follow the spiral track on 
the disk from underneath with a laser. The disk 
turns at 30 revolutions per second, or one turn 
per TV frame, so it can supposedly freeze on one 
frame when desired. 
The other system is from RCA, which has 
a long history of Be-too announcements, but st 
least two of them made it big (the 45 record and 
the color TV system now used in the USA), so RCA 
should not be dismissed out of hand. Their disk 
system will supposedly go at 450 rpm (7.5 revol­
utions/second) , but they still mean to track it 
with a needle. The man from TV Guide says he's 
seen it and it works perfectly, but I -«tould per­
sonally look for hidden wires. 
(MCA, an entertainment conglomerate, has 
hitched up with Philips and printed a catalog of 
all the movies they will supposedly make available 
on disk for the "MCA-Philips" try a tew— such as 
Dee-try Rides Again for around ten bucks. This is 
probably just a bluff: with the price of audio 
records what they are, no way is a movie going to 
cost ten bucks. But it makes RCA look weaker, 
which is probably the purpose.) 
The prospect surprised them, but MAGI (see 
p. DM36) allows as how they might let you make 
movies on their over-the-phone movie-making setup 
(sketched on p, DM36). Price to capable out-
ders, if the software meshed, would be about $50 
an hour. (six hours makes one minute of film, 
not counting the phone bill. Cheap if you know 
movie economics.) 
Meanwhile, John Lowry, at Digital Video Lab­
oratories in Toronto, has been developing high-
quality video suitable for transfer to theatrical 
film. He and they have developed a 655-line 
color system— with heavy digital enhancement 
(see "Picture Processing," p. DM10). I scarcely 
believe my notes, but I saw it, and wrote down 
that it was comparable to 3Sam studio color. 
The day of "electronic cameras"-- that ie, film-
quality video— may be upon us soon. 
About 1972, there was announced an electron­
ically-controlled color filter that could change 
to any hue in nanoseconds. That would be Just 
**hat we all need for color movies from COMs—

The price of the GT40 display (see p. DM21), 
which all in all is one of the best displays on 
the market, has just dropped to S6500. To dis­
guise this pride drop, DEC gives you the smaller 
tube and no keyboard. 
And at the low end, a firm called Megatek 
in San Diego offers line-drawing CRT controllers 
for $1000 to $3000. All permit animation. You 
have to supply the oscilloscope. Their equipment 
plugs into the PDP-11 or the Nova, or in one 
case connects in tandem to an ASCII time-sharing 
terminal (!). 
The 11 and Nova models work directly from 
BASIC; your program in Basic puts line lists in 
the device's buffer memory. The time-sharing 
model converts incoming line lists from ASCII to 
binary and stores them internally. 256 lines 
with 6-bit resolution cost $1900, $110°and S1600 
for 11, Nova and t-s respectively; 1024 lines 
with 10-bit resolution cost S2800, S2000 and 
S2500 respectively. (Nova and 11 models can be 
completely updated in two refresh cycles, yiel­
ding as much animation as anyone can decently 
expect for the price. Software is supplied to 
provide display output from Nova, PDP-11 or time­
sharing BASIC; also t-s Fortran.) 
Meanwhile, for the hands-on electronics guy. 
Optical Electronics, Inc. makes all kinds of ro­
tation modules. You can build your own 3D rota­
tion setup out of their modules for a couple of 
thousand; but, of course, the fancy digital I/O 
for high-speed refreshment is not available. 
An interesting capability of the OEI equipment, 
though, is that you can build 4D- or even SD-
rotation systems out of their modules. Hmmni. 
Excellent manuals on the PLATO system and 
TUTOR language are now available from CERL, Uni­
versity of Illinois, Urbana. 
The next generation of PLATO terminals is 
coming down the line. The microfiche projector 
is withering away, as was easily foreseeable; 
meantime, steps ore being taken toward a more 
high-performance terminal, by putting a computer 
in it. This is being done both by Jack Stifle, 
who has done it with the Intel chip, and Roger 
Johnson, who haa the panel interfaced to an 11. 
(11 fans please note the implication: it is pos­
sible that the interface may be marketed.) 
Meanwhile, PLATO-like terminals (the model 
AG-60) are about $5000 from Applications Group, 
Inc., P.O. Box 444B, Kaunas, Ohio 43537. Note 
that these have standard non-PLATO interfaces 
and standard keyboards, but the Owens-Illinois 
plasma panel (erroneously called Corning else­
where in the book) blazes in all its glory. TIT W$

COLOR 
Extra bit maps, plus electronics, can get you 
color; if you double the number of bits you can 
double the number of available colors on your dis­
play, ad infinitum. 
On the small side, 64x64 color wll shortly 
be available for the Altair from the Digital Group, 
Denver. A 128x128 color bit-map system for the 11 
has just been announced by DEC (for "nuclear medi­
cine" of all things— but they will part with it 
to anybody for 8 or 10 thousand (not yet fixed)), 
ihey stress that this will be the first of a modu­
lar series of bit-map displays, with plugins for 
different degrees of resolution and different 
character generators. 
Ramtek and Comtal both make 256x256 bit-map 
systems, priced in the $16,000 area. 
Above this resolution special TV systems tend 
to be necessary. Both Ramtek and Comtal make very 
expensive systems for the purpose, using 
solid-state and disk respectively. 
You may or may not have heard of the Advent 
TV projector, the most glorious TV thing there is. 
It costs $3500 and projects a four-foot picture in 
the best TV color you can find. A lot of guys are 
bit-mapping to it. 
At MIT they've got bit-map color on the Ad­
vent at better than 400x500 resolution. (An option 
planned for the Flying Turtle (see p. Y) will al­
low its core memory to be used with the Advent as 
a bit-map display refresher.) At Comtal they're 
going for 1000x1000 on the Advent, rejiggering the 
electronics fron scratch. 
The most spectacular demonstration of bit-map 
color so far has no doubt been the film done by 
Dick Shoup et al. at Xerox PARC (see p. X), show­
ing the super animation that's possible when big-
computer resources are given over to bit-map ani­
mation. Their system is 600x800. 
All those scoreboards and wisecracking light-
grids, now that they are computer-controlled, 
raise all kindB of possibilities for non-frame 
animation. The big ones cost in the millions; a 
snail one for shopping centers costs a hundred 
grand (Millenium Info Systems, Santa Clara CA).

them, and add coordinate grids. It's $2500, and 
obviously great if you're bonkers for 2D graphs.

heart, for many delightful and 
witty conversations on problems 
of patent, copyright snd the 
vagaries of intellectual prop­
erty. Any harebrained ideas on 
these topics expressed here, 
however, are almost assuredly 
ay own. 
For much of the informa­

grateful to Bob Albrecht of 
PCC, mentioned here and there. 
Finally, special thanks 
to Commander Hugo McCauley, 
better known to you as Hugo's 
Book service, for his yeoman 
performance in shipping out 
the books— not to mention car­
rying them up and down stairs, 
typing the mailing labels, 
checking for bad ones, and 
sending out all those notes of 
apology when we were out of 
books again and again and again. 
And to long-suffering Lois and 
Megan McCauley, my especial 
gratitude. 
WHATEVER 
The sea-to-shining-sea 
Nelson Empire now consists of 
a lot of unsold books, a 1K Al­
tair and a second pair of shoes. 
My scheme for taking on Appren­
tice Generalists may have to 
wait awhile. So may Computer 
Lib, the film. But just wait. 
Speaking of which, what 
about this book, hey, now? 
Eventually there will be 
a new edition. Yes, the type 
is horrendously small, and that 
will have to be fixed. But 
that involves new negatives for 
every page, an expenditure of 
thousands of dollars, and some 
reconsideration of how this 
should all be set up. 
There have been several 
interesting plans. One was to 
split the contents of this book 
into three books, add material, 
enlarge the type and have them 
each this size and price. Ten­
tative titles were Computer Lib 
/Dream Machines, Computers 
Arise./Computers Arouse!, and 
Guerrilla Computing/Electronlc 
Monkeyshim 
for Guerrilla Computing: ring 
Kong climbing the front panel 
of a 370 holding Patty Hearst. 
(I also daydreamed about put­
ting out a 10-volume encyclo­
pedia in the same format, em­
bracing psychology/sociology, 
biology/evolutionary strategy, 
history (as strategy) /more his­
tory (as mood and feeling), 
revolution versus continuity 
(a two-sided position paper)... 
the Gem-Maniacal Encyclopedia'™. 
But reason has prevailed, and 
such forays have been postponed 
indefinitely. 
The present plan is for 
Computer Lib to be rewritten 
and reset in bigger type, at 
least 256 pages, with at least 
9 color pages and color cover. 
(We're talking about fall '76 
or later.) Price will have to 
be S15. If you think that's a 
rlpoff you can still get this 
one. (A number of people have 
complained to me about the $_7 
price tag of this volume. Have 
they ever bought other books?) 
Later I would like to put out 
an anthology of my favorite ar­
ticles in the field, using the 
Computers Arise'./Computers 
Arouse 1 title and format, and 
with some good 3D if possible. 
In any case, I want to stay in 
the publishing game; I haven't 
had so much fun in years- oth­
er projected volumes include 
The Inner Beyond, by Sheila 
McKenrle; Dirty Driving and the 
Strategy of Traffic by "Driver 
Edj" and The Nelson Computer 
Glossary. Soon I hope to be 
able to typeset from my own 
computer, and possibly to share 
this facility. 
This has been a most in­
teresting year. I have bean 
pleased to meet, and otherwise 
enjoy, the variety of clever, 
charming and/or lubricous per­
sons who have sought me out 
since the book first appeared; 
as well aa all the speaking en­
gagements, soirees and whatnot. 
I am delighted to receive 
relevant material and communi­
cations of any kind, although 
problems of time, disorganisa­
tion and mood often preclude 
a Personal Type Reply. 
It haa been a real lift for 
my morale to share some of these 
Ideas and enthusiasms with a 
wider public at last. It is 
you, finally, who have to carep 
and I am very glad you do. 
As to the most important 
matters, there is a news black­
out for tha indefinite future. 
Please stand by. 
Next year in Xanadu.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
Everybody at Chicago Circle Campus 
has been very sporting about this project. 
I am grateful not only for the encourage­
ment and assistance of various individusls 
(especially Joseph I. Upson, David C. 
Miller and Samuel Schrage), but for the 
atmosphere of support which has made this 
possible. My thanks to the Department of 
Art and the Office of Instructional Re­
sources Development for freeing me from 
teaching duties, to the Computer Center 
snd the Department of Chenistry for let­
ting me use pictures of their equipment, 
and everybody for their encouragement. 
I would like to thank the Walt Disney 
organization for their permission to de­
pict their wonderful characters, and ev­
eryone else who furnished materials and 
permissions for the things herein. 
Thanks also to those who looked over 
some of the material, especially Herbert 
Grosch of Cowputerworld, Dan McGurk of 
the Computer Industry Association, and 
William Rodgers. In 1 important sense this ia not no. 
eful the I am particularly grati 
many who have explained computers to ne 
over the years, especially Dave Denniston, 
Robert Fenichel, Andrew J, Sinner, John 
R. Levine. 
My thanks to Tom Barnard for some of 
the early typing, and for the Porta-Xan. 
I am grateful to Computer Decisions 
magazine for their good will, and help in 
researching computer imago synthesis. 
My roommate Tom DeFanti, mentioned 
elsewhere in this book, has been consid­
erate beyond the call of duty in giving 
over all the first-floor rooms of our 
house to this project for six months. 
My thanks finally to the many others 
whose good will has kept me going, in 
particular my former wife and eternal 
friend, Deborah Stone Nelson. 
Special greetings to ny friend and 
neighbor, Mrs. John R. Neill: I hope you 
enjoy the uses which your husband's il­
lustrations of Tik-Tok the Machine Man 
have found here. 
Lastly, for her contributions to 
morale (and for not footprinting the 
pasteups}, let's have a warn hand for 
Pooky the Wonder Dog. The machines, and toys, and involvement* 
we buy Into, are in but a small proportion of 
cases owned simply as scores, for their eo.t 
a* consumption symbols. 
Rather, we buy things lhat REPRESENT 
IDEALS. hoping ourselves lo partake of *ome 
abstraction or image-- the Playboy man, the 
Smart Businessman, the Clever Homemaker. 
Each product tries lo tell us it is the key­
stone of a way of life, and then, at least at that 
moment of purchase, we step into, wc embrace 
that Way of life, covering ourselves with the 
feeling, the aura, the magic we saw in the com­
mercial. 
Thl* ia not materialism. It Is wishful 
grasping at miasma. (Following sentence op­
tional.) It is communion, with the object seised 
simply the Objective Correlative of a hoped-for 
tranasubstantistion. (Sorry.) It's a seeking, 
not to possess,4 lo belong. 
D.W. GRIFFITH-- took the movie-box and created 
[he photoplay. no longer n twisted stage 
production. 
WALT DISNEY-- created a hypnotic pantheon of 
kindly and innocent semi-animals, senti­
mentally universal, generally acceptable. 
JOHN W. CAMPBELL-- as author and then editor 
•f Astounding, turned American science-
fiction from the Buck Rogers space opera 
to the human story, built around thought-
out premises and structures. 
IVAN SUTHERLAND— programmed and systematized 
a computer setup for helping people think 
and work with dec ply-structured pictorial 
information. (See p.ihl)-) 
DOUG ENGELBART— foresaw the use of computer 
screens as a way of expanding the mind, 
and over the last decade and a half has 
brought about just that. 
And more, and on. 
The occasional Oz ill us [rations are ail by 
John R. Neill. from various out-of-copyright Oz 
books by L. Frank Baum, especially Ozma of Oz 
and Tik-Tok of Oz. Tik-Tok. the Machine Man, 
is the figure to whom occasional allegorical sig­
nificance is attached here by Juxtaposition.

computer is a Rorschach, and you make of it 
some wild reflection of what you are yourself. 
There is more to it than that. 
America la the land where the machine is 
an intimate part of our fantasy life. 
Germans are too literal, they can get off 
on well-oiled cogs. The French are too vague. 
(I've noticed thai German science-fiction maga­
zines had covers of machines nnd planets; French 
science-fiction magazines, of dragons and people 
with wings. Our science-fiction covers show 
people with machines. Intimately, emotionally.) 
German fantasy Is icy and impersonal, French 
fantasy too personal, and American fantasy is 
splat In the middle, uniting both: man and 
machine, means and ends, emotion and details. 
Men always longed to fly. but it was here 
that they first did. This is the land of the 
MOVIE, a fantasy fabricated with endless diffi­
culty using various kinds of equipment.

This is the land of the kandy kolor hot 
rod, the Hell's Angel chopper, the drive-in 
movie. And the wild hotrod, in fact, is Just 
the flip side of the deep-carpeted Cadillac: each 
is a fantasy, an extension of its owner's image 
of himself in the world. 
Thus it was not an historical accident, 
but utterly predetermined, that in the hands of 
Americana the computer would become a way of 
realizing every conceivable wild fantasy that 
was dear to them. 
This is perfectly all right. This is as it 
should be. This ia the best pert of our culture. 
Not "Let a hundred flowers bloom," but "Let a 
hundred gizmos clank." This has sped immeas­
urably the imaginative development of many dif­
ferent things we might want. I try here fairly 
to explain a few differences among them. 
There la just one problem with all this. 
Now that all these things exist, or come nearer 
to existing, which ones will other people want? 
What will it be possible for everyone to have? 
And how can we tie all these things together?

It aeema different companies are all the 
time introducing wonderful new devices that will 
revolutionize, uh. whatever it is we do with, uh, 
information and stuff. Thing's you'll attach to 
your TV to get highbrow programs or dirty movies. 
Microfilm devices that will shrink the contents 
of the Vatican Library to a dot on your glasses. 
Goggles that show you holographic color movies. 
A pince-nez that lets you see the future. And 
so on. 
Reading Popular Mechanics or the Saturday 
review of patents in the New York Times, you 
get the idea of Something Big, New and Wonder­
ful About to Happen, so we'll all have access to 
anything, anytime, anywhere. 
But it's been that way for decades, and 
with certain exceptions hasn't happened yet. 
Here are some things that have caught on, 
and are mostly familiar to ua all. 
Book. Newspaper. Magazine. Radio (AM). 
Phonograph record (78). Tape recorder. 
Black-and-white television. Radio (FM). Phono­
graph record (33). Phonograph record (45). 
Color television. Tape cartridge (i"). Tape 
cassette (Philips, ca. 1/8"). Stereo records 
and tapes. Oh yeah, and movies: 35mm, 16mm, 
8mm. Super 8mm. Carousel projectors. View-
master stereo viewers. 
Here are some things In the process of 
catching on (and not assured of success): 
Quadrophonic sound. Dolby. Chromium, dioxide 
tape emulsion. Super 16 movie format. 
But for everything that did catch on, dozens 
didn't. Some examples: 12-inch 45 rpm records. 
11.5 millimeter movies. RCA's ,-inch tape cart­
ridge, which became a model for the much smaller 
Philips. Wire recorders. 
Then there are the things that caught on 
for awhile and went nway. Stereopticons (and 
their beautiful descendant, the Tru-Vue, which 
I loved as a kid). Cylindrical recordings. 
Piano rolls. And so on. 
Then there are the video recording sys­
tems. CBS' EVR died before it got anywhere. 
RCA's SelectaVision isn't out yet. 2-inch quad 
is standard in the studios, |-inch Porta-Pak 
is standard among the Video Freaks, and it looks 
like Sony's 3/4" cartridge will win as the main 
sales and storage medium. (The Philips system 
here looks as though it won't make it, and 1-inch 
is dubious.) But what's this we hear about 
video disks (twenty-five years after they announ­
ced Phonevision. Ah, well.)? 
The thing is, so many of these things seem 
to sound alike. They ell mention "information 
retrieval," education, technology, possibly "the 
information explosion" and "the knowledge in­
dustry." Press releases or effusive newspaper 
articles may use phrases like "space-age," 
"futuristic," "McLuhanesque" or even "Orwellian" 
(though few people who use that word seem to 
know what Orwell stood for; see p ). 
And the intimidating company names! 
Outfits with names like General Learning, Inc., 
or Synergistic Cybernetics, Inc., or even 
Communications | Research (Machines, Inc. 
Surely such people must know what they are 
doing, to use such scientific-sounding phrases 
as these! 
Then there are the business magazines. 
In the late sixties they were talking about "The 
Knowledge Industry" (a fiction, it turned out. 
of an economist's lumping a lot of things together 
oddly). Now they talk about the Cable TV out­
fits and the Video Cartridge outfits as though 
they're the cat'B pajamas.

Having Bpent some considerable time around 
and among these areas, I have developed consid­
erable cynicism and a bad case of the giggles. 
Originally it all seemed to fit together and to be 
leading somewhere, but talking to people at all 
levels, and either giving advice or trying to 
interpret the advice of others, I am convinced 
that what we have here in this whole audio­
visual-presentational whizbang field is nothing 
less than a very high order of collective insanity. 
The strange way companies adopt and drop var­
ious product lines, and verbalize what they think 
they are doing, seem to me a combination of 
lemmingism and a willingness to follow any Auth­
ority in an expensive suit. I have talked to 
enough vice-presidents and presidents of compu­
ter companies, publishing companies, networks, 
media outfits and so on, to be totally certain 
that they have no special knowledge or unusual 
basis of information; yet these people's remarks, 
as amplified through the business reporters, 
send the whole nation a-dithering. There are 
times I think everybody in Media is either deluded, 
misguided, lying or crazy. 
THREE CRUCIAL POINTS. 
1. SYSTEMS "IN THE HOME." 
The emphasis has changed from trying to 
sell snazzy systems to the schools (which don't 
have the money) to the home. This in turn 
has convinced most people that the new systems 
have to be very limited, like jimmied-up TV sets. 
(We easily lose track of the fact that you can 
have anything "in the home" if you want to pay 
for it; and an economy in which Marantzes and 
snowmobiles have caught on big indicates that 
some people are going to be willing to pay for 
really hot stuff.) 
2. CATCHING ON. 
The key question is not how good a system 
is in the abstract, but whether it will catch on. 
(Obviously if we're public-spirited we want the 
best systems to catch on, of course.) 
This matter of Catching On is a fickle and 
crucial business. 
According to one anecdote, Mr. Bell 
couldn't interest snyone in his invention, which 
he was showing at some trade fair. Then who 
should come by but the Emperor of Brazil (!), 
who was about to leave with his retinue of ad­
visers. "What is that?" asked the Emperor of 
Brazil. "Nothing to bother with," they said, and 
tried to rush him by, but he stopped and loved 
it, and ordered the first pair of telephones sold. 
This made the headlines, and the sale of tele­
phones began. 
Another anecdote. It is legendary that 
inventors overvalue their own work. Yet after 
Thomas Edison had invented the kinematograph, 
or "moving picture," a device you looked into 
turning a crank, he declined to build a projector 
for it, saying that the novelty would wear off. 
Obviously he did't quite see what "catching on" 
would mean here. Wonderful Systems That Were Gonna Be 
I once reud a mind-blowing review article in 
Films in Review, early sixties I think, 
on schemes to make three-dimensional 
movies before 1930. There were dozens. 
Then there was that multiscreen film Napoleon 
— a legend-- done in the nineteen-twenties. 
(That one really existed.) 
Phonevision, about 1947 or so, was going to 
store a half-hour movie on a 12-inch disk. 
Did they get the idea from the LP? Did 
they really think they could do it? 
The German photo-gizmo, around 1950: a special 
camera that supposedly created a sculpture 
of what it was pointed at. (But how did 
it know what was behind things?) 
A weird lens around 1950— I think it was depic­
ted as having a blue center and a red peri­
phery, like a fifties hoodlum tail-light— 
that was somehow going to find "residual 
traces" of color in black-and-white pictures, 
and make 'em into color, zowie, just by 
copying them. 
Then there was the Panacolor Cartridge. During 
the Days of Madness-- 1968, I think it was 
-- a rather good little movie gadget was 
being pushed by a firm called Panacolor. 
It had ten parallel movie and audio tracks, 
1 believe, on a 70mm strip. The prototypes 
were built by Zeiss. 
Their idea was that this was a com­
pact movie projector. 1 kept trying to per­
suade the company's president lhat they had 
inadvertently designed a splendid device 
for branching movies (see "Hyperfilms," 
p.°*77). 
Exercise for the reader: map out prop­
erties of the branching and expository 
structures implicit in such a device. (It's 
one-directional. Gotta rewind when you 
get to the end. But you can jump between 
tracks when it seems appropriate.) 
Anyway, it's gone now.

HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND WHATNOT (reprise) 
Among the many odd things that have 
resulted from the collision of computer people 
with educators, publishers and others has been 
the respectful imitation of computer ways by 
those who didn't quite understand them. Again, 
the cargo cult.* 
The most dismal of these practices has been 
the adoption of the term "software" for any intel­
lectual or artistic property This wholly loses 
the distinction, made on the other side of the book,

software (programs, detailed plans

In other words, hardware and software

this distinction entirely. Not realizing that their 
productions are the contents (material, matter,

they have mushed this together into a state of 
self-feeding confusion.

enough ljke computer programs to be called 
"software.")

Everything 
Else 3. STANDARDIZATION 
In order for something to Catch On, it has 
to be standardized. Unfortunately, there ia mo­
tivation for different companies to make their own 
little changes in order to restrict users to Its 
own products. The best example of how to 
avoid this: Philips patented its audio cartridge 
to the teeth, but then granted everybody free 
use of the patent provided they adhered to the 
exact standardization. The result has been the 
system's spectacular success, and Philips, rather 
than dominating a small market, has a share of 
a far larger market, and hence makes more 
money. That's a virtue-rewarded kind of story. 
The other problem with standardization, 
though, is that we tend to standardize too soon. 
We standardized on AM radio, even though FM 
would probably have been better. (One Major 
Armstrong, a great figure in the development 
of radio, committed suicide when nobody would 
accept FM. If he could only have heard our FM 
of today, he might have said "Oh, nuts," and 
lived.) 
Another example. When they designed the 
Touch-Tone phone pad, the Bell people evidently 
saw no reason to have it match the adding ma­
chine panel, so they put "1" in the upper left 
rather than the lower left. Now there are lots 
of people who use both arrangements, every day, 
and at least one of them curses the designers' 
lack of consideration. 
Another interesting example of Catching 
On: during the early sixties, it was fun being 
at places where they were just getting Xerox 
copiers for the first time. Everyone would ar­
gue that nobody needed a copier. Then, grud­
gingly, one would be ordered. The first month's 
use invariably would exceed the estimate for the 
first year, and go up and up from there. 
The worst aspect of the confusion among 
the corporations is that certain deficiencies and 
crudities of vision slip into the mix. Unless 
our new media and their exact ramifications and 
concomitants are planned with the greatest care, 
everybody stands to lose. We must understand the 
detailed properties of media. (The first question 
to ask, when somebody is showing you the 
Latest and Greatest, is: "What are the properties 
and qualities of the medium?" The followup 
questions come easily with experience: How of­
ten do you have to change it. what are the bran­
ching options, what part could somebody acci­
dentally put in backwards, are there distracting 
complications? etc. } 
I am unpersueded by McLuhan. His in­
sights are remarkable, yet suspicious: he_ sup­
poses that electronic media are all the same. How 
can this be? Here we may now decide what elec­
tronic media we want in the future— and this de­
cision, I would say, is one of the most important 
we have to face. 
The engineers seem to be quite the oppo­
site of McLuhan: somehow to them it's always a 
multiple-choice, multi-engineering problem, dif­
ferent every time; "this technique is good for A, 
that technique is good for B." But the net ef­
fect is the same: "electronic media are generally 
the same." I would claim that the're all differ­
ent, all ten million of them (TV being only one 
electronic medium out of the lot), and the dif­
ferences matter very very much, and only a few 
can catch on. So it matters very much which. 
Some are great, some are lousy, some are sub­
tly bad, having a locked-in information structure, 
built deep-down into the system. (Example: 
the fixed "query modes" built into some systems.) 
One last point. Everybody only has a 
24-hour day. Most people, if they increase con­
sumption of one medium (like magazines or books) 
will cut down on another (like TV). This dras­
tically reduces the sorts of growth some people 
have been expecting. Except, now, if we can 
begin to replace some of the inane paper-shuffling 
and paper-losing of the business world, and 
replace the creepy activities of the school (as now 
generally constituted) with a more golden use of 
time and mind. Read on. "The Emperor has no clothes on!1

In any medium-- written, visual, filaic 
or whatever-- you generate instantaneously 
an atmosphere, a patina, a miasma of style, 
involvement, personality (perhaps implicit) , 
outlook, portent. Consider—

are as nothing. 
«K\€J>Mf IK) THE ClrrfffcOPrvJ 
Time after time, the educational establishment has 
thought some great revolution would come through getting 
new kinds of equipment into the classroom. 
First it was movies. More recently it's been "audio­
visual" stuff, teaching machines, film loops and computer-
assisted instruction. 
In no cases have the enthusiasts for these systems 
seen how the equipment would fit into conventional edu­
cation— or, more likely, screw the teacher up. Teachers 
are embarrassed and flustered when they have to monkey 
with equipment in addition to everything else, and fitting 
the available canned materials into their lesson plans 
doesn't work out well, either. 
The only real possibilities for change lie in systems 
that will change the instructor's position from a manager 
to a helper. Many teachers will like this, many will not. 
when somebody shows you on electronic or other 
presentational system, device or whatever. 
A certain kind of slight-of-hand goes on. 
It's very easy to get fooled. They may show 
you one thing and persuade you you've seen 
another. 
And if you're canny enough to ask about 
1 feature you haven't seen they'll always say.

But the big companies were at first very conservative 
,„ their marketing, figuring television would be a luxury 
Item only It took a man named Madman Hunt*, who carica­
tured him.elf in a Napoleon hat. to see that million* would 
buy television if the price w.a right. So he came 
Hunt* TV in the late forties. A» I recall, the Hunt* TV 
cost $100 and hsd one tuning knob. (This wa. less intimi­
dating than the row of knoba on more expensive seta.) I 
L't know how Hunt, came out on it .11. but "is opening of 
the mas* market made the bigger corporation, realize it was 
there. (This same thing may yet happen again in newer 
media.) 
Originally all there was w.a Kr.zy Kat and Farmer 
Brovn cartoons. But behold, sooner than you could s.y 
"vertical hold," there were Sid Caesar and Inogene Coca 
cm the Admiral Show, and we were off. 
A quarter of « century later, the best of televiaion 
is no better and the bulk of television is about as bad 
a* It ever was. 
We "understand" television. That is. we know what a 
TV ahow la, how it fitB together and so on. 
ICECUBES 
But what people don't realize about TV is that the 
governing feature Is the time-slot. In any medium with 
time-slots, whether TV, radio or classroom education, the 
time-slot rules behavior. Whatever can happen is as con­
strained as icecubes in a tray. 
This is the limiting factor when optimists try to 
use TV for teaching. If it's coming over a cable, every­
thing has to be scheduled around It, and the contents are 
clipped and constrained to fit the time-slot. It may be 
better with videotape. 
CABLES 
In the last dozen years. Cable TV, or CATV, has 
become big business. A Video Cable Is a high-capacity 
electrical carrier that runs through a given neighbor­
hood or region. Business and individuals may "sub­
scribe" and get their own sets hooked onto the cable. 
What this does first of all is improve reception. 
The fouled-up video picture caused by such extraneous 
objects as the World Trade Center in New York can be 
corrected by hooking into the video cable: you get a 
nice, sharp picture. 
In addition, though, the cable offers extra channels. 
Now, the businessmen who have been throwing togeth­
er these video cable outfits are aiming for something. 
They have been thinking that these extra channels would 
net them a lot of money: by showing things on them that 
can't be offered on the air— highbrow drama, or perhaps 
X-rated stuff— they could get extra revenue. (You'd pay 
extra to watch it by buying an unscrambler, or whatever.) 
This is turning into somewhat i i disappointment. 
The cable people had foreseen, evidently, that people 
would stay home in droves to see the new offerings on the 
cable. In Show Business it's easy to forget, though, that 
everybody haa only twentyfour hours in a day, and far less 
than 24 hours to dispose of freely; so every leisure occu­
pation is competing with every other leisure occupation. 
Moreover, the residual leisure occupation, when there's no­
thing else to do, is TV. It would seem that few people 
would watch more television if it were better, but many 
would watch less if they could afford to go out. 
EXTRA CHANNELS 
In recent years, a number of extra channels have been 
made available by law. These are the UHF, or Ultra High 
Frequency channels. These, like cablea, represent a con­
sumer breakthrough but will have only negligible impact. 
THE PROBLEM OF ORGANIZATION 
Whatever else you may say about them, the networks 
and TV stations are at least organized as going concerns 
within the institutional structures of the country. Ideas 
of "community television" and other such schemes which call 
for some new form of social organization to spring forth 
are about as plausible aa "community control" of schools 
and police— or at best likely to be as influential as 
"community social centers." 
INTERACTIVE TV? 
Some people, I won't say who, have gotten a lot of 
money for something they call "Interactive television." 
What this turns out to mean is any form of computer time­
sharing that will use home TV terminals and video cables. 
The questions are why use home TV terminals and video 
cablea, insofar as they would seem to promise only com­
paratively low-grade performance; and whether these people 
have thought out anything about the potential characteria-
tics of the various media they propose with such abandon. 
Nothing I have seen or heard about this is reassuring. In recent years, many young folk* have taken to video 
AB a way of life. In the most extreme caeea they say things 
like "the written word is dead," prompted perhaps by McLuhan. 
I have found it rather difficult to talk to video freak.. 
(It may be that some of them are against spoken words as well.; 
I really Just don't know what they're about. 
In some cases, "alternative television" simply means docu­
mentaries outside the normal framework of ownership and report­
ing. In one example cited by Shamberg (see bibliography), 
video freaks did excellent coverage of the 1968 Republican conven 
tion. People were allowed to speak for themselves, unlike "nor­
mal" TV journalism where "commentators" tell you what they see. 
Now, this is hardly revolutionary] it is just good documen­
tary-making that shucks dumb traditions artistically, much like 
the Pennebaker films. However, video enthusiasts claim it i. 
somehow different, and indeed claim that video is different In 
principle from films. I have been unable to get a satisfactory 
clarification of this idea. 
Video is being used in other ways, harder to understand, by 
artists (best defined as persons called "artists" within the art 
world today). Very odd "video pieces" have been shown at art 
shows, where the object seems to be to confuse the viewer— or 
knock him into a condition of Enlarged Perspective, shall we say. 
And a variety of non-objective videotapes are now being created. 
(A gallery show in 1969 was called "Video as a Creative Medium" 
— implying sarcastically that it had not been before, on the 
airwaves.) 
Some video freaks think of video as intrinsically radical or 
Revolutionary. In this respect they differ Interestingly from, 
say, the editors of the National Lampoon• The editors of the 
National Lampoon appear to be political radicals, but do not sug­
gest that the very media of cartoon and joke-piece are themselves 
revolutionary. Some video freaks appear to be persuaded that the 
medium of television itself is inherently a vehicle for change. 
I can understand one interesting sense in which this may be 
true: Shamberg talks about video as a method of self-discovery. 
Seeing yourself on TV does, of course, confer certain insights. 
But Shamberg suggests it may expand people's consciousness in 
larger ways— allowing people to see the bleakness of certain 
pursuits (he uses the example of Shopping), for instance. But 
if this does hit home to people, it doesn't seem to me to be the 
medium that's doing it but the selected content— as in all pre­
vious media. Haybe I've missed the point in some way. 
These developments are all very interesting. It can be 
hoped that those trying to develop new forms of communication 
will make an effort to communicate better with those who, like 
the author, often cannot comprehend what they are doing. 
" But decentralized transmission of 
information should be dominant, not fugi­
tive. Each citizen of Media-America 
should guaranteed as a birthright access 
to the means of distribution of informa­
tion." 
(Shamberg, p. 67) 
" Well, we went down there with our 
Porta-Pak and tried to take it inside. 
A guard came over and said we couldn't 
and even threw one of us out of the booth 
while the other was inside. A guard 
telling you what to do in a cybernetic 
environment?" 
(Shamberg, p. 53) 
("Cybernetic" is evidently a code 
word here for what they think is 
good, true, beautiful and inevi­
table, cf. p. D/l 
About the only generalization to be 
made is that community video will be 
subversive to any group, bureaucracy, or 
individual which feels threatened by a 
coalescing of grassroots consciousness. 
Because not only does decentralized TV 
serve as an early warning system, it puts 
people in touch with one another about 
common grievances."

IN A B0TTL5! 
A cathode-ray tube is actually a bottle filled 
with a vacuum and some funny electrical equip­
ment. The equipment in the neck of the bottle 
shootB a beam of electrons toward the bottom of 
the bottle. 
This beam of electrons is called, more or less for 
historical reasons, a cathode ray. Think of it as 
a straw that can be wiggled in the bottle. 
Actually the bottle is shaped so as to have 
a large viewing area at the bottom (the screen), 
and this screen is coated with something that glows 
when electrons hit it. Such a chemical is called 
a phosphor. 
Now, two useful things < 
beam. be done with this 
1) It can be made brighter by increasing 
the voltage, which increases the 
number of electrons in the beam. 
2) The beam can be moved! That is, it 
can be made to play around the face 
of the tube the way you can slosh 
the stream of a garden hose back 
and forth on the lawn; or wiggle a 
straw in a coke bottle. The beam 
can be moved with either magnetism 
or static electricity. This is applied 
in the neck of the bottle— or even 
from outside the neck - by deflection 
plates, whose electrical pulsations 
determine the pattern the beam 
traces on the screen. (Note that the 
beam can be moved on the screen at 
great speed.) 
The vertical deflection plates can pull the 
beam up or down on the screen, controlled by 
a signal to them; 
the horizontal deflection plates can pull the beam 
sideways on the screen, controlled by a signal 
to them. 
JioetjCf-l 
By sending combined signals to both hori­
zontal and vertical deflection plates, we can make 
the end of the beam-- a bright dot on the screen, 
sometimes called a flying spot-- jump around in 
any pattern on the screen. A repeated pattern 
of the beam on the face of the CRT is called a 
raster. 
From these two capabilities— brightening 
and moving the beam-- a number of very special 
technologies emerge: 
TELEVISION uses a zig-zag scanning pat­
tern which repeats over and over. 
This zigzag pattern is always the 
same, night and day. 
If tit MIIT nuMDM^iT^ rv m\] we s>\x 
•'1 •ft* M-You can usually see the lines clearly 
on a black-and-white set. The pic­
ture consists of the changing pattern 
of brightness of this beam, which 
comes in over the airwaves as the 
television signal.

DM 7 
RADAR DISPLAY uses a CRT to show reflec­
ted images around where the radar 
antenna is standing. This uses a 
scanning raster of a star shape, 
brightening the beam when reflected 
images are received. 
COMPUTER CRT GRAPHICS generally use 
the CRT in still another way: the 
beam is moved around the screen in 
straight lines from point to point. 
(Between different parts of the pic­
ture the beam is darkened, turned 
very low so you don't see it.) 
Because the image on a normal 
CRT fades quickly, the computer must 
ordinarily draw the picture again and 
again and again. (Methods for this 
are discussed on p. pf\ 
SPECIAL KINDS OF CATHODE-RAY TUBES 
The CRT is not merely a single invention, 
but an entire family of inventions. The ordinary 
CRT, which we have discussed, is viewed at one 
end by a human being, has an image which fades 
quickly, and can have its flying spot driven in 
any kind of raster or pattern. 
Here are some other kinds of CRT: 
The picture transmitter, which has different 
versions and names: Vidicon, Image Orthicon, 
Plumbicon, etc. THIS IS THE MAGICAL DEVICE 
THAT MAKES THE TELEVISION CAMERA WORK, 
AND YET, BY GOSH, IT'S JUST ANOTHER CRT. 
Except instead of the picture coining into it as 
an electrical signal and out of it as an optical 
image, the picture comes into it as an optical 
image and goes out of it as an electrical signal. 
How can this be? 
The tube sits inside the television camera, 
which is an ordinary camera, like, with a lens 
projecting a picture through a dark chamber 
onto a sensitive surface. But instead of the 
surface being a film, the surface is the faceplate 
of a CRT with some kind of a special pickup 
phosphor: 
TV (WKV 
The electron beam, which is just like any 
other electron beam, is made to zigzag across 
the faceplate in a standard television raster. 
And the special phosphor of the tube measures 
the brightness of the picture at the spot the 
beam is hitting. I have no idea how this hap­
pens, but it's chemical and electronical and mys­
terious, and is baaed on the way the phosphor 
interacts with the light from one side and the 
electrons from the other side at the same time. 
Anyhow, a measurement signal comes out of the 
faceplate, indicating how bright the projected 
picture is in the very spot the electron beam ia 
now hitting. As the beam criss-crosses the faceplate in 
the zig-zag television raster, then, a continuously 
changing output signal from the faceplate shows 
the brightnesses all across the successive lines 
of the scan. 
And that is the television signal. Together 
with synchronizing information, it's what goes 
out over the airwaves, down your antenna and 
into your set. Your set, obeying the synchron­
izing information, brightens and darkens its own 
beam in proportion to the brightness of the 
individual teeny regions of the faceplate in the 
television camera. And this produces the scin­
tillating surface WP call television. 
The color tube is a weird beast indeed. 
There are several types, but we'll only talk 
about the simplest (and many think the best), 
Sony's Trinitron(TM) tube. 
This is an ordinary CRT which has, in­
stead of a uniform coating on the faceplate, tiny 
vertical stripes of three primary colors— red, 
blue and green. (You thought the primary col­
ors were red, blue and yellow, didn't you. If 
you're mixing pigments that happens to be true. 
For some ungodly reason, however, if you're 
mixing lights. the colors that yield all others 
turn out to be red, green and blue; it turns out 
that yellow light can be made out of red and 
green. If you don't believe me go to a chintzy 
hardware store, get a red and a green bulb, 
turn 'em on and see what happens in a white-
walled room.) 
At any rate, color television uses addi­
tional color signals, and in the Trinitron these 
control the response of the faceplate. If the 
color signal says "green" as the electron dot 
crosses a certain part of the screen, the color 
signal tells the green stripes that they're free 
to light up when hit. If it's Yellow Time, the 
signal tells both the red stripes and the green, 
and so side by side they light up red and green, 
as the beam crosses them, but the total effect 
from more than a few inches is Yellow. 
Most American color TV sets, however, at 
least up till this year, used something very dif­
ferent, something entirely weird called the 
Shadow Mask Tube. I'll spare you the picture, 
but there were several different electron beams 
-- often referred to jokingly as the "red electron 
beam," "blue electron beam" and "green electron 
beam," though of course they were identical in 
character. These hit a perforated sieve, up 
near the screen, called the shadow mask, and 
the color signal tweaked the unwanted beams 
so they did not hit different-colored phosphor 
dots that were intricately arranged on the screen. 
I'm sorry I started to explain this. 
Multigun tubes have more than one electron 
gun and more than one electron beam. They 
can be used in different ways (aside from the 
old shadow-mask TV tube, mentioned above). 
For instance, one gun can be driven in a 
video raster, to show television, while another 
gun can be used as a computer display, drawing 
individual lines with no regard to the TV pattern. The storage CRT cornea in two flavors: 
viewable and non-viewable. But what it does 
is very neat: it holds the picture on the screen. 
The mechanisms for this are of various types, 
and it's all weird and electronic, but the idea 
is that once something is put on the screen by 
the electron beam, it stays and stays. Up to 
several minutes, usually. The main manufac­
turers are Tektronix, Princeton Electronic Pro­
ducts, and Hughes Aircraft; each of these three 
has a product that worka by a different method. 
Note: Tektronix' tube is built into a num­
ber of different computer displays, and ia rec­
ognizable by its Kelly green surface. They 
themselves make complete computer terminals 
around thiB scope for $4000 and up, but lots of 
other people put it in their products also. It 
showB whatever has already been put on the 
screen, and the electron beam does not have to 
repeat the action. However, it usually only 
stays lit for about a minute. 
Princeton Electronic Products (guess where) 
is a much smaller outfit, so perhaps it is appro­
priate that they make a much smaller storage 
tube. It is about one inch square at its storage 
end, and you don't look at it directly. Instead, 
an image can be stored on it either wth a TV 
raster or by computer-driven line drawing. 
After the image is stored on it, though, it func­
tions as a TV camera: the picture stored on the 
plate can be read out with a scanning raster, 
exactly as if it were a picture transmitter in a 
television camera. The Princeton folks have 
built a quite expensive, but quite splendid, 
complete terminal around this device: it can hold 
both video and computer-drawn pictures, super­
imposed or combined, and sends them back out 
in standard black-and-white TV. $12000. 
CRTS which bring in a picture one way 
(such as a video raster) and send it back out 
another way (such as by letting a computer 
search out individual points) are called scan 
converters. 
A word about this last method. It is often 
desired by computer people to turn a picture 
into some form of data (see p.^fj)- Scan conver­
ters, usually by the three manufacturers named 
above, can be hooked up to let the computer pro­
gram poke around in the picture and measure the 
brightness of the picture in arbitrary places. 
A device which examines the brightness of some­
thing in arbitrary places is called a flying spot 
scanner.) Here are some different kinds of 
flying-spot scanners: 
t*-J More*, i^t-j-ls „f iprt ,K "U* 
1 have heard it said that it might be pos­
sible to build a CRT with a changeable mirror 
surface: that is, the screen becomes mirrored 
temporarily where it is being hit with the elec­
tron beam. Interesting. This would mean that 
you couid make computer displays (and TV) 
bright and projectable to any degree, say. by 
pouring a super-intensity laser beam on it. "Be 
great for writing 'Coca-Cola' on the moon," says 
a friend of mine. If you believe in astral pro­
jection .

Daniel J. Sandin (pronounced san-DEEN) haa 
•pent the last several yeara putting together a 
device he currently calls the IP (Image Proces­
sor). It's a aystem of circuits for changing 
and colorizing TV. What follows Is the first 
published description of it. 
I regret that the following is probably 
one of the most difficult sections of this book. 
(If you know nothing about video, read Hir..li|i|»'g-
-st.) oti f>- 7 
The Idea is basically to create a complete­
ly generalised system for altering the color and 
brightness of video Images. (I.e., the system 
does not move them on the screen. Thus It 
differs from the Computer Image line of video-
twisting graphics systems, which alter positions 
of objects; see p. DM $\ . Note also that 
rather similar facilities exist as part of, e.g., 
the Scanimate system, j. DM 31 •> 
This means that basically Sandln's system 
plays with the part of the TV signal called z, 
or brightness (as distinct from x or y, the sig­
nals for horizontal and vertical movement of the 
dot. )-
Now, as a physicist snd field-theoretician, 
Sandin approached thia aa a problem in generality; 
and Indeed, the style of generalization should be 
appreciated. Sandin repeatedly chose flexibility 
and power rather than obviousness in the parts he 
created. The resulting system is both parsimon­
ious and productive. 
His first important decision was that all 
parts of the system should be compatible and Idiot-
proof, so that any user could frivolously plug It 
together any way at all without burning out the 
circuits. 
Indeed, Sandin decided to build It like a music 
synthesizer: by making all systems electrically com­
patible (aa they are on the Moog and its progeny), 
any signal can be used to alter or influence any 
other signal. This is a very profound decision, 
whose far-flung results have not yet been fully ex­
plored even among Sandin'B rather fanatical stud­
ents. 
Basically, the incoming video image is "strip­
ped" of lta synchronizing information, so that all 
signals turning up in the guts of the machine may 
be freely modified. Only at the final output atage 
are the Jots and tittles of the video signal put back 
Thus the first and last blocks of the Image 
Processor act like bookends, between which the other 
modules have their fun. The first block makes the 
incoming signal into "naked" video, the last block 
dresses It up respectably again.

For the sake of clarity we will refer to the 
outputs as pictures, or aa black, white or grey, 
which they would be If they went straight out to a 
screen; but they may be turned back Into the system 
and function as Inputs as well. "White" means +.5 
volts, "black" means -.5 volts. 
Let us consider, then, Sandln's modules and what 
they do individually to the brightness signal z_.

that we really < 
Influential, and of uncl< of chose Modern Miracles 
get into. It is mind-blowing, 
importance. 
The channel A Inputs are added together and-mul­
tiplied by C; the channel B Inputs are added together 
and multiplied by the reverse of C; both results are 
added to make the output. (NOTE: this unit Is used 
among other things, for fades and keying.) 
2. COMPARATOR. Thla is like Kodalith film,mak-
Ing an Image Into stark black and white. Its output 
is pure black or white. One input signal (the video) 
Is compared with another input signal (reference level, 
other video, whatever). 
While one is greater the output goes all black, 
and while the other la greater it goes all white. 
3. VALUE SCRAMBLER. This is a single module 
dividing the picture into eight levels. It may be 
thought of as eight of the above comparators, divid­
ing the brightness spectrum by quantum jumps. The 
floor and celling of the aignal to be divided are 
specified by the two control channels, but the divid­
ing lines between them are then automatically deter­
mined. Each corresponding output level may be con­
trolled by a knob. Theoretically predicted by Dennis Cabor, the 
hologram (Creek "whole picture") was finally made 
to work in the late fifties by Lelth and Upatnleks. 
Since then dozens of other types of holograms have 
been experimented with, including color holograms, 
movie holograms, video holograms, audio holograms 
and gracious know what. 
Basically a hologram Is an all-around picture. 
It doesn't look like a picture, but looks like a 
smudged fingerprint or other mistake of some kind. 
It is

Thus from a range of Input values, we get an 
output atep-function each of whose brightnesses is in­
dividually adjustable. 
Note that these devices may be arranged in 
parallel, thus dividing the brightness spectrum into 
as many levels as desired. 
U. OSCILLATOR MODULE (very unusual). Sandln's 
oscillators are voltage controlled, just like the ones 
in music ayntheslzers. However, if given any kind of 
a eync signal, they lock into the nearest multiple 
(or submultiple) within the specified range. (But 
then the control signal,If any, tweaks it higher or 
lower.) Standardized output comes in sine, square and A basic hologram (— actually it should be 
called a laser hologram or Lelth-Upatnleks holo­
gram, but we've no time for auch distinctions—) 
is one of these smudgy pictures which, when viewed 
under a proper laser aetup,shows you a three-
dimensional picture. Worse than that: as you move 
your head, the picture changes correspondingly. 
It looks, not like the flat surface it Is, but like 
a lit-up box with a model in It. 
What does the hologram do? Actually it re­
creates, not a single view, but the entire tangle 
of light rays that are reflected from the real ob­
ject. Even down to bright reflections, which 
scintillate In the usual way, as from chromium. 
The only problem: ordinarily they have to be. 
used with laser light, which is spookily one-
colored . 
Notes from all over; art stylist Salvador Dali 
presided at an unveiling of "the world's first 360° 
hologram" at a New York gallery not long ago. The 
subject was song stylist Alice Cooper. 
The Haunted House at Disney World in Florida 
will ride you through a building full of holograms. 
That's one way to move through ghosts, all right, 
There is a New York School of Holography. 
.th. 6. FUNCTION GENERATOR. This device is hardest to 
explain. Let's do It in terms of that first module, the 
Adder-Multiplier. Know how the Adder-Multiplier puts out 
either a positive or a negative picture, depending on 
which input you select? 
The two planned uses were A) with a sync, to 
generate fixed patterns, and B) without a sync, to 
generate movable patterns. If both inputs are used, 
it becomes a stubborn lock-on voltage-controlled os­
cillator, which tends to grab at passing submultiples. 
5. DIFFERENTIATOR. Basically this sees edges in 
the picture, or any other part of a scan-line whose 
color is changing. Its output is proportional to 
change occurring in the brightness of a scan-line, 
As the input goes from black to white its output la 
light; aa the input goes from white to black its out­
put Is dark. (The input hole selected determines the 
amount of multiplication.) Well, the Function Generator divides the Input bright­
nesses Into three ranges, and multiplies each range posi­
tive or negative, in proportion to lta own knob setting. 
Thus the combined setting of the three knobs generat­
es a "function," or curve, from the slopes of the individ­
ual settings. See graph. What in photography ia called 
"solariration" represents Just one of these combined set­
tings. The others are nameless.

e such techniques. It turns out, 
they would be added to what Is

o5»J>Y E,iscwtixc£ 
"I eing the I l electric..." — Walt Whitman 
There are various people who want to at­
tach electronics to people's bodies and brains. 
There are basically two starting points 
for this ambition. One is authoritarian, the 
other is altruistic. I am not sure both schools 
are not equally dangerous, however. 
Let's consider first the authoritarians. 
Prof. Delgado of Yale has demonstrated that any 
creature's behavior can be controlled by jolts • 
to the brain. Delgado has dealt especially with 
the negative circuits of the brain, that is, 
places where an electrical impulse causes pain 
(or "negative reinforcement"). In Dclgado's 
most stunning demonstration, he stopped a char­
ging bull with just a teeny radio signal. En­
thusiastically Delgado tells us how fine this 
sort of thing would be for controlling Undesir­
able Human Behavior, too. 
Now, let's consider just what we're talking 
about. In these experiments, needles are im­
planted in the creature's brain. This can in­
volve removing a section of the skull, or it can 
be done merely by hammering a long hollow needle 
straight into the skull and thus the brain. 
The researcher, or whatever we want to call 
him, had better know what he is doing. But due 
to the remarkable mass action of the brain, the 
destruction caused by such needles will have not 
observable effects if done properly. 
The hollow needle, once in place, becomes a 
tube for shielded electrical wires, whose bare 
metallic tips may then be used to carry little 
electrical jolts, to whatever brain tissue is 
reached by the tip of the needle, whenever tiny 
signals are applied. 
Now there are regions of the brain, distri­
buted irregularly through its mysterious contents, 
which are loosely called the "pleasure" and 
"pain" systems. They are called that because of 
what the organism does when you jolt it in those 
places'. (We do not know whether jolts to these 
areas really cause pleasure or pain, because 
these things haven't been done to human beings. 
Yet. The creatures it has been done to can't 
tell us just how it feels; thus "pleasure" and 
"pain" are in quotation marks. For now.) 
Anyway, what happens is this. If you stim­
ulate a creature in the "pain" system it tends to 
stop what it is doing-- this is called negative 
reinforcement-- and if you stimulate it in the 
pleasure system, it tends to do more of what it 
was doing. Positive reinforcement. 
Now, to some people this suggests wonderful 
possibilities. 
Delgado, for instance, believes that this 
technology gives us everything we need for the 
control of Anti-Social Tendencies. Criminals, 
psychopaths and Bad Guys in general-- all can be 
effectively "cured" (i.e., put on their best be­
havior) by these techniques. All we have to do, 
heh heh, is get into their heads, heh heh, habits 
of proper behavior. And with these new techniques 
of reinforcement, we can really teach 'em. 
Unfortunately Delgado is probably right. 
In principle this is just a drastic form of 
behavior control on the B.F. Skinner model (depic­
ted also in Nineteen Eighty-Four and A Clockwork 
Orange) • The new system is more stark" and start-
lingT>ecause of its violation of the individual's 
body interior, but not in principle different. 
Skinner has the same naive, simpleminded sol­
utions for everything. All "we" have to do­
using "we" to mean society, the good guys good 
guys acting on behalf of society, etc.-- is con­
trol the behavior of the bad guys, and everything 
will be better, and "we" can accomplish anything 
"we" desire. 
The reader may see several problems with this. 
In the first place (and the last), there is 
the obvious question of who we are, and if we are 
going to control other people, who is goine-^ 
control us_. 
At a time when our "highest" leaders show 
. themselves preoccupied with low retaliations and 
lower initiatives, we can wonder indeed if it is 
not more important to prevent anyone from ever 
getting this kind of control over humans than to 
facilitate it. Even if th 
more simplemind' 
system would us 
of course, that 
laughably calle 
more laughably 
the sadists you 
(And no doubt s 
ments have demo 
people, turned 
adopt the patte 
time immemorial 
So, like truncheons and electric shock ther­
apy and solitary confinement and everything else, 
these techniques-- if they are used-- will enter 
the realm of Available Punishments, not to be used 
with clinical precision but with gratuitously bru­
talizing intent, new tools for punitivity and 
sadism. The "correctional" system would have to 
be magically corrected itself before such tools 
could be employed without simply making things 
worse. And the prospect is not good. 
Such schemes grow, of course, from a carica­
ture of the malefactor-- thinking him to be some 
sort of miswired circuit, rather than a human being 
caught up in anger, pain, humiliation and unem­
ployment. 
(There are also a lot of canards about Free 
Will, but these do nothing for either side in this 
controversy.) 
NEW FACULTIES 
Starting from an entirely different outlook, 
various designers and bio-engineers are trying 
to add things to the human body and nervous sys­
tem, for the voluntary benefit of the recipient. 
A number of research and development efforts 
are aimed at helping those with sensory impair­
ments , and electronics obviously is going to 
involved. 
An example: a firm called Listening, Inc. 
in Boston, founded by Wayne Batteau (whom John W. 
Campbell considered one of the Great Men of Our 
Time), devised a system for helping the totally 
deaf to hear. Supposedly this could transmit the 
actual sensation of hearing into the nervous sys­
tem by some scarcely-understood form of electri­
cal induction. The machine was sold off; whether 
it ever got a safety rating I don't know. 
This is the sort of thing people would like 
to do for the blind, as well. 
Now, in principle, it might be possible to 
transmit an image in some way to the actual vis­
ual area of the cerebral cortex. (This might or 
might not involve opening the skul1.) Somebody's 
working on it. 
In a related trend, numerous design groups 
are attempting to extend the capabilities of the 
human body, by means of things variously called 
possums, waldoes and telefactors. 
"Possums" (from Latin "I can") are devices 
to aid the handicapped in moving, grasping and 
controlling. Whatever motions the person can 
make are electronically transposed to whatever 
realm of control is needed, such as typewri ting 
or guiding a wheelchair. ("Waldo" is Heinlein's 
term for a possum that can be operated at a dis­
tance.) 
In the space program, though, they call them 
telefactors. A telefactor is a device which con-
verts or adapts body movements by magnification 
or remote mimicking. Unlike possums, they are 
meant to be operated by people with normal facul­
ties, but to provide, for example, superhuman 
strength: cradled in a larger telefactor body, a 
man can pick up immense loads, as the movements 
of his arms are converted to the movements of the 
greater robot arms. 
Telefactors can also work from far, far away. 
Thus a man sitting in a booth can control, with the 
movements of his own arms, the artificial arms of 
a robot vehicle on another planet. 
(This whole realm of sensory and motor mechan­
ics and transposition is an important aspect of 
what I call "Fantics," discussed on pf. J^ya-ft). 
Then there are those who, like How Wachspress 
(see nearby), want to expand man's senses beyond 
the ordinary, into new sensory realms, by hooking 
him to various electronics. 
THOUGHTS 
There are two problems in all of this. The 
first and worst, of course, is who controls and 
what w.,: hold them back from the most evil doings. 
Recent history, both at home and abroad, suggests 
the answers are discouraging. 
The second problem, wispish and theoretical 
next to that other, is whether in turning toward 
bizarre new pleasures and involvements, we will not 
lose track of all that is human. (Of course this 
is a question that is asked by somebody whenever 
anything at all changes. But that doesn't mean it 
is always inappropriate.) 
In the face both of potential evil and dehum-
aniration, though, we can wish there were some 
boundary, some good and conspicuous stopping place 
at which to say: no further, like the three-mile 
limit in international law of old. I personally 
think it should be the human skin. Perhaps that's 
old-fashioned, being long breached by the Pace­
maker. But what other lines can we draw? 
The prospects are horrorshow, me droogies.

I originally hadn't intended to include any­
thing like this in the book, wanting it to be a 
family-ntyle access catalog and all that, but this 
particular item seems fairly important. 
Remember how we laughed at the Organmo-
tron In Woody Allen's Sleeper? Well, it turns 
out not to be a Joke. 
An individual named How (not Howard) 
Wachspress, electronickcr-in-resldence at a San 
Francisco radio station, has been developing just 
that, except that he has more elevated purposes 
in mind. The secret was broken to the world 
in Qui magazine earlier this year; but Hefner, 
the publisher, evidently held back the more 
startling photographs of a model in electronically-
induced ecstasy. 
Wachspress* devices transpose sound (as 
audio signals) into feelings; you touch your 
body with an open-ended tube or other soft 
fixture attached to his device— which in turn 
is attached to a hi-fi. 
The sensations, it is claimed, are pro­
found and moving. You may take them anywhere 
on your body; the effect is deeply relaxing and 
emotionally engrossing. Wachspress thinks he 
has reached an entire neurological system that 
wasn't known before, much like OldB' discovery 
of the "pleasure center" in the brain; he sees it 
as a new modality of experience and a general­
ization of music and touch. That is the main 
point. "Hyper-reality" is where he says it gets 
you: a point curiously congruent with the author's 
own notions of hypertext and hypermedia as ex­
tensions of the mental life. 
This said, we can consider the prurient 
aspects of Wachspress' Auditac and Teletac devi­
ces (which he intends to market in a couple of 
years as hi-fi accessories, b'gosh). When 
played with the right audio, in the right places, 
and a good operator at the controls, they provide 
a sexual experience said to be of a high order. 
Wachspress' work ties in interestingly with 
today's "awareness" movement, of which Esalen 
is the spiritual center, which holds that we have 
gotten out of touch with our bodies, our feelings, 
our native perceptions. As such, the Wachspress 
machines may be an unfolding-mechanism for the 
unfeeling tightness of Modern Man-- as weU as 
a less profound treatment for "marital difficulties" 
and Why-Can't-Johnny-Come-Lately. 
Inscrutable San Francisco! Wachspress 
gave a number of demonstrations of his devices 
in Bay Area churches, until he became disturbed 
at immodest uses of the probe by female communi­
cants who had stood in line to try the machine. 
(Auditac, Ltd., Dept. CLB, 
1940 Washington St.. 
San Francisco CA 94109.) 
Harry Mendell, a good friend of mine, rigged an 
interesting experiment while he was still in high school. 
He used a little Hewlett-Packard minicomputer, which 
the manufacturer had generously loaned to his Knights of 
Columbus Computer Club of Haddonfield, N.J. 
Harry hooked the Hewlett-Packard up to a CRT display 
(see pp. imi,'7,bHtty • At toP of **** CRT' £°llowin9. 
his program, the computer continuously displayed the let­
ters of the alphabet. A little marker (called a cursor) 
would skip along underneath the letters, acting as a mar­
ker for each of them in turn. 
Harry rigged one more external device: a set of elec­
trodes. These would be strapped, harmlessly, to the head 
of a subject. Harry's computer program used these elec­
trodes to measure alpha rhythm, one of the mysterious 
pulses in the brain that come and go. 
Every time the subject flashed alpha, Harry's program 
would copy the letter above the cursor to the bottom of 
Sitting in this rig, subjects were able to learn, 
rather quickly, TO TYPE WORDS AND SENTENCES. Just by 
flashing alpha rhythm when the cursor was under the right 
letters. 
Jubilant, Harry showed this setup to an eminent neuro-
physiologist from a great university nearby, a man special­
izing in electrode hookups. Harry was a highschool student 
and did not understand about Professionalism. 
"What'B so great about that?" sniffed the eminent 
professional. "I can type faster." 
So Harry dropped that and went on to other stuff.

"Picture proceeding" ie an important technology, 
largely separate from the rest of computer graphics. 
It means taking an incoming picture, usually a photo-
;nd doing something to It. (Some now call this 
mputer pictorlcs. ) wis™. 
graph 
area ' 
First of all, there is Image enhancement. This 
means taking pictures, dividing them into points whose 
brightness is separately measured, and then using spec­
ial techniques for making the picture better- To 
people familiar with photography, this may seem Im­
possible; to photographers It Is a maxim that photographs 
always lose quality at each step. Nevertheless, various 
mathematical techniques such as Fourier Analysis (men­
tioned elsewhere) do just, that, producing a new data 
structure improving on the original data. Surfaces ap­
pear smoother, edges sharper. 
(These techniques have been extensively used to 
clean up photographs sent back from our unmanned space 
vehicles— both those used exploring other planets and 
those spying on our own— see Secret Sentries in Space, 
Bibliography.) 
Then there are recognizers— programs that look at 
the data structure from an Input picture, and try to 
discern the lines, corners and other features of the 
picture. (While your eye instantly sees these things, 
computers do not, and must look at the dots of a picture 
one-by-one. How to analyze pictures In such tedious se­
quences Is no simple matter.) 
For recognizing more complex objects in pictures— 
boxes, spheres, faces or whatever— more complex struc­
ture-analyzing programs are necessary. As the possibil­
ities of what might be in a picture Increase, these in­
creasingly become guessing programs. (This becomes a 
branch of artificial Intelligence, a misleading term for 
a curious field, dtscuaseT^np^Z-/'/.) 
Numerous computer people think it Is important to 
match up our computer graphic display systems (described 
Variously on this side of the book) to image Input sys­
tems. This ia a matter of taste. 
These are all basically techniques for making a 
data structure. Any data stored in computers must have, 
of course, a data structure— which basically means any 
arrangement of information you choose. (see p.26"f-) 
These various techniques are intended to create re­
duced data structures, recording only the "most impor­
tant" data of the picture— from which new and varying 
pictures may be created, reflecting the "true" structures 
originally shown in the initial picture. How much it's 
going to be possible to create these data structures 
from input pictures remains to be seen; some of us think 
it's not going to be generally worthwhile.

timtiii*rt«»F'lt-tVHninif.utnin.n-nvKtbttt'1 iirmuirf'.^rv Kenneth Knowlton is a Bell Labs lifer. 
Tall, patrician and gracious, his work, like 
Sutherland's, shows the inner light of unifying 
intelligence. He works in Max Mathews1 section 
of Bell Labs at Murray Hill, where they do all 
that interesting stuff with music and perceptual 
psychology and so on. During the last decade. 
Knowlton has turned out vast quantities of art­
icles, processed pictures, movies, and actual 
computer languages; while any ordinary man 
would be satisfied to be so productive, appar­
ently he does a lot of other things in his work 
that he doesn't talk about. 
Some of Knowlton's best-known work 
has been in picture processing, where he has 
converted photographs into mosaics of tiny 
patterns-- which nevertheless show the original. 
His first widely-known language was 
BEFLIX (BE11 Labs movie-making system); this 
was programmed for the 7094 in the early sixties. 
BEFLIX allowed the user to create motion pictures 
by a clever mosaic process that used the out­
put camera more efficiently . (Actually , the lens 
was thrown out of focus manually and the entire 
frame created as a mosaic of alphabetical charac­
ters; this did the whole thing much more quickly 
and inexpensively.) 
(Some of the clever data-handling tech­
niques of BEFLIX Knowlton then turned around 
and used in L*S, a language which made these 
techniques available to other computer people. 
This may sound like only a computer technicality, 
but it's the sort of thing that's widely appreciated. 
(L6 stands for "belL Labs' Lower-Level List 
Language.")) 
Wanting to get outside artists interested 
in BEFLIX and related media, he worked for a time 
with film-maker Stan Vanderbeek; from this 
Knowlton saw that artists' needs were more 
intricate than he had anticipated. Augmenting 
BEFLIX with some of the things Vanderbeek 
asked for, Knowlton came up with a new lan­
guage called TARPS (Two-Dimensional Alpha-
Numeric Raster Picture System). This in turn 
led to EXPLOR (EXJMicit(ly provided 2D Patterns.) 
Local (neighborhood) Operations, and Random-' 
ness). EXPLOR is fascinating because of its 
originality and generality-- not only does it 
modify pictures and serve as an artist's tool, 
but it has fascinating properties as a computer 
language and may even have applications in 
complex simulations for technical purposes. 
Since Vanderbeek, Knowlton has entered 
into a long and fruitful collaboration with Lillian 
Schwartz, a talented artist. Their many films 
have been clever, startling and powerful. I 
must say that they grow on you: I liked them at 
first, but when I saw five or six in a row this 
January, I found them just incredible. Because 
they are abstract, and full of fast-changing 
patterns and reversals, they take some adjusting 
to; but they're worth seeing over and over. 
EXPLOR may be thought of as a highly 
generalized version of Conway's game of Life 
(see p. )• You start with two-dimensional 
patterns as your data structure; these can be 
abstractions or even converted photographs, as 
in a recent Knowlton-Schwartz film showing 
Muybridge's Running Man. In your EXPLOR 
program, you may then cause the pattern to 
change by degrees, each cell of the pattern 
reacting to the cells around it or to random 
events as specified by the programmer. 
EXPLOR, running without external data, 
comes up with some extraordinary snakeskin and 
Jack Frost patterns. But its uses in traffic 
simulation and various other studies of popu­
lations in space could be very interesting. 
EXPLOR has obvious artistic applications. 
Lillian Schwartz is using it extensively in film­
making. It's now running on a minicomputer 
feeding to a modified Sony Trinitron color TV. 
(This color setup was created by Mike Noll 
and is described in a recent issue of the CACM, 
though only for black-and-white TV; the color 
is more recent. It stores the color picture as 
a list of sequential colors represented in the 
computer's core memory, each dot being repre-
Cf. "Boyell's Torrarium," p.flf\3& .) 
Knowlton has used EXPLOR for teaching 
computer art at the University of California; 
the language is available programmed in "medium 
size" Fortran from Harry Huskey, Dept. of 
Information and Computer Science, U. of Cal. 
at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California.

This ie a non-simple picture 
conversion. The original 
photograph was converted into 
measured points; but these 
were in turn made into grow-
together patterns by a 
program in the EXPLOR language. 
f£) Knowlton i Harmon. SPEECH BY COMPUTER 
You may have heard about various kinds of 
"talking computer." Thla deserves some explanation. 
Computers may be made to "talk" by various 
means. One Is through an output device that 
simply stores recordings of separate 
words or syllables, which the computer selects with 
appropriate timing. (Machines of this type have been 
sold by both IBM and Cognitronics for a long time.) 
A deeper approach is to have the computer synthe­
size speech from phonemes, or actually make the tones 
and noises of which speech is composed. These are 
very tricky matters. Bell Labs, and others, have been 
working on many of these approaches. 
The real problem, of course, is how to decide 
what to say. (This was discussed under Artificial 
Intelligence, p. fft'll/.) 
AUDIO ANALYSIS AND ENHANCEMENT 
The problem of analyzing audio is very like the 
problem of analyzing pictures (see p.jthlO), and indeed 
some of the same techniques are used. The audio goes 
into the computer as a stream of measurements, and 
the selfsame technique of Fourier Analysis is employed. 
This reduces the audio to a series of frequency measure­
ments over time— but, paradoxically, loses little of 
the fidelity. 
Wish there were room to talk about plain 
regular audio here— matters like "binaural" 
recording, and Why don't they make hi-fi systems 
based on a Grand Bus (see pM2 )? But there's 
no room here. 
AUDIO AND COMPUTERS 
People are occasionally still Btartled to 
hear that computers can make sound and music. 
They can indeed. 
First of all, note that an Incoming sound is 
a fluctuating voltage and can thus be turned into 
a data structure. I.e., a string of measurements. 
(Wloyt' - conveys!©*^ 
To make sound by computer is the obverse. If 
the computer can be set up to send out_ a string of 
measurements, these can be turned back into a fluct­
uating voltage, and thus make sounds. In the easiest case, the computer can just 
send back out the voltages it originally got In. 
This is rather ridiculous— using the computer 
just as a recording device— but it's a clear and 
simple example. 
The question after that is what next: how to 
make interesting streams''output 
., sounds and tones. " have the compute; 
measurements, 
There are numerous methods we can't go into. 
Max Mathews, at Bell Labs, has for years been doing 
music by computer; his current system is called 
GROOVE. Heinz von Foerster, at the University of 
Illinois (Urbana), has been doing the same. An­
other lab at MIT has just gotten a PDP-11/45 (see 
p. for the same purpose. 
(The problem is: can the computer keep up 
with the output rate needed to make music in real 
time? maybe the 11/45 can.) 
Another approach is to relieve the computer 
itself from making the tones, and use other de­
vices— music synthesizers— for this, controlled 
by the computer. This is essentially the approach 
taken with General Turtle's Music Box (see p. )> 
and at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Cen­
ter, where their RCA Mark II music synthesizer— an 
immense one-of-a-kind jobbie— is under more general 
computer control. 
/ J Kelt?. Once audio is reduced to Fourier patterns, it can 
be reconstituted in various ways: changed in timing and 
pitch independently, or enhanced by polishing techni­
ques like those used in image enhancement (see p-9f\i0 ). 
This has been done with great success by Tom Stock-
ham at the University of Utah, who has reprocessed old 
Caruso records into Improved fidelity. In the picture 
we see him with equipment of some sort and an old record.

MUSICAL NOTATION 
Note that the computer handling of musical 
notes, as symbols, Is another rask entirely, 
closely resembling computer text handling (mention­
ed variously in the book). A high-power structur­
ed-text system or Thinkertoy (se« p.flHftfl is flne 
tor staring and presenting written music. 
And, of course, such stored musical notation 
data structure) can obviously be played by University of Utah 
(Stockham has been in the news lately, as one of 
the panel puzzling over the notorious 18-Minute Gap.) 
(The author has proposed the name Kitchensynctra 
for a system to synchronize motion pictures with "wild" 
sound recording by these means.)

These are three topics of great importance; 
of Importance, unfortunately, less for what they 
have actually accomplished than for the degree 
to which they have confused and intimidated peo­
ple who want to understand what's going on. 
Merely lo mention them can be one-upmanship. 
All three titles mean so much, so many different 
specific things, as to mean almost nothing when 
lumped together as a whole. All three have de­
veloped a web of intricate technical facts (and 
sometimes theorems), but the applicability of 
these elegant findings is in all three cases a 
matter open to considerable scrutiny. 
Since each of these fields has developed 
a considerable body of technical doctrine, the 
reader might well ask: why aren't they on the 
other side of the book, the computer side? The 
answer is that they are computerman's dreams, 
dreams of considerable intricacy and persuas­
iveness, and wc are not considering the tech­
nicalities here anyway. As on the other side, 
the problem is to help you distinguish apples 
from oranges and which way is up. For more 
go elsewhere, but 1 hope this orientation will 
make sorting things out quicker for you. 
These three terms— "artificial intelligence," 
"information retrieval." "computer-assisted 
instruction"-- have a number of things in com­
mon. First, the names are so portentous and 
formidable. Second, if you read or hear any­
thing in these fields, chances are it will have 
an air of unfathomable technicality. Both strange 
technicalism and deep mathematics may combine 
to give you a sense that you can't understand 
any of it. This is wrong. The fact that there 
are obscure and Deep Teachings in each has no 
bearing on the general comprehensibiliry of what 
they are about. More importantly, the question 
of how applicable all the things these people 
have been doing is going to be is a question 
of considerable importance, especially when 
some of these people want to take something over. 
Don't get snowed. 
Each of these fascinating terms is actually 
a roof over a veritable 200 of different researchers, 
often of the most eccentric and interesting sort, 
each generally with his own dream of how his 
own research will be the breakthrough for 
humanity, or for something. It would take a 
Lemuel Gulliver to to show you the colorfulness 
and fascination of these fields; again, we just 
scratch the surface here. 
Another interesting thing these three fields 
nave in common: the frequent use of a classical 
computerman's putdown on anybody who dares 
question whether their super-ultimate goals can 
ever be achieved. 
The line is, "WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO 
THAT YET." 
ir somebody pulls it on you, the reply is 
\/ simply, "How do you know you ever will?" 
illustrating also certain problems of Artificial 
Intelligence. 
A very large artificial-intelligence system 
(goes the story) had been built for the military 
to help in long-range policy planning; financed 
by ARPA, with people from M.I.T., Stanford 
and so on. 
"The system is now ready to answer ques­
tions," said the spokesman for the project. 
A four-star general bit off the end of a 
cigar, looked whimsically at his comrades and 
said— 
"Ask the machine this: Will it be Peace 
or War?" 
The clerk-typist (Sp4) translated this 
into the query language and typed it in. 
The machine replied: 
YES 
"Yes what?" bellowed the general. 
The operator typed in the query. 
Came the answer: 
Yes SIR "Artificial Intelligence" Is at once the aexiest 
and most ominous term In the world. It chills and Im-
presses at the same time. In principle It means the 
simulation of processes of mind, by any means at all; 
but it generally turns out to be some form or another 
of computer simulation (see "Simulation," p. <T8 )• 
Actually, "artificial intelligence" has generally be­
come an all-inclusive term for systems that amaze, as­
tound, mystify, and do not operate according to prin­
ciples which can be easily explained. In a way, "arti­
ficial intelligence" is an ever-receding frontier: aa 
techniques become well-worked out and understood, their 
appearance of intelligence, to the sophisticated, con­
tinually recedes. It's like the ocean: however much 
you take out of it, it atlll stretches on— as limit­
less as before. 
Unfortunately laymen are so impressed by computers 
in general that they easily suppose computers can do 
anything involving information. And public understand­
ing Is not fostered by certain types of stupid demon­
stration. One year I heard from numerous people about 
how "they'd seen on TV about how computers write TV 
scripts"— what had actually been shown was a hokey en­
actment of how the computer could randomly decide whe­
ther the Bad Man gets shot or the Cood Guy gets shot— 
both outcomes dutifully enacted by guys In cowboy out­
fits. Duh. 
It should be perfectly obvious to anybody who's 
brushed even slightly with computers, however— for 
The Brush, see the other aide— that they just don't 
work like minds. But the analogy hangs around. (Ed­
mund C. Berkeley wrote a book in the forties, I believe, 
with the misleading title of Giant Brains, or Machines 
That Think. The Idea Is still around.) 
Here's a very simple example, though. Consider 
a maze drawn on a piece of paper. Just by looking, we 
cannot simultaneously comprehend all lta pathways; we 
have to poke around on It to figure out the solution. 
Computers are sort of like that, but more so. While our 
eyes can take in a simple picture, like a square, at 
once, the computer program must poke around in its data 
representation at length to see what we saw at 
1 The principle holds true in general. The human 
mind can do in a flash, all at once (or "in parallel") 
many things that must be tediously checked and tried 
by the highly sequential computer program. And the 
more we know about computers, the more impressive the 
human brain becomes. (The seeming cleverness of some 
simple programs does not prove the simplicity of the 
phenomena being imitated.) 
Nevertheless, It is interesting to try things 
with computers that are more like what the mind does; 
and that is mostly what artificial Intelligence is 
about. 
In various cases this has resulted In helpful / 
tricks that turn out to be useful elsewhere in the ( 
computer field. In this sense, artificial intelligence 
is aort of like menthol: a little may improve things j 
here and there. But (in my opinion), that does not 
mean a whole lot of it would make things better still. 
Nevertheless, some artificial-intelligence en­
thusiasts think there is no limit on what machines can 
do. They point out that, after all, the brain jLs a 
machine. But so Is the universe, presumably; and 
we're never going to build one of those, either. 
PATTERN RECOGNITION 
This is one of the most active areas in arti­
ficial Intelligence, perhaps because of Defense 
Department money. (It might be nice, goes the 
reasoning, to have guns that could recognize tanks, 
machines that could look over aerial reconnaissance 
pictures, radars that could recognize missiles...) What it boils down to Is the study of clues and 
guessing, among alternative. In some cases, well-
defined clue* can be found for recognizing specific 
things, like parts of pictures (even straight tines 
cannot be recognized by computer without a complex 
program) or like handwriting (see below). In the 
worse cases, though, careful study only raises the 
moat horrendous technical problems, and the pursuit 
of these technical problems la Its own field of 
study (articles have titles like "Sensitivity Para­
meters in the Adjustment of Discriminators," meaning 
It Sure Is Hard to Draw The Line). 
But In some felicitous esses, researchers ac­
tually boll a recognition problem down to 4 manage­
able system of clues. For lnatence, take the prob­
lem of written Input to computers. (Some people 
don't like to type and would rather write by hand 
on special input tablets.) But how can • program 
recognise the letters? Aha: the answer, kids, Is 
In your text. 
The Ledeen Character Recognizer (described in 
detail in Newman and Sproull, Principles of Inter­
active Computer Graphics, Appendix 8) is a method 
by which a program can look at a hand-drawn charac­
ter and try to recognize it. The program extracts 
a series of "properties" for the character and 
stores then in an array. Every character in a given 
person's block lettering will tend to have certain 
property scores. But the Ledeen recognizer must 
still be trained, that is, the average property 
scores of the letters that each Individual draws 
must be put into the system before that Individual's 
lettering can be recognized. Even then it's a ques­
tion of probability, rather than certainty, that 
a given character will be recognized.

(lit Tt.Hlr.) 
HEURISTICS (pronounced hewRIStics) 
If we want to make a computer do what we know 
perfectly well how to do ourselves, then all we do 
is write a program. 
Aha. But what if we want a computer to do 
something we do not know how to do ourselves? 
This Is called heuristics. 
What it amounts to basically is techniques for 
trying things out, checking the results, and continu­
ing to do more and more of what seems to work. 
Or 1 
isful 1 uld phrase it thla way: looking for 
ategles in whatever area we're dealing 
with. As a heuristic program tries things out, 
keeps various scores of how well it's doing— a sort 
self-congratulation— and makes adjustments in favor 
of what works best. 
Thus the Greenblatt Chess Program, mentioned un­
der "Chess," nearby, can "invent" chess strategies 
and "try them out"— what it actually does Is test 
specific patterns of movea for the overall goodness 
of their results (in terms of the usual positional 
advantages in chess), and discard the strategies that 
don't get anywhere. It does this by comparing Its 
"strategies" (possible move patterns) against the 
records of chess matches which are fed into It. 
(If you've read the other side of the book, 
heuristics may be thought of as a form of operations 
research (p. S"0 ) carried on by the computer itself.) 
In some ways heuristics is the most magical area 
of artificial intelligence: its results are the moat 
impressive to laymen. But, like so many of the compu 
er magics. It bolls down to technicalities which lose 
the romance to a certain extent.

SPEECH 
1. SENTENCE GENERATION 
The problem of computers speaking human languages— 
not to be confused with computer languages, pp. 15-25 and 
elsewhere— is incredibly complicated. Just because little 
human tykes start doing it effortlessly, it is easy to sup­
pose that it's a basically easy problem. 
Only since the mid-fifties has human language begun 
to be understood. That waa when Noam Chomsky discovered the 
inner structure of human languages: namely, that the long 
(and complex) sentence constructions of language are built 
out of certain exact operations. Previous linguists had 
sought to classify the sentence structures themselves; this 
led to complexities which Chomsky discovered were unneces­
sary. It is unnecessary to catalog sentence types them­
selves if we can simply isolate. Instead, the exact process­
es by which they are generated. 
These processes he called transformations (a term he 
borrowed from mathematics). All utterances are created from 
certain elementary pieces, called kernels, which are then 
chewed by transformations into surfai 
: The man lives in the 
combining transforma-
. Kernel: I go. final utterances. Examples of kei 
house. The house is white. Result of 
tlon: The man lives in the white housi 
Result of past-tense transformation: I I 
The moat important finding, now, is that the transfor­
mations are carried out In orderly sequences: any sentences 
can have more transformations carried out on it, all adher­
ing to the basic rules, resulting in the most complex sen­
tences of any language. 
Linguists since then have confirmed Chomsky's con­
jecture, and proceeded to work out the fundamental trans­
formations of major languages, including English. 
Now, one result of all this ia that It tuma out to 
be easier to generate sentences in a language than to un­
derstand then. Why? Because it Is comparatively easy to 
program computers to apply transformations to kernels, 
BUT very hard to take apart the result. A complex "sur­
face structure" may have numerous possible kernels— does 
"Time flies like an arrow" have the same structure as 
"Susie sings like a bird" or "Fruit files like an orange?" 
Result: to program a computer to generate speech— 
that la, Invent sentences about a data structure and type 
them out— is comparatively easy, but to have it recognize 
Incoming sentences, and break them up into their kernel 
meanings,is not. 
language-generating computer ays-
SENTENCE RECOGNITION 
Chomsky and others have discovered that seta of trans­
formation rules (or grammars, pralae be) vary considerably. 
It le possible to Invent languages whose surface structures 
are easy to take apart, or parse; auch languages are called 
context-free languages. (Moat computer languages, see other 
aide, are of this type.) Unfortunately natural languages, 
like Engllah and French and Navaho, are not context-free. 
It turns out that the human brain can pick apart language

GORDON PASi: 
Gordon Pask is one of the maddest mud 
scientists I have ever met, and also one of 
the nicest. An eloquent English leprechaun 
who dresses the Edwardian dandy, Pask sows 
awe wherever he goes, A forr,ier doctor and 
theatrical producer, Pask is one of the great 
international fast-talkers, conferenee-hopping 
round the p.lobe from Utah to Washington to 
his project at the Brooklyn Children's Museum. 
This spring, 1974, he has been at the Univer­
sity of Illinois at Chicago Circle, but soon 
he goes back to England and his laboratory. 
In a field full of brilliant eccentrics, 
Pask has no difficulty standing out. 
Pask is one of the Artificial Intelli­
gencers who is working on teaching by compu­
ter, about which more will be said; but the 
original core of his interest is perhaps the 
process of conceptualization and abstraction. 
Pask has done a good deal on the mathe­
matics of self-contemplating systems, that is, 
symbolic representations of what it means for 
a creature (or entity omega) to look at things, 
see that they are alike, and divine abstract 
conceptions of them. A crowning moment is 
when Omega beholds itself and recognizes the 
continuity and selfhood. (Pask says several 
others-- scholars from Argentina, Russia and 
elsewhere-- have hit on the same formulation.) 
Models and abstraction, then, arc what we 
may call the first half of Pask's work. 
Gordon Paak will be continued on p.Jhl7-3. SPEECH OUTPUT AS SOUND 
It Is possible In principle to set up computers to 
talk" by converting the language surface structures that 
their program come up with Into actual sound. See 
"Audio," p. DM 11 , 
4. SPEECH INPUT TO COMPUTERS BY ACTUAL SOUND 
So far we have been talking about the computer's mani­
pulation of language as an alphabetical coding or similar 
representation. To actually talk at a computer Is another 
kettle of flah. Thla means breaking down the sound Into 
phonemes and then breaking it into a data atructure which 
can be treated with the rulee of grammar— a whole nother 
difficult step. 
A few attempts have been made to market devices which 
would recognize limited speech and convert It to symbols to 
go Into the computer. One of them, which supposedly can 
distinguish among thirty or forty different spoken words, 
ia supposedly still on the market. Specific user* have to 
"train" it to the particulars of their voices. 
I repeatedly hear rumors of "dictation machines" which 
will type what you aay to them. If such things exist I have 
been unable to confirm It. 
(Everybody says that of course what we want la to be 
able to communicate with computers by speech. Speaking 
personally, I certainly don't. Explaining my punctuation

a computer, when it's easy enough to type it in.) tell It to 
5.- ALL TOGETHER NOW 
The complexity of problem should by now be clea 
CYBERNETICS 
Gordon Pask calls his field Cybernetics. 
The term "cybernetics" is heard a lot, and is 
one of those terms which, in the main, mankind 
would be better off without; although after 
talking to Pask I get the sense that there may 
be something to it after all. 
The term "cybernetics" was coined by Nor-
bert Wiener, the famously absent-minded math­
ematician who (according to legend) often 
failed to recognize his own children.' Wiener 
did pioneering work in a number of areas. A 
special concern of his was the study of things 
which are kept in control by corrective meas­
ures, or, as he called it, Feedback. The term 
"cybernetics" he made out of a Greek word 
for steersman, applying it to all processes 
which involve corrective control. It turns 
out that almost everything involves corrective 
control, so the term "cybernetics" spreads out 
as far and as thinly as you could possibly want 
(The public is under the general impression 
that "cybernetics" refers to computers, and 
the computer people should be called "cyber-
neticians." There seems to be nothing that 
can be done about this. See "cybercrud," 
p. g . This is an even worse term meaning 
"steering people into crud," specifically, 
putting things over on people using computers.) 
Properly, the core of "cybernetics1 seems 
to deal with control linkages, whether in 
automobiles, cockroaches or computers. How­
ever, people like Pask, von Foerster, Ashby 
(and so on) appear to extend the concept gen­
erally to the study of forms of behavior and 
adaptation considered in the abstract. The 
validity and fascination of this work, of 
course, is quite unrelated to what you call it. 
THE TURING MACHINE 
Is the most classical abstract Automaton. 
A Turing Machine, named after its discoverer, 
is a hypothetical device which has an Infin­
ite recording tape that It can move back and 
forth, and the ability to make decisions de­
pending on what's written there. 
Turing proceeded to point out that no | 
matter how fast you go step-by-step, you can t 
ever outrun certain restrictions built into 
all sequential processes as represented by 
the Turing Machine. This leys heavy limits 
on what can ever be done step-by-step by 
computer. (It means we have to look for 
non-step-by-step methods, which 
Artificial Intelligence is aboul tuch of

DO HI WANT TALKING FTSTEMS7 
I had one quite Irritating experience irfth a 
"conversational1 *y«tern,that la, computer program 
that was auppoaed to talk back to me. I waa sup­
posed to trP« to it In English and it waa supposedly 
going to type back to me In English. I found the ex­
perience thoroughly Irritating. My aide of the con­
versation, which I slncarely tried to keep simple, 
produced repeated spologles and confusion from the 
program. Tha guy who'd created the program kept ex­
plaining that the program would be Improvsd. so 
that eventually It could handle responses like mine. 
My reectlon was, and is. Who needs ltT 
Many people In the computer field seem to think 
we want to be sble to talk to computers and have them 
talk~"baek to us. This Is by oo means a settled matter 
:ated and require a CAM A COMPUTER PLAY CHESST 
: know what Talking programs are cempllci 
lot of space In the machine, and (more la 
require a lot of time by programmers who 
(I think) s>or* In lea* time by other meal 
talking programs produce in Irritating si 
paradox. In dealing with human beings, i 
we're dealing with, and can adjust what we say accord­
ingly; there Is no va* to tell, except by a lot of ex­
perimenting, what the principles are Inside a particu­
lar talking program; so that trying to adjust to it 
Is a strain and an Irritation. (Compsre: talking to s 
stranger who may or may not turn out to be your new boss.) 
Now, some programmers keep saying that eventually they 11 ^ 
have it acting just as smart aa a real person, so we needn I 
adjuat; but that's rldlculoua. We always adjust to real 
people. In other words, the human discomfort and Irrita­
tion of psyching the ayst' eliminated. 
Furthermore, on today's sequential equipment snd 
with feasible budgets, I personally think tha likelihood 
of making programs that are really general talkers Is a 
foolish goal. There are many simpler ways of telling 
computer systems what you want to tell them— light pen 
choice, for example. 
Moreover, having to type in whole English phrases 
can be irritating. (We can't even get into the problem 
of having the computer pick apart the audio if you talk 
it In.) 
This is not to say understandably restricted talking 
systems are bad. If you know and understand the sorts of 
response the system makes to what kinds of thing, then an 
English-like response is really a clear message. For in­
stance, the JOSS system (the first Quickie language-
see p. IS) had an eloquent message: 
eh? 
which actually meant, What you have Just typed in does not 
fit the rules of acceptable input for this ayatea. But It 
was short, it was quick, it was simple, and it was almost 
polite. 
Similarly, talking systems that use an exact vocabu­
lary, whose limits and abilities are known to the person, 
are okay. (Wlnograd, see Bibliography, has a nice example 
of telling a computer to stack blocks, where the system 
knows words like between, on, above and so on.) Where 
this is understood by the human, it can be a genuine con­
venience rather than a spurious one. 
(The problem of rudeness in computer dialogue haa not 
been nuch discussed. This is partly because many program­
mers are not fully aware of It, or, indeed, some are so 
skilled In certain aubtle forma of rudeness they wouldn't 
even know they weren't acceptable. The result is that cer­
tain types of putdown, poke, peremptorlness and importunacy 
can find their way into computer dialogue all too easily. 
Or, to put It another way: nobody like to be talked back to. 
Cf. Those stupid green THANK YOU lights on automatic toll 
booths.) 
Now, this la not to say that research in these areas 
is wrong, or even that researchers' hopes of aome break­
through In talking-systems is misguided. I am saying, 
basically, that talking systems cannot be taken for grant­
ed as the proper goal in computers to be used by people; 
that the problems of rudeness, and irritating the human 
uaer, are far greater than many of these researchers sup­
pose; and that there may be alternatives to thla potential­
ly eternal leprechaun-chaalng. 
If like the author you are bemused by the great 
difficulty of getting along with human beings, then the 
creation of extraneous belnga of Impenetrable character 
with vaguely human qualities can only alarm you, and 
the prospect of these additional crypto-entltles which 
Bust be fended and placated, clawing at ue from their 
niches at every turn, la both distasteful and alarming. 
Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts unfortunately 
tend to have a magician's outlook! to make clear how 
their things work would spoil the show. 
Thus, for a rather peculiar axt show held at New 
York's Jewish Museum in 1970, a group from MIT built a 
large device that stacked blocks under control of a 
minicomputer (Inter data brand). Now, the fact that it 
could stack and re-stack blocks with just a minicomputer 
wa* really quite an accomplishment, but this waa not 
explained. 
instead, the block-stacking mechanism was enclosed 
in a large glass pen, in which numerous gerblla— hoppy 
little rodents— were free to wander about. When a ger-
bil saw that a block was about to be stacked on him, he 
would sensibly move. 
Now, it is fairly humorous, and not cruel, to put 
gerbils into a block-stacking machine. But this was 
offered to the public as a device partaking of a far more 
global mission, the experimental interaction of living 
creatures and a dynamic self-improving environment, 
blah blah blah. 
Faasersby were awed, -why ore those animals in 
there?" one would say, and the more informed one would 
usually say, "It's some kind of scientific experiment." 
Mall, this is • twilight area, between science and 
whimsical hokum, but one cannot help wishing simple and 
humorous things could be presented with their simplicity 
and humor laid bare. 
I remember watching one gerbll who stood motionless 
on hie little kangaroo match*tick legs, watching the Great 
Greppier rearranging hi* world. Gerbils are somewhat in­
scrutable, but 1 had a sense that he was worshiping it. 
He did not move until tha block started coming down on top 
of him. ^ And tha answer is yei can a aet of procedures 
i what tha computer pro-
•et of procedures. 
, fairly well. 
•thing you Jot Now, a chess program ia not i 
down on the back of an envelope one afternoon. It's 
usually an isnense, convoluted thing that people have 
worked on for years. (Although I vaguely recell that 
second place In the 1670 lnter-computer chess contest 
was won by a program that occupied only 2000 locations 
In a 16-blt Minicomputer— in other words, a compact 
and tricky aneaker.) 
Now, simple games (like tlc-tac-toe and Him and 
even Cubic) can be worked out all the way: all alter­
natives can be examined by the program and the beat 
one found. Not so with chess. 
Chess basically involves, becauae of It* very 
many possibilities, a "combinatorial explosion" of 
alternatives (see p. 4) ); that Is, to look at "all" 
the possibilities of a midgame would take forever 
(perhaps literally— the Turing problem), and thua 
means must be found for discarding some possibilities. 
The structure of branching possibilities is a 
tree (see p. ); so that methods of "pruning" the 
tree turn out to be crucial. 
Basically there are two approaches to the design 
of chess programa. In one approach, the programmers 
look for specific threats and opportunities in the 
date structure representing the board, and try to find 
good strategies for selecting good moves on the basis 
of then. This is the approach taken in COK0, the 
"Cooper-Kor"chess program. The programmers selectively 
cope with individual problems and strategies as they 
turn out to be necessary. (This means that It la 
likely to have specific Achilles' heels; which, of 
course, the authors of the program keep trying to re­
pair by adding specific corrections.) 
A different approach Is taken by the Creenblatt 
chess program. This la basically a big Heuristic prog-
ran. It "learns" best strategies in chess by "watching" 
the game. That is, your pour historical chess matches 
through it, end it tries out strategies— making various 
tentative rules about what kinds of moves ate good, then 
scoring these moves according to the results of making 
them— as seen in positional advantages that resulted In 
actually championship play. 
Obviously this is a field In Itself, You won't get 
grants for it, but to those who really care about both 
chess and computers. It's the only thing to be doing. 
FRANKENSTEIN MEETS CYBERCRUD 
Fred Brooks, the keynote speaker at the IEEE com­
puter conference In Fall 74, seems to have said that 
HAL 9000 (the unctuous, traitorous Presence in the 
movie 2001) was the way computers should be. (Computer 
Decisions, Apr 74, 4.) 
I find it hard to believe that anybody could think 
that. Nevertheless, there are those artificial-Intelli­
gence freaks whose view it Is that the purpose of all 
this is eventually (a) to create servants that will read 
our minds and do our bidding, (b) servants who will take 
things over and will Implement human morality, regardless 
of our bidding (though we humans are tec frail to do so— 
as in Aslmov's 1, Robot); or even (c) create masters who 
will take everything over and run everything according to 
their own principles and the hell with us. (I met a man 
in a bar, after an ACM meeting, who claimed to believe 
thla was the purpose of it all: to create the master race 
that would replace us.) 
According to Arthur C. Clarke's retroactive novel 
2001: A Space Odyssey (Signet, 1968, 95t), the HAL 9000 
computer series began as follows: 
"In the 1980s, Minsky and Good had shown how neural 
networks could be Generated automatically-- self-
replicated-- in accordance witii any arbitrary 
learning pattern. Artificial brains could be grown 
by a process strikingly analogous to the development 
of the human brain." (P. 96.) 
I don't know who Good is, but these are among the lines 
Minsky has been working along for years, so I hope he's 
encouraged by the news of what he's going to accomplish. 
Anyhow, so okay they grow the UAL 9000 in a tank. 
Then how come in the Death-of-Hal scene we see Keir Dullea 
bobbing around loosening circuit cards, just as if it 
were a plain old 1978 computer? 
Possible answer »2. HAL's tanks of neural glop are 
controlled by PDP-lls, one to a card, 
(Of course, if you take the letters after H, A and L 
in the alphabet, you get I, B and M. So maybe those are 1130s.) THE THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS 
1-- A robot may not injure a human being-, or, 
through inaction, allow a human being to come 
to harm. 
1-- A robot must obey the orders given it by 
human beings except where such orders would 
conflict with the First Law. 
3 - A robot must protect its own existence as 
long as auch protection does not conflict with 
the First or Second Law.

DO COMPUTERS FRIGHTEN YOU? 
(quoted in Wlnograd, 74-5) 
The fascinating thing about the ELIZA program is 
that it seems so like a real person— that is, a psycho­
analyst of the nondirectlve, Carl Rogers school. 
But all it is is a bag of tricks. 
Then it spots certain types of sentences and turns 
them around. If the person types a sentence beginning with 
"I am...", the ELIZA program turns it around with HOW LONG 
HAVE YOUR BEEN... ? 
And it looks for specific words which indicate a sen­
tence can be turned around for a convincing result. For in­
stance, if the person uses the word "everyone," the program 
aimply replies, WHO IN PARTICULAR CAN YOU THINK OF? 
And certain highly-charged words are signals to throw in 
a zinger, regardless of what the user may have said. Por in­
stance, if the person uses the word "mother," the machine 
replies: 
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. 
Now, do not be fooled. There ia no Ghost in the 
Machine. The program does not "understand" the uaer. 
THE PROGRAM IS MERELY ACTING OUT THE BAG OF TRICKS THAT 
JOE WEIZENBAUH THOUGHT UP. Credit where credit i* duel

The thing is, many people refuse to believe that it's 
a program. Even when the program's tricks are explained. 
And even some who understand ELIZA like to call it up 
from their terminals for companionship, now and then.

"Infonutlon Retrieval" ia one of thoae terms 
that laymen throv around aa If It were a manhole 
cover. It aounda aa though It means BO much, so very" 
much. And ao you actually hear people say thlnga like) 
"But that would mean... (pregnant pouae) ... Informa­
tion Retrieval:.':" Similarly, some of the hokey new 
copyright notlcee you aee In booka from Wlth-It publiah-
era intone that eold books may not be "place* in any in­
formation retrieval ayatem..." I take thla to mean 
that the publiahera are forbidding you to put the book 
on a bookshelf, because "Information retrieval" simply 
means any way at all of getting beck Information from 
anything. A bookshelf, since it allows you to read the 
•pines of the books, ia Indeed an Information Retrieval 
System. 
It happens, incidentally, that the phrase "informa­
tion retrieval" was coined In the forties by Calvin Mooers, 
inventor of TRAC*" language (see pp. 18-21). (If Wiener 
had coined it he might have called it Getbsck. If Diebold 
had coined It It might have been Thoughtomation.) 
Anyhow, numerous entirely different things go 
1 field, all under the name of Information Retrieval. in 
non-computer j itrleval. (See Becker and Hayes 
Automatic Infon ition Retrieval-) These things are kind 
of old-fashioned fun— cards with holes punched along the 
edge, for Instance,that you sort with knitting needles, 
or the more recent systems with holes drilled in plastic 
cards. Trouble is, of course, that computers are becoming 
much more convenient and even less expensive than these, 
counting your own time as being worth something. 
2. Document Retries This basically is an apprc 
that glorifies the old library card file, except now the 
•tuff la stored In computers rather than on csrds. But 
what's stored is still the name of the document, who wrote 
It, where It was published and so on. Obviously helpful 
to librarians, but scarcely exciting. 
3. Automatic document Indexing. Some organizations 
find it helpful to have a computer try to figure out what 
a book la about, rather than have a person look at it and 
check. (I don't see why this eaves anything, but there you 
are.) Anyway, the text of the document (or selected parts) 
are poured through a computer program that selects, for in­
stance, keywords, that is, the most Important words in it, 
or rather words the program thinks are most important. Then 
these keywords can go on the headings of library file cards, 
or whatever. 
There are various related systems by which people 
study, for instance, the citations between articles, but 
we won't get into that. 
4. Content retrieval. How we're getting to the sexy 
stuff. A system for content retrieval ia one that somehow 
stores information in a computer and lets you get it back 
The trick c both ( i is of i 
Well, as we said on the other Bide of the book, any 
information stored in a computer has a data structure, 
which simply means whatever arrangement of alphabetical 
characters, numbers and special codes the computer happens 
to be saving. 
In a content-retrieval system. Information on some 
subject is somehow jammed into a data structure— possibly 
even by human coders— and then set up so people can get 
It back out again in some way. Lot of possibilities here, 
get It? 
In the most startling of these systems, the QAS, or 
"Question-Answering System," some aort of dialogue program 
(see "Artificial Intelligence," nearby) tries to give you 
i about the data structure. But this means there 
i whole lot of programs: have 1 Like Artificial Intelligence and Information Ret­

In the claaalc formulation of the early sixties, there 
were going to be three levels of CAI: "drill-and-practlce" 
systems, much like teaching machines, that almply helped 
atudents practice various skills; s middle level (often 
itself called, confusingly, "computer-assisted Instruction")' 
and a third level, the Socratlc system, which would supposedly 
be Ideal. Students studying on Socratlc systems would be 
eloquently and thoughtfully Instructed and corrected by a 
perfect being in the machine. "We don't know how to do that 
yet," the people keep saying. Yet. Indeed. 
(My personal view on this 
( f ol low lng) Is that Computer 
ways extends the worst featur 
into the new realm of present subject, expressed in an article 
-Assisted Instruction in many 
;s of education aa we now know it 
it ion by computer.) 
Then there Is the matter of consistency. The really 
interesting subjects are the ones where different authors 
claim opposing facts to support opposite conclusions. 
In other words, there is inconsistency within the content 
of the field. In this case such systems are going to have 
a problem. (See "Rasho-Mon Principle" under "Tissue of 
Thought," ff-jPS '*-<7 
Another fundamental point is this. It may be easy 
enough to program a system to answer the question, 
WHAT TIME DOES THE NEXT PLANE LEAVE FOR LACUARDIA7 
but it is a lot simpler to^dlsplay schedules your eye can 
run down, or allow you to go look at some kind of graphic 
display. 
Speaking personally, I don't like talking to machines 
and I don't like their talking back to me. I'm not saying

Did you find school dismal and dreary? 
Did it turn you off? 
Here the author proposes safe and legal 
ways to turn kids on. by Theodor H. Nelson 
The Nelson Organization 
New York 
Some think the educational system is basically 
all right, and more resources would get it working 
again. Schools would do things the same way. ex­
cept more so. and things would get better. 
In that case the obvious question would be. how 
can computers help? How can computers usefully 
supplement and extend the traditional and accept­
ed forms of teaching? This is the question to which 
present-day efforts in "computer-assisted instruc­
tion" — called CAI — seem to respond. 
But such an approach is of no possible interest 
to the new generation of critics of our school sys­
tem — people like John Holt (Why Children Fail), 
Jonathan Kozol {.Death at an Early Age) and 
James Herndon (The Way It Spozeil To Be). More 
and more, such people are severely questioning the 
general framework and structure of the way we 
teach. 
These writers describe particularly ghastly 
examples of our schooling conditions. But such 
horror stories aside, we are coming to recognize 
that schools as we know them appear designedPaJ^* 
every level to sabotage the supposed goals of edu­
cation. A child arrives at school bright and early 
in his life. By drabness we deprive him of interests. 
By fixed curriculum and sequence we rob him of 
his orientation, initiative and motivation, and by 
testing and scoring we subvert his natural intelli­
gence. 
Schools as we know them all run on the same 
principles: iron all subjects flat and then proceed, 
in groups, at a forced march across the flattened 
plain. Material is dumped on the students and their 
responses calibrated; their interaction and involve­
ment with the material is not encouraged nor taken 
into consideration, but their dutifulncss of response 
is carefully monitored. 
While an exact arrangement of intended motiva­
tions for the student is preset within the system, 
they do not usually take effect according to the 
ideal. It is not that students are unmotivated, but 
motivated askew. Rather than seek to achieve in 
the way they are supposed to. students turn to 
churlishness, surliness, or intellectual sheepishness. 
A general human motivation is god-given at the 
beginning and warped or destroyed by the edu­
cational process as we know it: thus we internalize 
at last that most fundamental of grownup goals: 
just to get through another day. 
Because of this procedure our very notion of 
human ability has suffered. Adult mentality is

An interesting point, incidentally, is that people road this » lot of different ways. 
One Dean of Education hilariously misread it as an across-the board plug for CAI. 
Others read in it various forms of menace or advocacy of generalized mechanization. 
One letter-writer said I was a menace but at least writing articles kept me off the 
streets. Here is my fundamental point: computer ass is ted instruction, applied thought­
lessly and imitativcly , threatens to extend the worst features of education as it is now .

IT cauterized, and we call it "normal." Most people's 
minds are mostly turned tiff most of the time. We 
know virtually nothing of human abilities except 
as they have been pickled and boxed in schools; we 
need to ignore all that and start fresh. To want stu­
dents to be "normal" is criminal, when we are all 
so far below our potential. Buckminster Fuller, in 
/ Seem To Be A Verb, says we are all born ge­
niuses: Sylvia Ashton-Warner tells us in Teacher 
of her success with this premise, and of the bril­
liance and creative potential she was able to find in 
all her schoolchildren. 
Curricula themselves destructively arrange the 
study situation. By walls between artificially segre­
gated "studies" and "separate topics" we forbid the 
pursuit of interest and kill motivation. 
In ordinary schooling, the victim cannot orient 
himself to the current topic except by understand-
ing the official angle of approach and presenta­
tion. Though tie-ins to previous interests and 
knowledge are usually the best way to get an initial 
sense of a thing, there is only time to consider the 
officially presented tie-ins. (Neither is there time 
to answer questions, except briefly and rarely well 
— and usually in a way that promotes "order" by 
discouraging "extraneous" tie-ins from coming up.) 
The unnecessary division and walling of sub­
jects, sequencing and kibbling of material lead peo­
ple to expect simplifications, to feel that naming a 
thing is understanding it, to fear complex wholes; 
to believe creativity means recombination, the 
parsing of old relations, rather than synthesis. 
Like political boundaries, curriculum boundar­
ies arise from noticeable features of a continuum 
and become progressively more fortified. As be­
hind political borders, social unification occurs 
within them, so that wholly dissimilar practitioners 
who share a name come to think they do the same 
thing. And because they talk mainly to each other, 
they forget how near is the other side of the border. 
Because of the fiction of "subjects," great con­
cern and consideration has always gone into cal­
culating the "correct" teaching sequence for each 
"subject." In recent years radical new teaching se­
quences have been introduced for teaching various 
subjects, including mathematics and physics. But 
such efforts appear to have been misinformed by 
the idea of supplanting the "wrong" teaching se­
quence with the "right" teaching sequence, one 
which is "validated." Similarly, we have gone from 
a time when the instructional sequence was a bal­
ance between tradition and the lowest common de­
nominator of each subject, to a time when teachers 
may pick "flexible optimized strategies" from text-If the computer is a universal control system,

Discrete hypertexts 
"Hypertext" means forms of writing which branch 
or perform on request; they are best presented on com­
puter display screens. 
In ordinary writing the author may break sequence 
for footnotes or insets, but the use of print on prpr 
makes some basic sequence essential. The compu. 
display screen, however, permits footnotes on footnotes 
on footnotes, and pathways of any structure the author 
wants to create. 
Discrete, or chunk style, hypertexts consist of sepa­
rate pieces of text connected by links. 
Ordinary prose appears on the screen and may be 
moved forward and back by throttle. An asterisk or 
other key in the text means, not an ordinary footnote, 
but a jump—to an entirely new presentation on the 
screen. Such jumpable interconnections become part 
of the writing, entering into the prose medium itself as 
a new way to provide explanations and details to the 
seeker. These links may be artfully arranged according 
to meanings or relations in the subject, and possible 
tangents in the reader's mind.

Performing hypcrgrams 
A hypergrum is a performing or branching picture; 
for instance, this angle, with the bar-graph of its re­
lated trigonometric functions. The student may turn 
the angle upon the screen, seizing it with the light-pen, 
and watch the related trigonometric functions, dis­
played as bar charts, change correspondingly. 
Hypergrams may also be programmed to show the 
consequences of a user's prod—what follows or ac­
companies some motion of the picture that he makes 
with a pointing tool, like the heartbeat sequence. 
Slrutdilcx&i.ls in Hit details 
This form of hypertext is easy to use without getting 
lost. As a form of writing, it has special advantages for 
discursive and loosely structured materials—for in­
stance historical narratives. There arc a screen and two throttles. The first 
throttle moves the text forward and backward, up and 
down on Ihe screen. The second throttle causes changes 
in Ihe writing itself: throttling toward you causes the 
texl to become hn^ - by minute degrees. Gaps appear 
between phrases; ne M words and phrases pop into the 
gaps, an item at a time. Push back on the Ihrotile and 
the writing becomes shorter and less detailed. 
The stretchtext is stored as a text stream with extras, 
coded to pop in and pop out at Ihe desired altitudes: 
Stretchtext is a form of writing. 
It is read from a screen. The user 
controls it with throttles. It yets 
longer and shorter on demand. 
Stretchtext, a kind of hypertext, 
is basically n form nf writing closely 
related to other prose. 11 is read by 
a user or student from a computer 
display screrm. The user, or student, 
controls it, and causes it to change, 
with throttles connected to the 
computer. Stretchtext yets longer, 
by adding words and phrases, or 
slim ter, by subtracting words and 
phrases, on demand. 
Hyper map zips up or down 
The screen is a map. A steering device permits the 
user to move the map around the world's surface; a 
throttle zooms it in. Not by discrete jumps, but ani­
mated in small changes, the map grows and grows in 
scale. More details appear as the magnifiealion in­
creases. The user may request additional display modes 
"overlays," such as population, climate, and indus-
Such additional features may pop into view on 
reqik try 
Queriable illustrations: a tor in 01 li>pcrgram 
A "hypergram" is a picture that can branch or per­
form on request. In this particular example, we see 
on the screen a line-drawing with protruding labels. 
When the student points at a label, it becomes a sliding 
descriptive ribbon, explaining the thing labelled. 
Or asterisks in an illustration may signal jumps lo 
detailed diagrams and explanations, as in discrete 
hypertexts. Dissection on the screen 
The student of anatomy may use his light-pen as a 
scalpel for a deceased creature on the screen. As he 
cuts, the tissue parts. He could also turn the light-pen 
into hemostal or forceps, and fully dissect the creature 
—or put it back together again. (This need not be a 
complex simulation. Many key relationships can be 
shown by means of fairly simple schematic pictures, 
needing a data structure not prohibitively complicated.) 
Hyper-comics arc tun 
Hyper-comics arc perhaps the simplest and most 
straightforward hyper-medium. Ihe screen holds a 
comic strip, but one which branches on the student's 
request. For instance, different characters could be used 
to explain things in different ways, with the student able 
to choose which type of explanation he wanted at a 
spec flic lime.

Proponents of CAI want us to believe that scientific 
teaching requires a certain setup and format, incom­
prehensible to the layman and to be left to experts. 
This is simply not true. "Technicality" is a myth. The 
problem is not one of technical Tightness, but what 
should be. 
The suggestions lhat have been given are things that 
should be; they will be brought about. •

It was explained on the other side that 
computers have no fixed purpose or style of 
operation, but can be set in motion on detailed 
and repetitive tasks in any realm of human in­
terest-- as long as those tasks are exactly 
specifiable in certain humdrum ways. 
Now, if you had a machine like that 
burning a hole in the comer of your office, 
what would you really want to do with it? 
You can't drive it on the road. 
Vou can't make love to it, (But see p.**.) 
You can't cook in it, or get the news 
on it. 
To get it to control elaborate events in 
the real world requires a lot of expensive equip­
ment and interfaces, so cross that out. 
Yet suppose you have an inquiring imag­
ination-- which is not unlikely, considering 
that you are reading this sentence. 
And we are also supposing (from an ear­
lier paragraph) that you have a computer. 
What sorts of thing would you do with it? 
Things that are imaginative and don't 
require too much else.

and if thla idea doesn't turn you on, 
tha rate of this book is probably not for you. The techniques of making pictures by 
computer are called computer graphics. 
But that includes the dull kinds of making 
pictures by computer, the ones that do it with 
pens and printing machines. 
The techniques of making computers 
present things interactively on screens is called 
computer display. (Some say "interactive com­
puter graphics;" this is not just too long, but 
too restrictive as well: interactive text systems 
are not "graphic" or pictorial, but they are going 
to be a profoundly important area of computer 
display.) 
(Incidentally, the silly word "interaction" 
was coined becnuse the previous word "inter­
course." which meant exactly the same thing, 
had racy connotations for Borne people. Cf. 
"donkey" and "rooster," also relatively recent.) 
You will note that computer display is 
what makes possible the computer terminals with 
screens that we saw on the other side. All 
that a screen-terminal is is some sort of com­
puter display, to which a keyboard has been 
added. You will therefore see that to understand 
all the different computer diaplay terminals, 
you would have to understand all the different 
computer display techniques; unfortunately 
we can only cover a few here, and those but 
sparely. 
Some of the types of computer displny to 
be covered hereabouts include: 
CRT, or cathode-ray tube, displays; 
these are my favorite because the 
stuff on their screens may be 
animated by the computer. 
video displays, which use television 
techniques. These have troubles 
deriving from the way a TV picture 
is timed. 
panel displays, i.e., those which appear 
on a flat panel. TheBe are going 
to be cropping up all over. (The 
pictures can't move much, but the 
devices are going to be cheap. 
Flat, too. Some people think that's 
very important.) 
3-D displays, especially of the CRT type. 
NOTE: this term refers ambiguously 
to two different things: setups which 
present flat views of three-dimennional 
scenes, and those which present 
stereoscopic views of 3D scenes; 
these are much rarer. 
image synthesis or" halftone techniques 
and systems. These are computer 
programs and special devices which 
make shaded or photograph-like 
pictures. (This happens to be a 
favorite topic of mine, and so there's 
quite a bit on it here, a lot of which 
is not widely known in the field.)

Some computer displays have to be deeply 
attached to • computer and some don't. These 
latter we call display terminals• 
A display terminal is like an ordinary 
computer terminal (see p If): that is, funda­
mentally a device by which a computer and a 
person can type at each other. However, dis­
play torminals have screens. 
Now, some display terminals only show 
text, just like ordinary printing terminals 
("described on the other side). But manufac­
turers are free to add any other features, and 
so different manufacturers make it possible to 
do various kinds of picture-making with their 
particular display terminals, i_f appropriate 
programs are running in the computer that con­
trols them. 
Some devices are sold as display terminals 
but actually, to further confuse the issue, 
contain complete minicomputers. (The fact 
that the manufacturer may not stress this is 
simply a marketing angle he has chosen.) Simi­
larly, certain terminals contain microprocessors 
(see p. iH ), which means they can be programmed 
to behave like various other terminals, but ordi­
narily they cannot be programmed to do much else 
by themselves. 
Without getting into it deeply, there are two main 
types of display terminal: those that are refreshed and 
those that are not. A refreshed display is one whose 
viewing surface fades and must be continually re-filled; 
a non-refreshed display somehow stores the presentation 
in the viewing surface itself. 
Non-refreshed displays simply take the symbols 
from the computer, blam them onto the screen, and that's 
it until the screen is erased (by cither the computer or 
the user).

If you have not seen interactive computer

Except for a few people who can imagine it--
and I ra trying to help you with that as hard as I

Most refreshed displays use an actual television 
screen-- that is, a CRT (see p.b^t-7) whose entire area 
is repeatedly re-painted by the elctron beam. 
Since computers send text out to terminals as in­
dividual alphabetic and punctuation codes, each terminal 
must contain circuitry to change the character code to a 
visible alphabetical character on the screen. Such a 
piece of circuitry is called a character generator. Ther> 
Display terminals generally have a little marker, or 
cursor, that the user or the computer can move around the 
screen. The computer can sense what the user is pointing 
at by the motion codes it gets, telling where the user has 
moved the cursor. 
I had intended here to print a little directory of 
display terminal manufacturers, but there simply is not 
time. See section on terminals, other side. 
Note that the term video terminal is often used, in­
correctly, for any display terminal. The term "video" 
should only be used when the screen is refreshed by an 
actual video raster. (See "Lightning in a Dottle," p.J>»,£-f.) 
Text terminals (also called alphabetic terminals, 
character terminals or keyscopes) simply show written text, 
put in either by the computer or the user. (Some terminals, 
called transaction terminals, can be divided up into specific 
areas that the user may and may not type into-- for banking 
and stuff. However, whether that form of terminal is 
necessary may also be a matter of taste in the program 
design.) 
Text terminals range in price from, say, 51500 on up 
to $6500. (This last is the price of a remarkable color 
text terminal demonstrated by Tec, Inc., at the 1974 National 
Computer Conference. Each alphabetic position could con­
tain a letter and/or a bright color; altogether the screen 
could hold big colorful pictures made up of these bright 
spaces. Ostensibly just a text terminal, actually the de­
vice could be regarded as an Instant Movie Generator for 
television animation. But it may take Tec, Inc. awhile to 
realize what they have created.) 
Graphic terminals offer some kind of pictures on their 
screens. These come in a great variety: line-drawing, some 
without, some with levels of grey. Of interest to the be­
ginner are: 
"The Tektronix." (Also called "the greenie," or 
"the green screen.") Tektronix, Inc., makes a 
display based on a pale green storage tube they 
make. (So does Computer Displays, Inc.) Such 
displays allow you to put more and more text and 
pictures on a screen, crowding it all up-- but 
you can't take the lines or words off individually. 
"The PEP." Excellent (but very expensive) display 
that comes out to a video screen from a high-re­
solution storage tube. Permits grey scales and 
selective erase. Princeton Electronic Products.

ing unit; somewhat less than $10,000.

puter interfaces and software. "Less than J5000"

REFRESHED HIGH-RESOLUTION COLOR SYSTEMS. A number of 
companies manufacture computer displays allowing com­
plex grey-scale pictures, including color. They are 
expensive but very very nice. Indeed, if you buy them 
in clusters, these fancy-picture scopes can cost as 
little as text terminals. Some manufacturers are:

Ihe tone of thia publication, so 1 want to stress 
It here. 
Making pictures with the GS 
halftone system (see pp. DM 32-9). 
The thing about display screens-- especial­
ly the high-performance, subroutining kind--
is that the screen can become a place from 
which to control events in the outside world. 
Example: I believe a (own in N.Y. State 
haa Its electrical system hooked up to an ID1IOM 
subroutining display (made by Information Dis­
plays, Inc., and coupled to a Varian 620 mini­
computer). Instead of having a wall with a big 
painted map having switches set into it. like 
many such control centers, the switches are 
linked directly to the minicomputer, and a pro­
gram in the minicomputer connects these circuits 
to the pictures on the screen. Thus to throw 
a switch in the real world, the operator points 
with his lightpen at the picture of the a witch, 
and the minicomputer throws the switch. 
There are oil refineries that work the 
same way. The operator can control flows 
among pipes and tanks by pointing at their 
pictures. or at symbols connected with them, 
and bingo, it happens Out There. 
In another caae, a person designing some­
thing at a screen can look across the room and 
see a machine producing what he just finished 
designing a few minutes ago. I wish I could 
say more about that particular setup. 
The true problem lhat I think is emerging, 
though, is the problem of system response and 
style. Okay, so you're controlling widget 
assembly, or traffic light grids, at the CRT 
screen. The real question is, how does the 
screen behave and respond? This is not, darn 
it, a technical issue. It's psychological and 
then some. The design of screen activities 
which wiU enjoyably focus the user's mind on 
his proper concerns-- no matter how personal 
these may be-- is the new frontier of design, 
of art, and of architecture. But more of that 
later. 
Now, the Xerox Corporation has said that 
they intend to replace paper (or. the way I 
heard it, "Somebody is going to replace paper 
with screens, and it will be either IBM or us, 
so let's have it be us."J 
Well and good. Save the trees and stem 
the grey menace. But the question is: what 
will the systems be like? How should they per­
form? What forms will information take? What 
conventions, structures, diagrams, animations, 
ways to sign things, ways to view things ... 
HOW SHALL IT BE? 
I am afraid that as long as people are be­
fuddled with technicalities, or confused by those 
who profess that these considerations are their 
specialty by right, we will never get straight. 
Lacking time for the full discussion, I give you 
a motto: 
IF THE BUTTON IS NOT SHAPED LIKE THE THOUGHT, 
THE THOUGHT WILL END UP SHAPED LIKE THE BUTTON. 
SAVING ENERGY WITH COMPUTER DISPLAY 
A timely criticism of computer display is 
that it needs electricity. But (as mentioned 
elsewhere) it saves paper, and, importantly, it 
bodes to save energy as well. 
IF WE SWITCH TO COMPUTER SCREENS FROM 
PAPER, PEOPLE WON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH. 
Instead of commuting to offices in the center 
of town, people can set up their offices in 
the suburbs, and share the documentary struc­
ture of the work situation through the screens. 
This view has been propounded, indeed, by 
Peter Goldmark, former director of """^J^ CBS Labs, the man who brought you the LP record.

YOUR BASIC TYPES OF COMPUTER DISPLAY 
(Note: the term "display" is also used 
in this field to refer to numbers and letters 
that can be made to light up in fixed positions, 
like on your pocket calculators. Those will 
not be discussed here. If you're interested 
see an article on the subject by Alan Sobel, 
Scientific American, early 1973 sometime.) 
THE FORKED LIGHTNING 1. EARLIEST SYSTEM: A LITTLE PROGRAM 
TO MAKE DOTS 
The earliest setup connected a CRT to a 
computer by the simplest possible means, and 
made its pictures with dots on the screen— a 
sort of tattooing process. 
It was simple because all the computer 
did was furnish to the connecting circuitry (or 
interface) symbols specifying how far up, and 
how far across the screen, the next dot should 
be. These symbols were actually coded numbers, 
and the interface turned them into voltages which 
then moved the beam correspondingly. (This 
process of making a measured voltage out of a 
coded numerical symbol is called digital-to-analog 
conversion • since (as explained on the other side) 
the main meaning of "analog" these deyB is "in 
a measured voltage.") 
Now, this has several drawbacks. One is 
that the lines are dotty; nobody likes that. A 
more important annoyance, though, is that the 
computer scarcely has time for anything else. 
Here is a flowchart of what the computer has to 
do in its program. (Even if you didn't look at 
the other side of the book, flowcharts are nothing 
scary. They're just maps of what happens.) 2. LINE-DRAWING HARDWARE 
The next atep in design is to get the com­
puter program out of the business of drawing 
lineB by a succession of dots. So we build a 
piece of hardware that the computer program may 
simply instruct to draw a line. As an interface, 
it looks to the computer like four separate 
devices: registers that tell where on the screen 
the line must start ("first X" and "first Y") and 
registers that tell it where to stop ("end X" and 
"end Y"), 
" Because their words have 
forked no lightning they 
Do not go gentle into that good night." 
— Dylan Thomas 
The most basic, and yet eventually the 
most versatile, computer display is that of the 
CRT. or bottled lightning (as I like to call it). 
It is, you know: a beam of electrons, just like 
lightning in a storm, but from the neck of a 
very empty bottle to its flat bottom, whose 
chemically coated surface we watch. As manip­
ulated by the computer, the CRT stabs its beam 
to all corners of the faceplate: forked lightning. 
Computer display began in the late forties. 
Computers themselves were completely new, 
and so was Mr. Dumont's magical Cathode Ray 
Tube or CRT (see p.'%). developed on a 
crash basis during the war so we could have 
radar, and as long as it was around after the 
war, we got television. 
But the lightning bottle, or CRT, can be 
used in a variety of ways. Its control plates, 
which move the ray of electrons around on the 
screen, can be given various different elec­
tronic signals, causing the beam to move around 
in different patterns. In normal video, the 
signals move the beam in a zigzag pattern, 
where the zigs are very close together and the 
zags are invisible; the carpet of zigs covers 
the screen over and over in a repetitive pattern, 
and the beam's changing intensity paints the 
picture. 
But we can drive the CRT differently, 
by using different control signals. For instance: 
we can apply a measured voltage to the height 
or "Y" plates of the CRT, moving the beam 
to a given vertical position, and another meas­
ured voltage to the sideways or "X" plates, 
controlling its horizontal position.

Furthermore, and here was the indignity 
of it, this system took far too long. To draw 
a line with thirty dots in it took thirty times 
around the loop in the flowchart, and since each 
box in the flowchart takes at least one of the 
machine's rock-bottom instructions-- usually 
more-- then the main loop of this display routine 
takes four separate operations per dot, or 120 
operations for a stupid 30-dot line. Plainly 
there has to be a better way to use an expensive 
computer. 
Actually it wasn't just the ignominy of it, 
but the fact that it took so long, that made this 
a poor method. The amount of stuff the compu­
ter could draw in l/40th of a second— and this 
turns out to be how fast the whole picture has 
to be made-- was too little. After l/40th of a 
second the human eye can see the lines on the 
CRT start to fade, and so the picture has to be 
redrawn to make it bright again before that 
happens. If your eye sees the picture fading, 
then when the computer draws the picture again 
you will see it get suddenly bright again-- and 
it will start to flicker. This is distracting, un­
healthy, and disagreeable. 
Note that the most important computer in 
the hi^tgry of computer display used this tech­
nique1^ This was the TX-2 at Lincoln Labora­
tories, a highly-guarded installation outside Bos­
ton which is formally part of MIT. The TX-2 
was one of the first transistorized computers--
perhaps the first; and on it were programmed a 
number of milestone systems, including Suther­
land's Sketchpad, Johnson's Sketchpad IV, and 
Baecker's GENESYS animation system (discussed 
somewhere). This speeds things up considerably, and 
allows the computer program to display on the 
CRT simply by telling the device what lines it 
wants drawn. Moreover, the program is free 
to do other things while each line is being 
drawn, though this involves the problem of how 
the program is to know when it's time to send 
out another line-- and we needn't go into that 
here. 
(Incidentally, it is a puzzling fact that 
such a device is available nowhere, although 
lots of people end up building one for themselves. 
There was such a thing on the market a couple 
of years ago-- line-drawing hardware with no 
interface and no CRT— but it was withdrawn 
because of reliability problems. A just price, 
if anybody wants to go into that, would be five 
hundred to a thousand dolars— this year.) 
3. EVOLUTION FROM THIS: TWO OPTIONS 
There are basically two ways to go from 
this basic starting point. Either we can keep 
the display device intimately and integrally con­
nected to the computer, or we can say the hell 
with it and cut the display device loose as a 
separate entity. 
Ivan Sutherland has cannily noted that 
there is a certain trap involved in these designs: 
as we build additional "independent" structures 
to take the burden of display away from the 
computer, we are tempted to keep adding fea­
tures which make the "independent" structure a 
computer in its own right. This paradoxical 
temptation Sutherland calls "the great wheel of 
Karma" of computer display architecture. 
It is tempting to cut the display loose from 
the computer. It means the computer can be 
fully occupied with other matters than refreshing 
the screen— preparing the next displays, per­
haps. Many computer people believe this is the 
right way to do it, and it is certainly one valid 
approach. But unfortunately it also drastically 
reduces the immediacy of the system's reaction, 
making interaction with the system less intimate 
and wonderful. 
Approaches which put display refreshment 
and maintenance in a separate device are less 
interesting to me, and so that discussion contin­
ues separately nearby . ("btfiv^^*"**^* f- J*12l).

4. THE SECOND PROGRAM FOLLOWER 
On the other Bide of the book. 1 explained 
that a computer ia basically a sippy device, 
never mind how constructed, which follows a 
program somehow stored symbolically In a core 
memory. Such a device we call here a program 
follower. While programs may be in many com­
puter languages-- all of them contrived systems 
for expressing the user's wishes, in different 
styles and with different general intent-- under­
neath they all translate to an inner language of 
binary patterns, which may Just be thought of 
as patterns of X and 0. or light bulbs on and off. 
The innermost program follower of the computer 
goes down lists of binary patterns stored in the 
core memory, and carries them out as specific 
instructions. It also changes its sequences of 
operations under conditions that the programmer 
has told it to watch for. 
The most powerful and responsive com­
puter displays are those which build a second 
program follower which goes down lists of pic­
ture-drawing instructions also stored in the same 
core memory, 
FOLLOWER. 
rc.fVej-.cj scntei^-
**)m*-pc -pit j\srw. 
We may call this also a "list-of-lines" 
system, since the commands recognized by the 
display program follower are typically patterns 
that tell it what lines to draw. 
Typically also it has its own way of jump­
ing around in a program, and may jump to a 
specific list of lines, or subpicture, from numer­
ous other parts of its program, always returning 
each time to the point from which it had jumped. 
This -allows the same subpicture to appear in 
numerous places on the screen at the same time. 
(A program that can be jumped to by other pro­
grams which then resume operation is called a 
subroutine; thus the real, or most prestigious, 
name for such a device is a subroutining display.) 
This design has some extraordinary advan­
tages. One is that since the computer's program 
follower and the display's program foUower both 
share the same core memory, they can work to­
gether most intimately. When the user demands 
something new-- by typing, say, or pointing 
with a light-pen-- the computer can step in and 
take various actions. Its program can compose 
a new picture for the user, get something from 
a disk or tape memory, or switch the display's 
program follower over to a new picture it has 
already prepared. 
Most importantly, the computer can move 
images on the screen, allowing interactive~anTr 
nation on the screen under the user's control. 
Each time the display is about to show the same 
picture again, the computer simply supplies it 
with a new atartinfl point. Since the list of lines 
is typically in the form of sequences of lines 
relative to one another, the picture is drawn in 
a new place each time-- and thus seen to move 
on the screen. This design haa some extraordinary advan­
tages. One is that since the computer's program 
follower and the display's program follower both 
share the same core memory • they can work to­
gether moat intimately. When the user demands 
something new-- by typing, say, or pointing 
with a light-pen-- the computer can step in and 
take various actions. Its program can compose 
a new picture for the user, get something from 
a disk or tape memory, or switch the display's 
program follower over to a new picture it has 
already prepared. 
Most importantly, the computer can move 
images on the scren. allowing interactive ani­
mation on the screen under the user's control. 
Each time the display starts to show the same 
picture egain, the computer simply supplies it 
with a new starting point. Since the list of lines 
is typically in the form of sequences of lines 
relative to one another, the picture is drawn in 
a new place each time-- and thus seen to move 
on the 
Finally, the computer itself is free moat 
of Ihe time-- free, that is, to do other things, 
which typically is always desirable. Just how 
much the computer can or should do in such a 
partnership is n matter of dispute. (Ordinarily 
such devices arc spliced onto minicomputers; 
and minicomputer fans, such as the author, see 
no reason not to perform all services for the dis­
play there in the minicomputer-- and a pox on 
the big machines. Others, for various reasons. 
Bee the subroutining display and its host mini 
as needing the tender ministratious of a4 big-
computer via some sort of communications line. 
There are various reasons for holding this en­
tirely legitimate view. People who are devoted 
to the high number-crunching capacity of big 
computers, or to languages which require great 
big computers to run in. have a right to their 
opinion. Moreover, it is currently feasible lo 
store large bodies of data only on big computers 
— not because big disk and tape memories can't 
be easily attached to the small ones, for they 
can, but they usually aren't; and other ways to 
tie minicomputers to big stores of data aren't 
available yet.) 
Subroutining displays often hove commands 
allowing them to display text as well as lines 
and dots. In the display of text they can use 
the some technique of "moving the picture" by 
starting its display at successively creeping 
points; this will cause, say. whole paragraphs 
to slide on the screen. The importance of 
this feature in the displaying of text cannot be 
iphasized. As more and more people have 
experience with displays of different kinds, they 
are beginning to realize how confusing and dis­
orienting it is for a screen to clear and be filled 
with something new to read. You don't know 
where you are. On subroutining displays, 
moving the text con give the reader the same 
sense of orientation he gets from turning pages 
— an important thing to replace. 
It must be stressed here that, just as com­
puters themselves have no fixed mode or style 
of operation, neither do computer displays; and 
so the purpose of such devices is simply 
HELPING PEOPLE SEE AND MANIPULATE 
PICTURES AND TEXT 
IN ANY STYLE, AND FOR ANY PURPOSE. 
Since pictures can be of anything, and text can 
be about anything, this effectively comprehends 
the entire mental and working life of mankind. 
Many readers will scoff, supposing that 
computer display systems will always cost tons 
of money. This is not Ihe case. You can al­
ready get a beauty, with its minicomputer, for 
as little as $13,000; and this price should fall 
to three or four thousand within a few years--
as soon as the minicomputer manufacturers realize 
that the market frontier is not in the office or 
factory, but in the home. But we're getting a 
bit ahead of ourselves here. 
TYPES OF SUBROUTINING DISPLAY 
Some early subroutining displays used a 
screen-dotting technique, but took the burden of 
it off the computer itself; it would extract from 
core memory the instructions telling it to draw 
individual lines and show text. (1 refer here 
to the DEC model 338, introduced about 1965; 
this attached to a PDP-8 computer (see p.'jT) 
and cost about $50,000 including the computer.) 
Others drew lines as straight zips of light across 
the screen; an example is the IBM 2250 diaplay, 
introduced about 1966. (The model 1 of thia 
device buckled directly to the 360, and cost, 1 
believe, something like $75,000; its successor, 
the model 4, buckled to their 1130 minicomputer, 
the package costing some $150,000, and then 
you were supposed to attach it to an IBM 360.) 
The 2250 was a good machine, but in perfor­
mance suffers greatly from the restrictions of 
the 360 computer itself (see p.4j ). These earlier machines are being replaced 
by new versions with better-designed instructions 
(see "Computer Architecture," p. "$2.. tor a sense 
of what well-designed instructions are). An es­
pecially fine unit is DEC's OT40, which buckles 
on the exceptionally fine PDP-11 minicomputer 
(see p.*tt-). The GT40 is illustrated nearby. (?%) 
It goes for aome $12,000 including the computer. 
(That's today, we repeat. Consider noi the price 
at this instant, but how fast it's going down.) 
The units mentioned above are of the moat 
basic type: "two-dimensional," whose pictures 
at any given instant correspond to flat drawings 
-- but, of course, derive their excitement and 
magnificence from their capacity to interact, 
change and animate whut you are looking at.

Seld cm has an event in a new field had as much power and 
Influence aa what dour Ivan Sutherland did as a young man V the 
period 1960-64. ~ 
The SKETCHPAD system,which was basically hla theale work at 
HIT, waa at once Inventive, profound, overwhelmingly Impressive 
to laymen, snd deeply elegant. Simply for the universal influence 
It has had In the computer field. It deserves our close attention. 
Sutherland was one of the first people to understand the use 
of the computer in helping people visualize things that weren't 
fully clear yet— the opposite, of course, of the conventional 
notion of computers. While computers had been made to do animations 
as early as the forties, and computer graphics had been put to work­
aday duties in the old 5ACE system (defending us against bombers in 
the fifties— remember the good old days?), Sutherland turned com­
puter display from an expensive curiosity into a true dream machine. 
SKETCHPAD ran on the 36-bltTX-2, a one-of-a-kind experimental 
machine at Lincoln Laboratories (a military research place nominally 
a part of MIT). It had a diaplay screen, light pen and lots of handy 
switches. 
SKETCHPAD was basically a drawing system. But rather than 
simulating paper (as some people might have done), it found splendid 
ways to take advantage of the computer's special capabilities. 
In the Sketchpad system, Sutherland looked for ways that a 
responding computer display screen could help people design things. 
He pioneered methods of drawing on screens, with such techniques 
as the "rubber-band line" (a straight line on the screen, one end 
of which follows your lightpen while the other remains fixed), and 
the "Instance"— a subpicture stored In core memory which could 
appear numerous times and ways in a larger picture). 
This picture vaguely 
eimulatee the "instance" 
facility of Sketchpad, 
by uKicn an overall 
picture may be created 
out of repetitions of a 
c ingle master pattern. 
..ilated with GRASS 
'.-.Kjuage (see p.32). 
The mind-blowing thing about Sketchpad was the way you could 
move and manipulate the picture on the screen, with all Its parts. 
One overall picture could be constructed out of a hundred copies 
of a basic picture; then a change In the basic picture would Im­
mediately be shown in all hundred places. Or you could expand 
your picture until it was effectively the size of a football field 
(with you looking at a tiny view In the handkerchief-sized screen). 
Or you could draw meshing gears on the screen, and with the light-
pen (and through the "constraint" facility) make one gear turn by 
turning the other! 
the constraint,does not seem to have 
onstraint" was a restriction placed 
ill stored picture complex. The user 
various parts of the picture on the screet 
matralnts could only move in certain dl-
dragglng other This elegant technlqi 
been imitated even now. i 
on some part of the overa. 
could move or manipulai 
but the parts that had 
rections, or according to certain fonnuL 
parts along, etc., as specified. 
This was a profound Idea, because It meant that any rules for 
the manipulation of particular objects on the screen could be added 
to Sketchpad as particulars within the larger program, rather than 
having to be programmed in from scratch. 
(One extremely interesting aspect of Sutherland's thesis, which 
most people aeem to have missed, dealt with displaying a structure 
of constraints: that is, showing what elements depended on what 
other elements, in a highly abstracted diagram that the system could 
show you. This form of display has remarkable possibilities. 
After his brilliant SKETCHPAD work, Sutherland waa made head 
of ARPA's computer branch (see "Military." p. 33 ). There he wea 
involved In many of the computer funding decisions of the late 
sixties, which contributed to the impetus of computer display. 
(His predecessor, Licklider, had been a pioneer In time-sharing, end 
much of the forward movement In the computer field In recent years 
may just have had to do with the strategic position of those two men 
when they were at ARPA/IPT.) 
Sketchpad went on as a continuing research tradition at Lin­
coln Labs. Timothy Johnson, for instance, made a version of it that 
allowed the drawing of three-dimensional objects; thla became the 
forerunner of the various three-dimensional line systems described 
hereabouts• 
From ARPA. Sutherland went on to the University of Utah, 
whence he slipped off with the Computer Science department chair­
man to found the Evens and Sutherland Computer Company, makers °*

How do computers make movies? 
Well, first of all, computers do not make 
movies unless thoroughly provoked. 
In fact, only people make movies. But 
computers, if sufficiently provoked, will do a 
lot of it: enact the movie and photograph it, 
frame by frame. 
There is no single method. 
All forms of computer display and computer 
graphics may be used to make computer movies. 
"Computer animation" is any method of mak­
ing movies in which a computer successively 
draws or paints the successive individual frames, 
which may be done by any of the methods mention­
ed in this book. Now, since there are numerous 
methods of making pictures by computer, then any 
method of making different individual pictures, 
in a succession of changing frames, is computer 
animation. So a "computer movie" is any film 
made by, or with the picture-making aid of, 
computers. 
In other words-- it's no one thing. 
Now, there already exist hundreds, if not 
thousands, of computer movies. So far most of 
them have been on technical topics-- the mecha­
nics of satellite orbit stabilization, the 
mechanics of explosions and so on. 
Here are a few stills from some other movies, 
more humanis tic.

By now there are dozens of computer anima­
tion languages— perhaps hundreds. Each one em­
ploys the techniques of animation which itB de­
veloper wanted to use, tied together in the ways 
that seemed appropriate to him. (See "Computer 
Languages," p. 15, and note Knowlton's various 
animation languages, described nearby.) 
One of the more influential animation systems 
has been Ron Baecker's GENESYS, a 2-dLmensional 
animation system programmed in the late sixties at 
MIT's high-security Lincoln Laboratory. (It used 
the TX-2 computer, mentioned elsewhere in this 
book.) 
Baecker, a cheery and genial fellow, expressed 
interest as a student in using the TX-2 for anima­
tion, and was allowed to. The system he produced 
has a number of lessons for us all. 
GENESYS is a "Good-Guy" system,as discussed 
on p. I Heaning, in this case, that it is 
easy to learn and simple to use. As argued else­
where in this book, making computer systems clear 
and simple is often hard for the programmer (and 
may go against his grain), but is essential. 
PICTURES AND MOTIONS 
GENESYS makes the following simplifications 
of your movie: all images are made up of dots. 
They do not change as you watch; animation con­
sists of the images either moving or being re­
placed . 
To create an image, you draw it onto the 
screen with a lightpen or a tablet. (As in the 
SKETCHPAD system; see p.^O Parts of. the 
image may be changed until you're satisfied. > 
A ^ / Lynn Smith is a young Boston artist 
who has worked extensively with Baecker's 
GENESYS (see nearby). One result has been 
a movie which should be an example to us 
all: "The Wedding Movie for Bob and Judy " 
(Her Friends Bob and Judy were getting 
married, so she made this movie, a few mi­
nutes long and quite clever, to celebrate 
it. ) 
This is my favorite example of how 
computers should be used in the human 
world; it says more on the subject than 
any dozen articles. 
(One question that remains unanswered 
is how a system like GENESYS could have 
been used for such a purpose, seeing that 
most people in the field believe GENESYS 
only rum on the heavily-guarded TX-2 com­
puter. Regretfully, I can shed no light 
on this here.) 
Now, to create the animation, you do the 
same thing. Each image can be made to move on 
the screen; and the path of the motion may be 
drawn on the screen, through the picture area. 
Not only that, but the timing of the motion is 
controlled through the same diagram, by the 
spacing of the dots. (Baecker calls his control 
diagrams p-curves•) 
Lastly, sections of picture may be re­
placed by means of the control diagram (a7 
indicated in picture above). 
Having created such an animated sequence, 
which is stored in symbolic form in the com­
puter ( digitally"), you can vleu lt on tlu, 
screen, decide what you do and don't like 
about it, and change any part of lt. 
The basic elegance of the system is this: 
Baecker made everything work the same way, 
through control by screen diagrams. He simpli­
fied the animation problem i„ a clear and simple 
Ron now teaches In Canada and is into work­
ing with PDP-lls. The results should be fun. ^ Computer

are what you use to make computer movies. 
Basically they consist of a CRT and a movie 
camera in a box. 
Mostly they are used to put text on 
microfilm by computer, so generally they 
are not connected to a computer but run 
off magnetic tape. 
This turns out to be very annoying if 
you want to hook up the computer directly 
to the COM, and make movies that fill the 
frames spot-by-spot. For that you really 
need your own movie camera and a minicompu­
ter. (Movie cameras that can be made to 
start and stop by computer are called "pulse 
cameras" or "instrumentation cameras.") 
The society for people who make Movies by 
Computer is called UAIDE - (Users of Auto­
matic Information Display Equipment— an 
obsolete title). It used to be a club just 
for companies that owned COMs made by 
Stromberg Datagraphix, but evidently it has 
now cut itself loose and become a subsidiary 
of the National Microfilm Association, 8728 
Colesville Road, Silver Spring MD 20910. 
(NOTE: for them as want to make color 
movies, the two alternatives have been either 
to have separate primary negatives combined 
at a lab— the "old Technicolor" process­
or to add a complicated color-filter box to 
a COM or other CRT setup. Such things are 
available commercially now, from Dicomed— 
a whole Color COM.)

TO MOVE BETWEEN LESSONS, the basic action is to hold down SHIFT and

Folk thing 
The TUTOR language grew out of drill-arid-
proctlce, for which lt haa a command specifying 
where a student's answer Is to appear on the 
screen. This is the "arrow" ccaaund. The lan­
guage has a strange scanning structure built 
around thia "arrow* command, auch as the TRAC 
Language (see pp. 18-21) has a scanning struc­
ture built around parentheses and coeamas. Be­
ginners don't need to understand the scan and 
the arrow command, but journeymen do. 
TENCZAR'S CONCEPT OF A CONCEPT

for "analyzing the c

s powerful techniqui Basically, TUTOR'S "concept" facility 
reduces every input word to a 60-bit code. 
The technique of reduction (called a "hashing 
function") supposedly substitutes for any 
word of any language a code of 60 bits (see 
"Binary Patterns," p. 33), which means the 
program in TUTOR can rapidly test s student's 
input for numerous different possible things. 
(The power of this technique will be readily 
recognized by computer people; unfortunately 
there is no room to explain it further here.) 
Thus a TUTOR program may contain "concept 
searches" that test whether a student types 
either a desired response or numeri 
native*. While lt nay be strange i 
thi* a "concept," ' 
Paul Tenczax'a TUTOR language, the pro­
gramming language inside PLATO, is like any 
other programming language (see pp. 15-31}) 
intricate, and unlike its results. That is, 
a program bears no more resemblance to what 
it doe* than the word "cow" looks like a COM. 
PLATO Is a system for canned presentation* 
that respond to the student. Student* need 
not know TUTOR. Anyone out to prepare such 
presentations must leaxn it, howevert and the 
attempt has discouraged many. 
Tenczar is a former biologist, and had no 
preconceptions from computer orthodoxy to bind 
him in the design of TUTOR. Thus the lan­
guage is very original. There is only room 
to raise the following points:

r THREE-DIMENSIONAL LINE DISPLAYS 
So far we've discussed (he two-dimensional 
subroutining displays- However, things do not 
by any means slop there. A number of people 
in the early days experimented with techniques 
for drawing line pictures by program; the ear­
liest of these used plotters • output devices that 
let the program draw with a pen. But interest 
soon grew in the possibility of interactive three-
dfmenalonal displays on screens. Johnaon's 
Sketchpad 4 did this entirely by program. But 
as night follows day, people set about putting 
these techniques into hardware, creating devices 
that would automatically show things in three-
dimensional viewB-- allowing the viewer to 
rotate views of nonexistent objects as if they 
were on unseen turntables. 
The views wc are talking about, now, co 
siat of bright lines on a dark field, and so the 
"objects" wc arc talking about arc called "wire­
frame" objects-- they could effectively be made 
of welded wire. But now wc do not have to 
build them physically to see them. Actually Adage had a tremendous lead in 
this field, but they let it slip for aome reason, 
and have now lost II to two firms: Evans and 
Sutherland on the high end, Vector General on 
the low end. (But of course things keep chan­
ging.) 
The Evans and Sutherland Computer Com­
pany was founded In 1966 by Ivan Sutherland, 
creator of the masterful Sketchpad system, and 
David Evans, chairman of computer science st 
the University of Utah. (For a time both held 
appointments at U2 at the same time, but now 
both have left the university to devote full time 
to their dream factory in Salt Lake City.) 
Their first product was an extraordinary 
piece of hardware called the LDS-1. which they 
aafd innocently stood for Line Drawing System. 
{To anybody from Utah, however, LDS means 
Latter-Day-Saint, and don't you forget it. Evans, 
indeed, is a Mormon, but I've been told it may 
have been Sutherland's sense of humor that 
chose the acronym.) 
It should be pointed out that a special ad­
vantage of digital perspective calculation is that 
viewed coordinates can be read back by the com­
puter, and serve as new data, if you go for 
that sort of thing. INTERACTIVE ROTATION 
Basically a three-dimensional system of 
this type stores the lines as coordinates in threes: 
cndpolnts of lines in a mythical three-dimensional 
apace. Each point's location in the space is told 
by three numbers (example showing a house 
may be seen on p. ): a line in a space is 
represented in the data structure by two such 
points, and a code or something tying them to­
gether. 
The computer, at penman, draws lints 
• stored in core memory. In a 
' system, trie basic 
mates is converted 
representing a particular 
The second program follower in such a 
device behaves much as it does in the 2D system, 
but with certain additions. Like the 2D system, 
it proceeds down its own program one step at 
a time. Like the ZD system, it finds in its 
program the coordinates of a line to display and 
creates electronic signals representing its end-
points. But it does not display these directly, 
since these are three-dimensional coordinates. 
Instead it routes these signals to what we may 
call a view calculator, a particular piece of hard­
ware that has been primed with the angle from 
which you want to view the object. This view 
calculator, automatically and by mysterious means 
which vary among machines, produces the view, 
and Us signals go to the screen. 
Let's say we want to display a point. The 
display's program follower pulls three numbers 
from its display list and notes the code that says 
it's a spatial point and not the end of a line. 
These three numbers slide on into the view cal­
culator, already primed with the angle of rota­
tion; and the view calculators riggers where on 
the screen that point should be displayed. The 
coordinates for the* screen-- telling where the 
point goes in the desired picture-- go to the 
screen controller, and the point is brightened. 
How are these coordinates calculated? 
Well, some commercial units do it electronically 
("in analog") and some do it symbolically ("in 
digital"). The result is the same. 
(If you want the equations for this, they'.re 
in the Newman and Sproull book.) 
Then how does the view calculator handle 
a line? Same thing. 
The program follower pulls three numbers 
from its display list and notes the code that says 
it's a line, so it takes three more. Then the 
view coordinates of both points are calculated 
and fed to the screen controller. The screen 
controller now has two points on its screen--
so it draws a line between them 
The first device of this type waa. I think, 
the so-called Kludge (pron. "Klooj"— computer slang 
lor a ridiculous machine, but in this case applied 
affectionately) built at MIT's Electronic Systems 
Laboratory i„ the early sixties. This device was 
a one-of-a-kind, built out of DEC circuit cards and 
hooking to a bigger machine. The ESL Kludge showed 
vividly how good it was to have instantaneous view 
calculation under a user's control. 
The first of these systems to be offered 
commercially. I believe, was the "Adage Display." 
made by Adage, Inc. of Boston, which used their 
unusual Ambilog computer (see p. */3) to rotate 
objects on the screen. 1 vaguely recall that it 
cost about $80,000 with computer but without ac­
cessories . The Adage Display is isometric. meaning 
that lines do not get shorter as they get farther 
away or longer as they get closer. While this 
is marvelously impressive, most people want 
real perspective; and it was this that Evans ajid 
Sutherland set about to moke available in real 
time, i.e., in direct response to the viewer's 
actions. 
The LDS-1. weighing in at half a million 
dollars or so, buckled to the PDP-10, a big 
36-bit computer from DEC (see p. 40). Its 
view calculator worked symbolically (digitally), 
and thus could work to the higher precision 
necessary for true perspective calculation. 
Among the exciting demonstrations that 
you can see sitting at an LDS-1 are a map of 
the United States you can zoom in on, bringing 
you in to a map of New Jersey, then Atlantic 
City, then a specific intersection, all in one 
smooth continuous motion. Also a simulated 
landing on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier 
-- with you flying the airplane, so you can 
go over it, to the side, into the drink or straight 
at the carrier. In all cases the ghostly ship 
will move, turn and change perspective on the 
screen as if somehow it were really there. 
Several LDS-Is were sold. 
Meanwhile a little new firm of young guys 
in Southern California, Vector General, came up 
with a line of terminals like the Adage line, ex­
cept that they could buckle to the 16-bit minicom­
puter of your choice. (In practice moat of them 
have been attached to PDP-lls; see p. Sc..) 
The Vector General display is isometric, 
and makes its calculations in analog, like the 
Adage Display. It has been very successful a-
mong both universities and private corporations. 
In addition, a highly interactive and well-
designed language is available for the creation 
of data structures representing 3D objects, as 
well as for general-purpose programming and the 
creation of whole environments. And it's free 
to individuals or companies that have Vector 
General displays attached to PDP-lls. (See 
"Coup de GRASS," p->\3/.) 
But wait. Evans and Sutherland has now 
dropped the LDS-1 and given us-- no, not LDS-2, 
but something called The Picture System— also 
built onto the PDP-11, but this one works sym­
bolically (digitally) and in full perspective. The 
price starts at eighty grand. 
Since the Picture System works out of the 
PDP-11 core memory, the commands it follows 
are 16 bits long, since that's the size of a slot 
in PDP-11 core. But wait. They've designed 
the thing to convert to 36 bits, so that coordin­
ates are moved to a private store or buffer be­
tween the program follower and the display. 
This means the display can zoom and zip around 
in the scene without bothering the computer. 
rpp-11, 
Another important feature of The Picture 
System: it will do, not just ordinary perspective, 
out such weird view calculations as wideangle 
barrel distortion, pincushion distortion and 
similar stuff. ia Ida from their fun and exc lta-
•ant— allow people to understand and work with

able to turn and manipulate the structure on tha

perceive the 3D structure, because the arrangement

they were on turntable* behind a pane of gla*s.

Thla Interaction Is what make* computer dis­
play augur a new era for mankind. If we're lucky. 
(It's also why we use the term computer display 
in this book, rather than "computer graphics," 
since people who make computers draw with pens are 
also doing "computer graphics"— a related activity, 
but not one to change the world.) 
UNFORTUNATELY, just to get through the basics 
there is only room to discuss stick-figure 
graphic display here. But curved surfaces 
may also be depicted, though usually not inte 
actively. See below, and pp. i>*\3(-}.

"quadric surfaces"— that is, invol­

calculated the visible lines tangent to

parts of the curves is of course one of 
the greatest problems. (From Ruth A.

The rules of perspective have been under­
stood since the Renaissance. In olden computer 
times (up till about 1965) people used to do 
three-dimensional view calculation by angles 
relative to a three-dimensional data structure. 
Then Larry Roberts at MIT noted that there was 
a more appropriate mathematical method, long 
moldering in obscure texts. The idea is this: 
if you add an extra dimension to the data, it's 
easier to program. It's easier because it be­
comes a simple matrix multiplication, which has 
no common sense explanation but is important to 
mathematicians. 
SO that means that to calculate views of 
three-dimensional objects, the most usual way 
is now to add that extra dimension. Instead of 
having a point in space whose position is 36-24-
36 (in some set of three-dimensional coordinates), 
another arbitrary number is added to make it, 
say. 36-24-36-1. 
It seems that in the mathematics of multiple 
dimensions, it comes out simpler that way. In­
deed, from a mathematical point of view the new 
improved dimension is just like the other three. 
For this reason, such an augmented system of 
coordinates is celled homogeneous coordinates. 
Like homogenized milk, Ihe additional coordinate 
is just stirred in with the rest, and out comes 
your desired view calculation. (The formulas 
are to be found in Newman and Sproull. Princi­
ples of Interactive Computer O rap hies , McGraw, 
$15, your basic text on the subject.) 
At any rate the additional coordinate is 
often referred to, incorrectly, as the "homogen­
eous coordinate." They're all homogeneous, 
which is why it works.

Myftfrp*!* GRASS 
impudent and plucky Tom DeFanti was an assist­
ant professor at 24. This in part because he has 
created one of the world's hottest 3D graphics lang­
uages, which he calls CRASS, (He says it stands for 
CRAphics Symbiosis System— also, he says, it Turns 
You On.) 
Tow's GRASS language is an excellent beginner's 
computer language for two reasons: first, it is easi­
ly taught to beginners, and second, lt is about things 
of interest to beginners, i.e., pictures and graphical 
manipulation on screens. (But compare the three be­
ginners' languages presented briefly on pp. 16-25.) 
A prototype for the system was developed at Ohio 
State, on a project directed by artist Charles Csuri. 
Tom had a free hand, though, and the language design 
is his; but much of the specific coding was done by 
Gerry Moersdorf, and the graphics algorithms and ro­
tation were programmed by Manfred Knemeyer. Inspira­
tion was furnished by Mnynard E. Sensenbrenner. 
GRASS runs on the PDP-11, a splendid minicomputer 
(Tom's is shown on p. 36) and is specifically designed 
for the control of three-dimensional stick-figure dis­
plays on the Vector General display system (see p. 
DM \ci ). But a lot of people have wrestled with theae 
matters and not done as well. Let's consider: 
-in H. The language ia extensible, meaning that the 
user may create new commands in the language as_ programs. 
These commands, however, may be used in later programs 
as if they were built into the language itself. 
I. The system is completely general-purpose. Many 
graphics languages are not, being restricted only to 
their original purpose. This is more difficult, but oh, 
so much more worthwhile. 
3. ITS DEEP GENERALITY. Things should be versatile, 
and able to be tied together in many different ways. This is 
what we mean by "generality;" and this kind of generality can 
make a system very powerful. (The term in mathematics is 
"elegance.") As is said on the other side of the book, com-
pllcatedness is not generality or goodness or power, but a 
sign of the designer's shallowness. 
Anyway, GRASS haa this kind of generality. It has a 
great number of facilities, growing weekly, and they all tie 
together in clear and predictable ways, without exceptions. 
Rather than create special functions which cannot be tied to­
gether. Young Doctor DeFanti has chosen instead to make the 
separate desirable functions part of a simple and clear lan­
guage. (A note to you elegant typos: GRASS is fully recursive 
As a nice example, Dan Sandin (see p.On.&) wrote a program to 
display Peano lines that was under forty GRASS instructions 
long. It is also astonishingly reversible: you can watch it 
uncreate the Peano line, straightening itself backward.) 
In the more usual sense, DeFanti'a language is not 
the 'most advanced'; there are more powerful 3D systems 
than the Vector General (the LDS-1, see p.iiMJo, offers 
true perspective), more elegant user-level languages 
(see TRAC Language and APL, other side), true halftone 
(the Watkins Box); yet his achievement on close examina­
tion is extraordinary. Never mind his age, the more eso­
teric features of his system (full recursiveness, etc.) 
or the fact that he does not seem to have made one mis­
take, which is infuriating. Consider only this: TOM DE­
FANTI 'S 'GRASS' LANGUAGE IS PERHAPS THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT 
CAN BE TAUGHT IN A FEW HOURS TO COMPUTER-NAIVE BEGINNERS 
THAT PERMITS FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL ANIMATED INTERACTIVE 
GRAPHICS WITH TREE-STRUCTURED DATA. 
1. ITS CLEAR SIMPLICITY. Tom believes computers 
are for everybody; he is not a high priest bent on mak­
ing things obscure (see "Cybercrud," p. 8). Thus he 
made his language as sensible, clear and easy to learn 
as possible. Tom likes to stress the concept of "habit-
ability" (a term of W.C.Watt), meaning the coziness of a 
system. 
2. ITS GENERALITY. Refining and condensing the 
baBic ideas of a system is the hardest part of the de­
sign. DeFanti made several interesting decisions. 
A. The internal form of the language is 
ASCII code (see p. ). In other words, you f»n 
read programs in their final GRASS form. 
B. For a three-dimensional system such 
as the Vector General, the main form of data 
structure is the three-dimensional object— a 
list of points and lines in space. This is the 
form of data GRASS uses for most purposes. 
C. In the design of such a system you 
want larger 3D objects to be buildable out of 
smaller ones. This itmplies arranging data 
in tree structures (see p. } . You also 
want to be able to make things do compound mo­
tions on the screen— for example, showing an 
airplane flying around on the screen with its 
propellor spinning; this too implies a Wee struc­
ture. There are some programmers who would use 
different tree structures for both objects group-
D. Objects shown on Tom's system can also 
appear to move on complicated paths through three-
dimensional space. In Tom's system, such a path is 
merely another object. It seems obvious when you 
say it, yet this kind of simple generality is ex­
actly what many programmers seem to avoid. (Note: 
this facility is a generalization of Baecker's p-
curve; see p.5«\t5). 
E. Input devices are completely arbitrary and 
programmable. What happens on the screen can be con­
trolled by anything— any variable (see p. jfc ) in 
the programming language. In other words, DeFanti 
has decoupled the screen from any particular form of 
control, allowing user programs to make the connect­
ion between controls and consequences. This means 
that, using Tom's language, it is comparatively easy 
to build complex custom controls for any function. 
(This is discussed under "Fantics,"* p-^)j-5j.) 
F. The language has string functions that allow 
text handling. Since the language may also use con­
versational terminals, it is eminently suited for 
"good-guy" interactive systems for naive users, as 
described on pp. 12-13. 
G. Tom's language is interpretive, like TRAC 
Language (see p. 30). That means it is "slow" in terms 
of the number of machine cycles required for it to do 
each operation. However, DeFanti has added a "com­
pile" feature to the language, so that for long macros 
(sections of program) that have to run repetitively, mo; 
efficient compiled versions of the macros may be gene­
rated. 
I coined the term fantics, for the art and technology of 
showing things, long before I ever heard of Tom DeFanti, 
and I am not about to change it just because he is now my 
friend and roommate. Tom DeFanti. Shows part

Data structure from 
Richard J. Feldmann, NItf. Much of today's impetus for 3D computer 
display is coming from the field of chemistry. 
University chemistry departments are buying 
equipment like the Evans & Sutherland LDS-1, 
the Adage and the Vector General. 
Why? 
Because chemistry is increasingly invol­
ved with complex three-dimensional structures. 
Crystals, long folding chain molecules, minus­
cule forces acting on structures whose shape 
determines the outcome. Organic molecules 
that involve thousands of atoms, and whose 
complex folded structure exposes only certain 
key features. And so on.

here and there on these pages belongs to the 
Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois 
at Chicago Circle.

the 3D Thtnkertoy, described on p.wS5 . However, it doesn't 
have any provision for the storage of large complex data 
structures, so the hard part would actually be working out an 
adequate storage data structure and storage macros within 
GRASS'S use of the DEC file system.) 
SCREEN CONTROLS 
The great thing about CRT displays is that they can be 
used to control things by_ manipulation of plcturet Instead 
of moving buttons or levers, you can seize parts of the pic­
ture with the light-pen and move some part of the picture.

DIMENSIONAL FLIP 
3D scopes are about the best we've got— so what do 
we do about multidimensional phenomena? 
One very good solution is to show a selection of thre* 
dimensions at a time, and provide for easy "flip" from one 
dimension to another— so that instead of looking at some­
thing on demensions A, B and C you are looking at it on di­
mensions A, B and X. 
For example, suppose you're a sociologist looking at 
measurements of various traits among a group of people. 
It's a cloud of dots in three dimensions— whatever three 
dimensions you're looking at. Some could be: age, height, 
weight, sex, ethnic background, premarital experience, ed­
ucation. .. etc. 
You view this cloud of dots, 
weight and ethnic background. Tr. 
around and see how many people in say, according to age, 
it means you can rotate it 
the group are what. 
Using dimensional flip, however, you can change the 
view as follows: rotate the box-frame till it becomes a 
square to your eye. Then you hit the control that makes 
the unseen dimension "flip" to another dimension that in­
terests you. The cloud still looks the same— until you 
rotate it, and the third dimension is now "premarital ex­
perience." So you can quickly get a view of how popula­
tions are really divided up. (Note to sociologists: this 
same operation, with stretching and clipping, provides a 
visual technique for "partialing" operations of the 
Lazarsfeld type.} 
THE TWISTED SMILE 
You can make a character change expression on a : 
scope by making his mouth a twisted wire that can be 
rotated between "frown" and "smile" positions. The 
trick Is the shape of the wire.

guage I know sf for doing all the above things.

To mosi people in the computer field, "computer 
graphics" means line drawing—systems snd programs 
for mapmaking, pipe layout, automobile and aircraft 
design, or any other activity where a diagram may 
help. Using line-drawing programs and equipment, 
designers may create line drawings on fast-respondmil 
graphic screens, reworking their ideas until satisfied; 
the system then disgorges polished drawings and speci­
fications for the designer's real intent, something else

look like things instead of wires. A picture that is not

Halftones in two dimensions 
Two-dimensional computer halftone is not new. 
Halftone pictures convened from photographs have 
often been printed out on line printers, either for fun (nudes often turn up at big installations), or in con­
nection with some scientific problem, such as analyzing 
chromosomes. Kenneth C. Knowlton, at Bell Labora­
tories, has executed some well-known photo conver­
sions making pictures into huge grids of tiny whimsical 
symbols having differeni grey-values. 
Various other systems have allowed users to create 
their own original 2-D pictures. Bul the natural temp­
tation is lo want the computer really to make pictures. 
Why not have the computer produce a photographic 
picture directly from the 3-D representation of objects? 
Computers don't do this by nature, any more than 
they do anything else by nature, so how it may be 
done by computer is very interesting. The problem is 
also interesting because of its intuitive nature. Visions 
of scenes in space are around us constantly, and we 
intuitively understand the geometry of outlines and 
light. As 3-D work progresses large problems are being 
overcome. The famed "hidden line problem," for en-
ample, was mislead in gly couched, since the problem 
is not finding what lines arc hidden, but whai surfaces

Of the objects are ascertained by 
programs or special hardware, 
using the same 3-D coordinates as in 
the ordinary systems. These visible 
parts are then shaded according 
to the appropriate color information.

We will discuss such systems in the present installment.

Al least two companies are building image systems 
that will behave and respond like onrushing realiiy. 
Such a system, hooked to cockpit-like controls, can 
she* a trainee pilot the delicate and precipitous results 
of what he does Realistic action, rather lhan surface 
detail, is crucial. 
The techniques of action polygon halftone were 
origmallv developed by General Electric, of Syracuse, 
N Y.. and are now also under development al Link 
Division of Singer Company (makers of the beloved 
pilot trainer and its progeny). Basically such systems 
operate upon ihe scan-lines thai crisscross a television 
screen, switching the color of the running scan as it 
crosses from polygon to polygon. 
The action polygon school—GE and link—takes 
a curious but effective approach to halftone TV: their 
"environments" arc composed entirely of convex objects 
made entirely of convex polygons To use only convex 
objects (no dents) means thai one objeel may be in 
front of another or vice versa, but never both. (An 
object with apparent indentations, such as an airplane, 
has to be made out of a group of convex objects flying 
together) To use only convex polygons (notchlcss) 
makes it easy for the system to decide, at a given 
instant, whether ihe scan is crossing the polygon or not.

Instantaneous enactment, halftone animation

This work evolved in pan from GE's work in the 
fifties with a "ground plane simulator," a system that 
would show a correct representation ol the ground's 
position, dipping and rotating, lo the pilot of an air­
craft in fog or night In 1963 the General Electric 
group, under Rod Rougelol. worked oul for NASA Ihe 
design of an "environment simulator"—a device that 
would simulate the appearance and performance of 
any equipment. This is now called the "old NASA sys­
tem. ' It permitted the user—seated before a color TV 
screen—to work controls for an imaginary aircraft or 
spacecraft, and sec roughly what the pilot of the craft 
would see. flying in real lime through a breathtaking 
color scene. Rims made on (his. machine have been 
stunning Imaginary cities, roller coasters and aerial 
dogfights arc among the visions that can be presented. 
General Electrics old NASA method is fairly weird 
if not mischievous. The earlier "ground plane simu­
lator" had shown an edge (ihe horizon) digitally dis­
played on a crt: the system was extended to many 
edges, and the logical analysis of areas between them. The edge-box reports summed into the facet boxes, 
each of which was set to respond lo a particular 
combination of left-right, above-below reports. Al the 
instant all the facet's edge boxes replied in 'he proper 
preset combination, the facet box signalled that its 
own Tacet was being crossed by the scan-line When 
more than one lacet-box responded, the one nearest 
ihe viewpoint had it* color gated to the *crccn. 
Now Rougelol's group is replacing the old NASA 
system by a new NASA system, which works on entirely 
different principles, bul keeps the vector calculator 
The old one could show scenes with up lo 240 edges: 
ihe new NASA system will al least double that. GE's new 
method is already operational on smaller research fa­
cilities. They don't tell what it is, bul basically il in­
volves sorting by distance. Supposedly the sort method 
is good enough to make the old edge boxes obsolete 
The Link group claims competitive performance for 
their system, which will go lo black-and-white thou­
sand-line TV. They say their system is different, better.

WyUe-Romney: shoot ihe works 
The Wylie-Romncy method, disclosed in 1967, was 
the Tint generally publicized procedure for making 
halftone pictures. Indeed, the 1967 publication sig­
nalled the explosion of the University of Utah into 
the forefront of computing research. 
The Wylie-Romney method was actually the joint 
work of Chris Wylie, Gordon Romney. David C. Evans 
and Alan Erdahl; hut much of the impetus for its 
development came from Evans, chairman of computer 
sciences al Utah, who had long suspected the possibil­
ity of 3-D halftone synthesis. 
Halftone lor art's sake now the artist can create 
worlds and photograph them. (Gordon Romney,

The method of Gary Walkin* is Ihe result of a 
profound search at the University of Utah for the 
method—a polygon technique fast enough for real­
time enactment, but cheaper than the GE-type systems 
and not subject to ihe convexity restriction*. They seem 
to have found it. 
Each video scan of the scene results in a "slice'' 
through surfaces in the scene. The two nearest surfaces 
arc continuously compared to see which is closer, as 
if by two rulers. The instant a new surface becomes the 
nearer one, the system makes it the visible one. TV 
nearest surface always shows, down to the precise 
instant two surfaces cross.

See top of preceding page. 
The scene was represented by a collection of edge 
boxes, physically jumpered into a collection of facet 
boxes. Each edge box and facet box was loaded with 
certain numerical and logic values, representing edges 
and facets in ihe scene, which could change between 
frames as required by the action. 
In the prcprocess for each frame the old NASA sys­
tem used a specially built digital computer, the "vec­
tor calculator." This performed at great speed the 
three-pan vector calculations necessary lo determine 
all scene positions, including the positions and slants 
of all edges. Each individual edge generator, loaded 
with its own edge position, constantly reported whether 
the running scan of the picture was to Ihe left or right 
of its own edge. It dutifully guarded this edge from 
border lo border of the picture. 
"Old NASA" method: Each edge box constantly 
reports which side of its edge the scan is on. 
each facet bo> sums the edge report* to sense 
whan the scan is crossing it The Wylie-Romncy method is this: for each picture-
point desired in the final picture, shoot a searching 
ray through the scene at a corresponding angle. Find 
where this searching ray hits every surface in its way. 
Since the locations in space of these hit-points are 
easily calculated, figure their distances from the vantage 
point. The nearest of the intersections is the visible 
one. Look up the color of that surface and shade the 
output point accordingly. 
This may sound inefficient, but it is comparatively 
easy to ascertain all the piercing-points, since the sur­
faces to be hit in a given scanning row can be largely 
predicted from the previous row. 
John Wurnock's method, also from Utah, is unre­
lated to the other methods, but has qualities mathe­
maticians like, as well as a certain whimsy. 
Consider a square in the picture area. (Al the start 
consider the whole picture area.) Sow then. Test 
whether the present square is entirely filled wilh one 
color. If so, output a corresponding square all of that 
color. If the present square is not all one color, divide 
it into four smaller squares. Take another square and 
go back to Now then. End the process when each of 
the squares in the broken-down picture has been 
completely filled with one color—or the unsatisfied 
squares arc too small to care about 
Warnock'x dicing method: What can t be made all 
one color is redivuled till its pieces can ba. Shading: Last of the great lodge-1 unctions 
Suppose that wc have some data structure represent­
ing a three-dimensional object, and a halftone method 
to search out its visible surfaces. How do wc shade the 
output pouits? What do wc take into account: how 
combine the basic greys or colors, how blend them 
with computations of surface angle, distances from the 
vantage point, or anything else we can think of? 
The answer: any way at all. The combining function 
is an aesthetic choice. There are not many areas left 
where you can make up a mathematical hodge-podge 
and get pleasing or interesting results. Computer half­
tone is a felicitous exception: you can augment by 
adding or multiplying, diminish by subtracting or divid­
ing, and yet always come up with an image resembling 
something. Anyone who has worked in a darkroom 
will recognize lhat this is like enlarging: playing with 
parameters won't obliterate the picture. 
There arc purists who insist that halftone coloration 
should exactly follow the formulas that simulate the 
behavior of real light. For some purposes, like pilot 
training, this may often be/true. But insisting on mathe­
matical accuracy as a general principle is like insisting 
on ultra-high fidelity—an aesthcuc judgment couched 
as a mechanical imperative. 
Until now the output hardware was not really ready 
for halftone. Five years ago a computer could usually 
create halftone pictures only on a line primer or a 
4020 microfilm plotter. Today there are many different 
photographic printers, going to all sizes of film and 
paper; one even uses a laser. There arc various display 
terminals permitting grey-scale and color halftone on 
TV screens. 
The age of computer image synthesis has begun. 
Polygon systems are fast and simple, and will come 
to be used in our daily lives for such diverse purposes 
as molecule study, the memorization of delivery routes, 
and visualization of every kind of layout and design. 
They will be fundamental to our new world of 
computer display. D

Surface patterns. 
Curvature. 
Shadow. 
THE PLOT SO FAR. 
Various computer methods now make it 
possible to create artificial photographs of 
three-dimensional objects or ccenes represented 
in the computer's storage. This is done by 
coloring or shading points in an output picture 
like the points in the scene that can be sighted 
through them from the vantage point. What 
the methods really boil down to, though, are 
searching processes in the data representation 
of the three-dimensional scene. 
In an earlier article we have considered 
some of the techniques being used to depict 
simple scenes— those made up of polygons. 
Now we turn to more elaborate scenes which add 
shadows, surface patterns and curvature. 
One of the most interesting things about 
this branch of computer graphics— already seen 
in the polygon methods discussed earlier— is 
the variety of techniques that can be employed. 
Moreover, these methods, for all their sophisti­
cation, can usually be intuitively understood 
as thought they were operations performed on 
objects in space. The same continues to be true 
for the more complex systems. VARIOUS NEW TECHNIQUES PERMIT US TO ADD CURVES, 
SHADOWS AND SURFACE PATTERNS 
TO COMPUTER-GENERATED HALFTONE PICTURES 
ENHANCED POLYGON SYSTEMS 
In the methods discussed so far, we looked 
at several computer techniques for photograph­
ically depicting scenes and objects made up of 
polygons-- planar facets-- in a represented 
three-dimensional scene. Imaginary houses of 
cards, cardboard airplanes and triangular scen­
ery take on a compelling vividness when depicted 
by the computer. And for visualizing such 
things as architectural arrangements, such 
systems promise to be of increasing practical 
value. 
Those of us interested in the artistic 
aspects of computer halftone images want more. 
This article looks at some ways to add the 
appearance of curvature and surface pattern 
to computer-synthesized images. 
MAGtlUSKI'S CONSTRUCTIONS OF REPEATED PATTERNS 
(different perspective calculations) 
Basic triangle pattern.. 
MAGNUSKI'S PATTERNED CONSTRUCTIONS 
A number of contributions have been made 
by individuals working alone. For instance, 
Henry Magnuski, at M.I.T., created a program 
that repeatedly positions patterned facets in 
space to make large constructions. 
This program did not calculate "true" 
shadow, basing its shading partly on angle of 
surfaces. Neither does it show true curves. 
Yet it shows the impressive degree to which 
such effects may be approximated. The result­
ing beach ball picture is reminiscent of Moorish 
architecture. is stitched together 
in adjacent positions 
at appropriate angles. BOUKNIGHT AND KELLEY: 
PICKING THROUGH A CAT'S CRADLE 
The method of Bouknight and Kelley. at 
the University of Illinois, permits the addition 
of shadow to polygon pictures. Their method 
uses an intricate system of scanning sweeps 
across the scene, analyzing the successive edge-
crossings. For each output line, a list of the 
edges in the scene is ordered according to which 
will be next encountered. To make a specific 
output line of shaded points, we step through 
successive positions of the scan-line, until an 
an edge is crossed. With each edge we cross, 
we enter or leave at least one facet. Of all 
the current facets we are in after a given edge-
crossing, the system finds out the nearest one, 
the visible one, by comparing distances. The 
coloration of this facet is then fed out to the 
picture, until the next edge-crossing. 
Bouknight and Kelley expand their method 
to show shadows by an additional step. They 
create a new list of edges to be encountered, 
this one relative to scans from the light source. 
Then, during the regular output picture scan, 
they look to this latter data to see about shadow. 
As soon as they know two consecutive edges 
of a visible object in the picture, they are able 
to search the shadow-edge list to see if any 
shadow-edges impinge between them. The final 
list of edges-- visible facet edges and shadow 
edges-- goes to the picture output device. 
BOUKNIGHT-KELLEY METHOD 
/Is) -
Consider the series of edges whose 
projections cross the current scan-line. 
Each time the scan-line crosses an edge, 
find out what facets are currently pierce 
by a sight-line from the viewpoint. The 
nearest of these facets is the visible on 
To add shadow, use an extra list of 
the scene' s edges relative to the light 
rather than the camera. Between viewed 
edges, check for shadow-edges as well.

DON LEE FILLS IN THE GAPS 
Don Lee, at the University of Illinois, 
produced his finc-toned pictures of spheres in 
1966 simply because someone bet him a quarter 
he couldn't program the method he'd suggested 
in twenty-four hours. He almost made it. He 
made his pictures of spheres and polygons by 
calculating the boundaries, then checking for 
overlap and filling in with greys according to 
viewing angle. His program works only in 
special cases, but is interesting for its historical 
position; it was one of the earliest half-tone 
curvature systems. 
HAVE A BALL WITH DON LEE. SIMPLEX CURVATURE SYSTEMS: MAHL & MAGI 
A fundamental type of system we may call 
the "simplex" system was exemplified in the 
previous article by the Wylie-Romney program. 
A simplex technique simply projects simulated 
rays toward the scene from the vantage point 
till they hit the represented objects, and fills 
corresponding positions on the output picture 
with the colors encountered on the front surfaces 
of objects in the scene. 
The same principle extends naturally to 
scenes with curved and otherwise embellished 
objects. 
Robert Mahl, at the University of Utah, 
has recently reported his results with simplex 
methods using quadric surfaces— those curved 
surfaces generated by mathematical powers of 
two. His pictures— like the cup and saucer 
shown here— have a pleasing 1920s Bauhaus-
like quality. 
Then fills in 
curvaceous 
shading. One problem with this method is that 
computational complexity increases rapidly as 
the scenes grow more complex; the more surfaces 
and piercing-points, the more time-consuming 
(and expensive) it becomes to make the picture. 
His program first works out 
the general outlines.

It seems, however, that Mahl's work may 
only be a rediscovery of what one organization 
worked out earlier and is being secretive about. 
A firm delightfully called MAGI (Mathematical 
Applications Group. Inc.) of Elmsford, N.Y., 
has extended the same idea more elaborately. 
They happened into the halftone game through 
a military contract. 
MAGI's system, now thoroughly developed 
under Robert Goldstein, began in 1965 in a study 
of radiation hazards in battlefield equipment. 
They wrote a program to simulate paths of radia­
tion, say, that might reach a tank driver under 
varous disagreeable circumstances. Having 
written a program that would ascertain the sus­
ceptibility to radiation of battlefield machinery, . 
they noted that the same program could be 
adapted to making photographs. The progam 
simulated radiation; light is radiation; ipso 
facto, pictures. Substantially the same program 
would make photograph-like images, by treating 
the objects as opaque, and reflecting different 
shades according to color and angle of view. 
The resulting system makes nice pictures 
of objects composed of planes and quadric sur­
faces; and includes, as will be seen from the 
racing car and chair, colored surface designs, 
shadows and spectral reflections. Not only does 
MAGI's software for this process produce deli­
cately shaded pictures; if the virtual picture-
plane is moved until it intersects the subject, 
it produces a cross-section. 
MAGI runs this program remotely in 
Fortran on a big computer-- but they have their 
own minicomputer setup for photographing the 
results as color movies. They now offer use of 
this system commercially for making movies or 
stills. MAG1 program waa originally developed 
for study of radiation hazards inside 
military armor; the pseudo-photographic 
techniques were a aide effect of the 
approach chosen. Who know: , these 
tanks may be the ones studied. 
HAGI techniques were used to study 
alternative ways of lighting nines. 
SYNTHEVISION SETUP uses remote time-sharing computer 
running big secret Fortran program and containing 
entire data structure of three-dimensional scenes. 
Minicomputer photographic setup Is on premises at 
Computer Visuals, Inc., HAG1 subsidiary marketing 
the Synthevision service. 
Local setup uses Uova minicomputer controlling both 
CRT display and camera. Informed guess would sug­
gest that time-sharing system does not send all 
successive points of output line, but difference 
and transition values; Nova program would then in­
terpolate gradations in relatively quiet sections 
of the scan-line. 
MAGI' s precise system is secret. However, the only 
real questions boll down to: forms of surface rep­
resentation; sys terns of scene sorting; and method 
of scene scanning to produce output scan. 
Note that one of the most impressive things about 
HAGI work, at least for sophisticates, is the de­
gree of artistic control chat seems to have been 
realized in their input and revision systems. It 
seems they offer excellent control over motion and 
color, and, of course, revision of the action in 
a scene till the aaker is satisfied. Enlargement from MAGI film. I hope 
the reproduction shows the concentric 
rings, called Mach bands, that divide 
areas of shading; Knowlton and Harmon 
(citation p. DM 10) advise on pseudo­
random techniques for correcting this. 
ROUNDUP 
These have been some of the highlights 
of the halftone game to date. The methods des­
cribed so far are mainly software-oriented, and 
for the most part work most efficiently as pro­
grams. In the next article we will look at some 
outlandish new forms of equipment, under con­
struction or proposed, for dedicated production 
of 3-D halftone pictures.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT IS NOW BEING BUILT 
FOR MAKING "REALISTIC" HALFTONE 
PICTURES BY COMPUTER. THIS ARTICLE 
COVERS SOME OF THE MORE UNUSUAL 
HALFTONE HARDWARE SYSTEMS NOW IN 
EXISTENCE OR BEING PLANNED. 
Results of Gouraud's swell smoothing technique. Mme. Gouraud posed 
for the dafa structure on the left, a system of interconnected .flat polygons. 
The Gouraud process (see box below) created the smooth-looking face 
from it by an extremely simple process. (Note that the power of the 
technique is in the use of a simple polygon data structure, rather than 
the more difficult truly-curved surfaces used, e.g., by MAGI.) 
(Note also that the edges remain jagged.) 
In two previous articles we have summar­
ized some of the important basic techniques in 
computer halftone-- the artificial construction by 
computer of photographic pictures of 3-D scenes, 
scenes which are represented within the computer 
as colored or shaded surfaces placed in a coor­
dinate system of three dimensions. The techniques we have looked at were 
all intuitively "spatial" in character, having to 
do with the analysis of sight-lines and relative 
edge positions, and suited to implementation in 
computer software. Now we turn to some more 
advanced and peculiar techniques and equipment 
intended to make 3-D computer halftone faster 
to use, or more realistic, or easier to work with, 
or cheaper. These systems represent a coming 
generation df'halftone hardware. 
I suggested this cover 
for this article. The 
folks at Computer Decisions 
reacted with puzzlement 
if not dismay. "This cover 
doesn't have practical 
applications for the 
ave ra^e user," I think 
someone said. THE WATKINS BOX 
The University of Utah is now building 
what wil be for some time the world's most 
spectacular interactive computer display, the 
Watkins Box. This device, interfacing between 
a computer and a television screen, will carry 
out the Watkins algorithm (described in the 
first article of this series) in real time; ripping 
through a predigested list of facet information, 
the Watkins Box will create on the screen an 
image of an opaque object which the user can 
rotate or see manipulated by program. 
The Watkins Box can operate in two modes: 
normal mode, in which the object appears faceted, 
and Gouraud mode, in which it appears to be 
curved over (see masks, nearby). 
The Gouraud algorithm, developed by a 
gruduate student of that name, is a ridiculously 
simple technique which marries perfectly to the 
Watkins method. Instead of shading the facets 
uniformly, this technique calculates a shade of 
gray for each point. In effect the method inter­
polates the shade of the point from those around 
it, across facet boundaries. In actual proced­
ure, the Gouraud method shades a point by 
linear interpolation between two edge-colors: 
the color of the last edge and the next edge to 
be encountered on the present scan-line. 
(These shades are in turn found by linear inter­
polation between their endpoints.) 
It will be noted that Gouraud's method 
does not curve the edges. But considering its 
simplicity as a small addition to the Watkins box, 
that's no great sacrifice. 
Naturally, the Watkins Box will not reach 
the private home for several years; current 
likely price is in six figures. But that's now. 
GOURAUD'S TWIST adds the appearance of 
curvature to a faceted object shown opaquely 
by the Watkins method (described in first 
article). 
Instead of shading each point within a facet 
with the same color, interpolate between the 
vertex-colors according to how far down the 
edges you've gotten. Note that the jagged 
edges are retained.

Roger Boyell, of Pennsylvania Research 
Aasocistes. Philadelphia, likes io refer to the 
company's main interest as "modelling the phys­

developed systems for cartography, landscape

wilt look just the way the radar would look on 
a real mission-- flying in perspective among 
: valleys, high or low. at any bear-

Doyen's approach is to treat each compo­
nent of the pictorial/radar simulation as a 
separate problem, to be handled in different 
ways, and blended in a final buffer, a core 
memory which ia read out to lelevision. Sepa­
rate mechanisms supply components of shadow, 
specular reflection, coloration and randomizing 
effects. The core buffer continuously refreshes 
the scanned CRT display. 
Boyell has put the same techniques to 
work making simulated halftone pictures of the 
moon (aee cut). Both the radar and moon sys­
tems use the same type of halftone image synthe­
sis, even though superficially they seem quite 
different. But radar is radiation, Just like light,

boy's dream. To be situated In Dry Lake. 
Arizona, the simulator will hava the moat real-
iatic cockpit* ever built: tha entire mock up will 
turn and tilt in response to Ihe user, and the 
seats will even swell and deflate. to simulate 
acceleration and weightlessness. The cockpits 
alone, without the visual diaplay screens, will 
cost ten million dollars each. 
But the viaual systems - ah. The pilot-
user will look out into an artificial world, among 
whose mountains and meadows and clouds he 
will fly in real time. Six CRTs. arranged aa 
parts of a dodecahedron in an entire viaual 
surround, will show him the changing terrain 
and flying environment. F.ach of theae CRTs 
will be driven by a real-time perspective 
halftone simulator, with all displays spliced to­
gether and driven by a master simulator res­
ponding to his actions. Who will build them ia 
not yet decided; they could be Warnock or GE 
The sheer joy of such a system will be 
hard to beat. But no doubt others will be on 
the way-- perhaps at the amusement pork level.

I don't expect you to believe this, because 
not even my patent attorney does, but the system 
I call Fantasm is intended to make pictures that 
pass the Turing-test: you won't be able to tell 
them from real photographs. Fantasm is inten­
ded to allow the user to make realistic, Hierony 
mus Bosch-like photographs and movies, with 
real-looking people (and scenery, imaginary 
characters, monsters, etc.) in scenes of arbi­
trary complexity. It is expected that 1975 eco­
nomics will make its construction feasible. 
Fantasm I originally conceived as a method 
of making realistic photographs and movies, not 
knowing at the time that thia was impossible, 
but feeling it could be done somehow if the 
problem were broken down sufficiently. At 
times it was not clear which of us would be 
broken down first, 1 or it. 
It occurred to me sometime in 1S60-1 that 
computer-interpolated, Disney-type cartooning 
methods would be feasible. After some thought 
1 realized that pseudo- photography would be 
possible, and dropped the cartooning idea. The 
atrange behavior of people whom I told about 
this led me to increasing secrecy. 
The general goal was to make a system 
thai could do realistic movies without scenery 
or actors, and make pictures indistinguishable 
from real photograph* of real scenery and 
actors. ("What do you mean, indistinguishable 
from photographs?" people keep asking. What 
do they mean what do I mean?) The surfacea 
are to be put in by "sculplora." animated by 
"puppeieera," and photographed by a "director." 
The objective is for moviemaking lo be under 
the utter imaginative control of the creative uaer. 
I am indebted to Prof. Che 
for the formalization of » 
function. 1 A scene of arbitrary curvature and topology Is represented 
in a ayatem of holding registers; the surface Is presented 
(through D-to-A converters and an array parallel function gener­
ator) to interrogating circuitry which steers an inquiring algnal 
around the represented surfacaa. Operation is empirical. Array 
has partition logic allowing almultaneoua queries of varloua sub­
surfaces. Feedback steering circuitry allows multiple loopa 
through array. Steering signal and returnatf surface parameter 
are analog and continuous. List techniquea manage ahadow and 
visibility 'umbrellas' (surfaces of occulted volumes or umbras). 
The Fantasm Scene Machine®1, tha representation and aaarch 
array, Is one chip repeated In a carpet. Large-scale Integration 
permits the required digital atorage of about 500 bits per sur­
face section plus analog circuitry and switching logic. Patent 
work underway. 
SUMMARY: outline* handled by Perimeter Parameter Occultatlon 
Chasing, flll-ln by Bullet Search, animation continuity management 
by list-processing technique.. The syatem could come in a number of dif­
ferent versions. One of these involves a large 
array of LSI computing modules (the checkerboard 
Scene Machine) to be guided by special hardware 
under an unusual monitor running on a general-
purpose computer. The checkerboard Scene 
Machine holds a great spread of surface data. 
It is a logical curiosity, an array that replies as 
a unit, ignoring cell boundaries, to electrical 
explorations of the shapes represented in it. 
The resulting trace makes varioua 3-space ex­
plorations on ihe faces, mountains or automobiles 
spreadeagled in il. Think of its trace as a 
radio-controlled firefly skating over a bumpy 
checkerboard. Using this machine, and various 
cat's-cradle list structures based on the geom­
etry of light around odd volumes of occupation, 
the problem of halftone analysis of arbitrary 
shapes is solved by brute force rather than 
analytically. A variety of other processeB have 
also been defined in Ihe syatem for other types 
of graphic application. 
As far as I have been able to learn. Fan­
tasm is the most baroque computer graphic system 
anyone has proposed. It is noi intended to oper­
ate in real time, but rather take as long aa it 
needs, or as long as Ihe uaer wants to pay for. 
(o fill in complex viaual details, shadow, reflec­
tions, curlicues, leaves, hair, etc. It is best 
suited to the production in Panavision of Busby 
Berkeley musicals, or "The Lord of the Rings" 
with realistic wraiths and interspecies battles. 
Bul it may well cost too much lo use for that. 
Indeed, its economics seem to improve in low-
budget settings like videotape, although there 
its output bandwidth will flower unseen. But 
the Scene Machine should also be uaeful for 
more mundane applications, auch aa contour 
mapping, automobile design, advertising photo­
graphy and medical illustration.

FOURTH ARTICLE. 
Systems of Computer Image Corporation. 
SO FAR WE HAVE SUMMARIZED AND DISTINGUISHED AMONG 
THE MAJOR TECHNIQUES FOR COMPUTER SYNTHESIS OF IMAGES 
FROM DIGITALLY STORED REPRESENTATIONS OF SCENES. 
WE NOW TAKE THE WRAPS FROM A DIFFERENT BUT RELATED 
SET OF TECHNIQUES - THE SYSTEMS OF 
COMPUTER IMAGE CORPORATION. 
Lee Harrison III got the ides for what is 
now Computer Image Corporation In 1959. Al­
ready having an art degree, he went on for a 
degree In electrical engineering, snd through 
long lean years put together the technical basics 
around which Cl'a systems are now built. Com­
puter Image Corporation Is now a going concern, 
and output from their systems. especially Scan-
imate, ia now widely visible on television. 
Computer Image Corporation aecma to be 
the first firm to be commercially successful In 
the halftone field. Whether they should be 
Included with the others is arguable, however. 
Their systems are not widely understood, and 
the relation of theae syatems to the other ayslems 
and programs described in these articles is 
problematical. Among the few who understand 
their techniques, some argue thai they do not 
synthesize images at all. but rather twist pre­
existing pictures with a sort of Moog synthesizer, 
and lhat their analog techniques are really just 
compound oscillators rather than Irue computing. 
I think that this view is wrong, at least as 
regards their most ambitloua system, and that 
CI's techniquea deserve review. All the world 
is not digital. CI aystoms do fill up areas with 
grey-scale (and other) pictures, and their sys­
tems involve three-dimensional coordinates, 
occultatlon and coloration; thus I think il ap­
propriate lo discuss them here. 
The following discussion is the first, I 
believe, to lift the veil of secrecy that has hith­
erto confounded observers of this company's 
work. In the light of the extreme sophistication 
wilh which Ihey have pursued extremely strange 
techniques, they should benefit from the wider 
understanding. (Note that this material, which 
has been assembled from various sources and 
careful TV watching, ia partly conjectural.) 
Computer Image's syatems represent an 
apparently unpromising approach brilliantly 
followed through. 
All of CI's systems are a strange combin­
ation of closed-circuit TV and analog components 
out of a music synthesizer: oscillators, poten­
tiometers, interconnection networks. The basic 
mechanisms are the same for all. but they ere 
carried to different logical extremes, with dif­
fering accoutrements, in the four systems. 
They all seem to be based on the extraordinary 
Animac II, not yet implemented; it would seem 
thai for business reasons the company decided 
to raise money promoting simpler systems, so 
its bread and butter now consists of two less 
ambitious systems, Scanimate snd Animac I; 
both of which might be puzzling if not recog­
nized as parts of a more elegant whole. It 
would seem they were designed backwards as 
spinoffs from Animac II, as was CAESAR. their 
more recent 2-D system. 
The extraordinary ramifications and 
varieties of this system, with sit its electronic 
add-on and composite methods, stagger the most 
jaded technical imagination. 
At the heart of the CI systems is the prin­
ciple of filling areaa of a CRT screen with an 
oscillating trace. This is a principle common 
lo both Lissajoua figures and television; but 
Computer Image has elaborated il peculiarly. 
By variations they paint twisted television images, 
wiggle sections of superimposed drawings, create 
moving filigree effects, and hope to animate 
whole groups of opaque electronic puppets in 
3-space. 
Consider an oscillating trace on an oscillo­
scope. This is a two-dimensional oscillation, 
having two signals, x and y. But a three-dim­
ensional oscillation is also possible; any third 
signal, z, can be interpreted as a third dimen­
sion, meaning that a "point of light" is whirling 
out some pattern in a three-dimensional space— 
an oacillotank. so to speak. Let us call this 
point moving in three dimensions a "space trace." 
Now lo view this trace we need to cut it 
down to two dimensions. By ignoring one of 
the traces we can view the oscillotank In certain 
fixed ways; but by creating a "view calculator," 
a box performing certain perspective tranaTor-
mationa on the three signals of the space trace, 
we may obtain a view of the oscillotank from a 
movable vantage point. This is an x-y view 
which we may put on an ordinary oscilloscope. 
Let us now add one more signal, b (for 
brightness). This is the brightness signal fam­
iliar in tele via ion. 
Brightness of the spot is thus independent 
of the movement of the apace trace. For example, 
the apace trace could describe a helical path, a 
sort of tornado motion, and we could time its 
apinning to phase with a TV signal. If we now 
brighten ihe apace trace only with the bright-
neaa signal of a TV pickup, we now will see 
(in our view of the oscillotank) what would look 
like a TV picture curled around itself in space.

BS separate bones (CAESAR. 
Tubelike shapes may be rotated and shaped in 
3D (Anlaic), and puppets nay eventually be rolled 
like cigarettes (Animac II), which may then be 
painted from a TV pickup on the aide nearest the 
viewpoint. 
By using a storage tube and spinning the trace 
close together, like cotton candy, and cutting off 
the painting signal while the trace is within the 
area already filled, we get electronic masking:

AND LATiiP,, IN THE SAME FRAME: 
cut off the 
brightness of 
already an lmaRe 
on the screen. A last Ct technique, technically minor but 
remarkable in effect, permits thla blocking end 
shadowing among separate objects. This is the 
use of a storage CRT tube on which every frame 
is painted (from the viewpoint or from the light 
source). The picture is painted on the storage 
CRT, nearest things first; snd the return signal 
from the screen tells whether the apace traee is 
crossing an area already painted during Ihe 
frame. The tube's output signal then effectively 
conBtitutea a silhouette. This clue Indicates that 
the space trace should not be visible; and hence 
is used lo cut off brightness while the trace la 
within the already-filled area. This gates 
between two desired objects or pictures, fore­
ground and background. If operated from ihe 
point of view of the light. It gates shadow: the 
signal is used to control the relative brightness 
of the shadowed and unahadowed features of a 
puppet in 1-apace. 
A fascinating variety of embellishments 
has been put into these systems by CI's ingen­
ious engineers. Coloration of Ihe final video 
signal ia added by gating color levels under 
control of the brightness signal, permitting pic­
tures with several grey-levela to be transformed 
to up to four rainbow hues. Separate shapes 
described by the space trace may be indepen­
dently moved and jointed at the same time: 
Harrison pointedly calls such separate shapes 
"bones." Darkening at the backside of a spun 
shape, or brightening at edges of a painted por­
tion, and brightening in proportion to curl, are 
all strange capabilities of this machine. Lip-
synchronized mouthlike motion can be imparted 
to any part of the shape spun by the space trace 
(whether or not a mouth is painted on it), by an 
audio detector feeding directly lo the circuitry 
from a live mike. And the limba of CI's ghostly 
figures can be made to swing by connection of 
sensors to Ihe animators themselves-- in a living 
pantograph. 
SCANIMATE is a popular device now widely 
used (at CI's studios) for the making of TV com­
mercials and station-break emblems. This is 
their simplest system, used for the conversion 
and discombobulation of flat artwork. In Scani­
mate. the space trace is controlled by hand-
operated potentiometers. Two separate oscillator 
settings are available, so that the space trace 
can have two separate oscillation patterns, 
spinning out two entirely different virtual shapea 
in 3-spacc. A handlhrotile eases from one 
oscillator setting to the other. This permits on 
image to be moved, shrunk or enlarged, or 
flipped; to go from whirling around to a sort of 
hula; and many more effects. The picture 
painted on it may be seen to roll on invisible 
spindles, bloom into fountains, or undulate as 
pennants-- all by modulating the brightness of 
the flying spot as it traces its unseen shape. 
This shape, in turn, can move between its two 
forms under control of the throttle. 
Animac 1 (usually called Animac) provides 
greater flexibility in controlling the space trace. 
The syslem's oscillations ore controlled by an 
input vidicon, which artists may quickly modify 
with pastel check at the pickup. Ghostly tubu­
lar lettering, swarming pendulum-patterns and 
jiggling filigrees are among the possible doodles. 
CAESAR, their newest system, is oriented 
toward Yogi Bear-type animation. The artist's 
cartoons are automatically superimposed on s 
background or each other. They may be moved, 
and made to wiggle under real-time control by 
the user. 
But it is to Animac II that these curiosities 
lead. What Harrison calls the "Snow While 
Capability" of Animac II will permit the sculpture 
of full humanoid puppets, wilh perhaps thirty 
articulated "bones." opaque to one another and 
casting shadows, colored, moving and talking.

WHAT ABOUT REAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL 
DISPLAY? 
In science-fiction stories you hear about 
how objects are made to appear as if they're 
standing in the middle of the room. For instance, 
I believe that in Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange 
Land they watched a "tank" in which things 
appeared. 
Well, a lot of people have thought about 
this, and it's not so easy as you might think. 
One interesting scheme used a sort of 
translucent propellor. spinning rather fast, on 
which computer-generated images were pro­
jected from below. It was done by the dotting 
method, so that a bright dot of light would ap­
pear high or low in space depending on whe­
ther it was projected on a relatively high or low 
point on the propellor. 
fW vW*r, 
This was interesting but had numerous 
disadvantages-- not the least of which was the 
danger of the thing flying apart. (Translucent 
materials tend not to be as strong as, say, 
metal.) Another basic problem, though, was 
the fact that any given point in the space could 
only be displayed at a given time, when the 
propellor's height in that region was just right, 
and that meant that at that given instant you 
couldn't display any of the other points that 
could only be displayed at that instant. A con­
siderable disadvantage. 
Probably the most astonishing 3D display 
is Sutherland's Incredible Helmet. This consists 
Df a helmet with two dinky CRTs mounted on it, 
each being driven in real time by a perspective 
system (such as the LDS-1) and set up with 
prisms to the wearer's eyes. Through the prisms 
the wearer can see the real world in front of him. 
Reflected in the prisms, however, and thus mixed 
into the view of the real world, is the glowing 
wire-frame being presented to him-- in perspec­
tive, and with its separate views merging into 
an apparent object in front of him. But he need 
not stand still: as he moves, the helmet's chan­
ging position is monitored by the program, and 
the display system changes the views accordingly 
meaning he can walk around and through a dis­
played object. The illusion, and the possibilities, 
are fantastic: imaginary architecture, explanations 
and diagrams of things in the room, poetry that 
changes as you walk through it, ... well, you 
work on it. Not available commercially. There was a lot to be said for tents. They 
could be made by tailors, rather than construc­
tion gangs; they could be transported and stored 
flat. Their surface-to-volume ratios couldn't be 
beat. 
Noting this, an architect named Ron Resch 
said to himself: what about making large-scale 
foldable structures, likeunto geodesic domes, 
that cou Id be simply manufactured in sheet 
form and creased at the factory, then bolted and 
cabled and strutted in the field? 
Resch has now for years been experi­
menting with complex folded structures. 
There's only one trouble. If you've 
messed with paper airplanes you know that 
folding is an inaccurate process, and so the 
prospect of discovering complex geometric struc­
tures by the hand-folding of paper is rather 
slim. 
Recognizing this, Resch has contrived to 
work at a computer display. His work— the 
search for great folding structures-- is one of 
the first practical uses of halftone polygon 
computer graphics. He is, naturally, at the 
University of Utah. Lou Katz, of NYU, put old-fashioned stereop-
ticons up to the CRT, and displayed two separate 
views to the two eyes. Works fine, even with 
isometric display. 
Bob Spinrad of Xerox Data Systems has a 
patent on displaying 3D from a *omputer through 
an ordinary color TV. Assuming you're using 
some standard way of refreshing the TV-- des­
cribed elsewhere-- the image for one eye is dis­
played in green. the other in red, and you look 
through red and fcreen glasses. The wonders of 
modern science. Spinrad chuckles over It him­
self. 
Another scheme glued silver Mylar to the 
front of a loudspeaker, then played a soft hum 
through the loudspeaker to pulse the Mylar back 
and forth. Then you used that as a mirror to 
look at what was going on the CRT-- which was 
showing a lot of points at odd places that would 
appear to be in space. Unfortunately this was 
hard to coordinate, and, like the propellor, 
often required you to put dots in several places 
at once, which don't work. 
For a while you could get— maybe you 
still can— a three-dimensional computer output 
device. Here's what it did: it created objects 
showing data structures that had three variables. 
(It didn't make wire-frame objects or the like.) 
Automatically ejecting wire through a styrofoam 
block, and snipping the done ones, it created 
little mountains showing three-dimensional data. 
Very cute. Since many people have problems 
with mountainous computer data, it probably 
should have caught on. 
Then a lot of people mumble the word 
"holography," as if that is going to settle some­
thing. While holograms are terrific and remark­
able, and have been produced on computers, 
making them is not a process that can be carried 
out decently on sequential machines— let alone 
making them in real time. So if a solution to 
interactive three-dimensional computer display 
is going to come through holography, it means 
a whole new batch of technology will have to be 
invented. 
My friend Andrew J. Singer, who comes 
and goes in the computer field and is one of 
the five or six smartest people I ever met, says 
he knows how to build a display tank, and I 
believe him. He explained it quickly to me once 
and I asked him to tell it again, but he just said 
sadly, "What's the use-- there are so many 
great things that could be done..." 
FOUR DIMENSIONS, EGAD 
So much for three dimensions. Now, some 
readers are bound to ask, "What about four dim­
ensions?" because they are science-fiction fans 
or troublemakers or mathematicians or something. 
Just as we can make a two-dimensional 
picture of a three-dimensional object, it is pos­
sible, dear reader, to make a two-dimensional 
picture of a four-dimensional object. 
What is a four-dimensional object? 
Why, any object that has four dimensions, 
(thanks a lot, you say), or even four measurable 
qualities, such as height, weight, age and grade 
point average. Well, let's not get into that, but 
it turns out that views of such multidimensional 
structures may be obtained by the same homogen­
eous matrix techniques already mentioned for 
regular perspective calculations. Rule of thumb: 
however many dimensions your data has originally, 
you add one more dimension, homogeneous with 
the rest, and there exist formulas (sorry, I don't 
have them) for view calculation. 
(Note, of course, that while a two-dimen­
sional view is a picture, a three-dimensional 
view is a three-dimensional object-- you'll have 
to view it on an interactive 3D computer display 
of some kind.)

It is usually hard to combine things: 
especially complicated technical things. 
Usually it takes infinite reconsiderations, 
finagling, modification, intertwingling. 
The Circle Graphics Habitat, however, 
is something else again. It results from 
two intricate, independent technological 
developments, each an intricate system care­
fully crafted by an exceptionally talented 
person, coming together like two hands clap-
ing. Like ham and eggs, like man and woman, 
Sandin's Image Processor and DeFanti's GRASS 
language conjoin directly and interact per­
fectly as if they had been made for each 
other, which they were not. 
Dan Sandin's Image Processor (see p.J>M&) 
is a system of circuit boxes that allow 
video images to be dynamically colored, mat­
ted, dissolved and palpitated; Tom DeFanti's 
language (see "Coup de GRASS, p.j)^'3l) per­
mits the rapid creation, viewing and manip­
ulation of three-dimensional objects on the 
screen of a particular computer setup. 
To combine them, you just point Dan's 
system at Tom's system. 
Let's say that on the screen of Tom's 
system we are viewing an animated bird, 
flapping its wings. Since it's being shown 
on a three-dimensional refreshed line display 
(see pp-iUZT-S.iAJ") , it appears only as white 
lines on a dark screen. 
Dan merely points a TV camera at Tom's 
screen, and runs the TV signal into his Im­
age Processor. Now, in the Image Processor, 
he gives it the magic of color. Different 
colors, interplaying with gradations and 
subtlety. 
From the Image Processor, the finished 
signal goes out to videotape recorders. 
What then have we overall? One of the 
world's most flexible facilities for the 
rapid production of educational videotapes. 
To explain something, you create a 
three-dimensional stick-figure "model" of it, 
using DeFanti's GRASS language. Then you 
make a videotape of it, showing rotations or 
other manipulations, using the Image Proces­
sor to give it color. 
DeFanti and Sandin have spent much of 
the academic year '73-4 getting the kinks out 
of this procedure. (Many of the difficulties 
stem from the unreliability of videotape re­
corders.) Stills from some of the first work 
are shown here.

Uneducated people typically think of 
education as the learning of a lot of facts 
and skills. While facts and skills certainly 
have their merits, "higher education" is also 
largely concerned with tying ideas together, 
and especially alternative structures of such 
tying-together: with showing you the vast un­
certainties of things. 
A wonderful Japanese film of the fifties 
was called Rasho-Mon. It depicted a specific 
event-- a rape-- as told by five different 
people. As the audience watches the five se­
parate stories, they must try to judge what 
really happened. 
The Rasho-Mon Principle: everything is 
like that. The complete truth about something 
is never known. 
Nobody tells the complete truth, though 
some try. Nobody knows the complete truth. 
Nowhere may we find printed the complete truth. 
There are only different views, assertions, 
supposed facts that support one view or another 
but are disputed by disbelievers in the particu­
lar views; and so on. There are "agreed-on 
facts," but their meaning is often in doubt. 
The great compromise of the western world 
is that we go by the rule: assume that we never 
know the final truth about anything. There are 
continuing Issues, Mysteries, Continuing Dia­
logues . What about flying saucers, "why Rome 
fell," was there a Passover Plot, and Did Roose­
velt know Pearl Harbor would be attacked? 
Outsiders find the intellectual world pom­
pous , vague in its undecided issues, stuffy in 
its quotes and citations. But in a way these 
are the sounds of battle. The clash of theories 
is what many find exhilarating about the intel­
lectual world. The Scholarly Arena is simply 
a Circus Haximus in which these battles are sche­
duled. 
Many people think "science" is free from 
all this. These are people who do not know much 
about science. More and more is scientifically 
known, true; but it is repeatedly discovered that 
some scientific "knowledge" is untrue, and this 
problem is built into the system. The important 
thing about science is not that everything will 
be known, or that everything unanimously believ­
ed by scientists is necessarily true, but that 
science contains a systern for seeking untruth 
and purging it. 
This is the great tradition of western 
civilization. The Western World is, in an 
important sense, a continuing dialogue among 
people who have thought different things. 
"Scholarship" is the tradition of trying to 
improve, collate and resolve uncertainties. 
The fundamental ground rules are that no issue 
is ever closed, no interconnection is impossible. 
It all comes down to what is writ ten, because 
the thoughts and minds themselves, of course, do 
not last. (The apparatus of citation and foot­
note are simply a combination of hat-tipping, 
go-look-if-you-don't-believe-me, and you-might-
want-to-read-this-yourself.) 
"Knowledge," then-- and indeed mos t of our 
civilization and what remains of those previous--
is a vasty cross-tangle of ideas and evidential 
materials, not a pyramid of truth. So that pre­
serving its structure, and improving its accessi­
bility, is important to us all. 
Which is one reason we need hypertexts and 
*hinkertoys. kt1

I &OS I 
I MM As Ear as I can tell, these are the techniques used 
by bright people who want to learn something other than 
by taking couraea in it. It's the way Ph.D.'a pick up 
a second field; it's the way journalists and "geniuses" 
operate) it brings the general understandings of a field 
that children of eminent people in that field get as a 
birthright! it's the way anybody can learn anything, if 
he has the nerve. 
1. DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO LEARN. But you can't 
know exactly, because of course you don't know exactly 
how any field is structured until you know all about it. 
0*1 iT, 
2. READ EVERYTHING YOU CAN * especially what you 
enjoy, since that way you can read more of it and faster. 
3. GRAB FOR INSIGHTS. Regardless of points others 
are trying to make, when you recognize an insight that has 
meaning for you, make it your own. It may have to do with 
the shape of molecules, or the personality of a specific 
emperor, or the quirks of a Great Man in the Pield. Its 
importance is not how central it is, but how clear and in­
teresting and memorable to you. REMEMBER IT. Then go for 
another. 
4. TIE INSIGHTS TOGETHER. Soon you will have your 
own string of insights in a field, like the string of lights 
around a Christmas tree. 
5. CONCENTRATE ON MAGAZINES, NOT BOOKS. Magazines 
have far more insights per inch of text, and can be read 
nuch faster. But when a book really speaks to you, lavish 
attention onft. 
6. FIND YOUR OWN SPECIAL TOPICS, AND PURSUE THEM. 
7. GO TO CONVENTIONS. For some reason, conventions are 
a splendid concentrated way to learn things; talking to people 
helps. Don't think you have to be anybody special to go to a 
convention; just plunk down your money. But you have to have 
a handle. Calling yourself a Consultant is good; "Student" is 
perfectly honorable. 
8. "FIND YOUR MAN." Somewhere in the world is someone 
who will answer your questions extraordinarily well. If you 
find him, dog him. He may be a janitor or a teenage kid; no 
matter. Follow him with your begging-bowl, if that's what he 
wants, or take him to expensive restaurants, or whatever. 
9. KEEP IMPROVING YOUR QUESTIONS. Probably in your 
head there are questions that don't seem to line up with 
what you're hearing. Don't assume that-you don't understand; 
keep adjusting the questions till you can get an answer that 
relates to what you wanted. 
10. YOUR FIELD IS BOUNDED WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE. 
Just because others group and stereotype things in convention­
al ways does not mean they are necessarily right. Intellectual 
subjects are connected every whichway; your field is what you 
think it is. (Again, this is one of the.things that will give 
you insights and keep you motivated; but it will get you into 
trouble if you try to go for degrees.) 
There are limitations. This doesn't give you lab ex­
perience, and you will continually have to be making up for 
gaps. But for alertness and the ability to use his mind, 
give me the man who's learned this way, rather than been 
blinkered and cliched to death within the educational system.

being an examination of some very Complex Hatters 
which Nobody Seems to Understand; and whose 
Generality of Relevance may be Gradually Apprehended. 
(Eventually I hope to develop a somewhat more formal 
treatment of "ideas," as distinct from propositions, 
sentence kernels, etc. But there is certainly no room 
for that here. (Logicians! show me the truth-table of 
"BUT.") 
The process of writing is poorly understood in most quarters. 
Many working writers despair of being "systematic," getting 
things done as best they can. On the other hand, people who think 
they might be able to contribute-- particularly the symbolic logi­
cians and transformational linguists— being immersed in their own 
formalisms, simply don't see what's going on— at least, when I've 
tried to talk to them. 
Writing is not simple. As with vision or speech or riding a 
bicycle, an immensely complex process is being unconsciously pur­
sued. 
Some people think you make an outline and follow it, filling 
out the details of the outline until the piece is finished. This 
is absurd. (True, some people can do this, but that is simply a 
shortcutting of the real process.) Basically writing is 
THE TRY-AND-TRY-AGAIN INTERPLAY of PARTS AND DETAILS against 
OVERALL AND UNIFYING IDEAS WHICH KEEP CHANGING. 
In fact a number of things are happening, often simultaneously. 
We can separate them into three: 
1. Provisional development of ideas and points: 
A) forming overall organizing ideas, B) selecting ten­
tative points; C) inductively finding overall organiza­
tion among them; D) finding relations of interest between 
points. 
2. Complex sifting and adjustment among collections of points, 
overall ideas. 
3. Fine splicing within developed sequences. 
A) transition and juxtaposition managements, B) cross-
citations, C) smoothing. 
Regrettably, there's no room or time to pursue this here. 
{The article I had intended to write would take a whole spread.) 
For people who really care about the matter, I will make some 
points in very abbreviated form. 
The interesting structures in written material include: 
"Points"— pieces, sentences, phrases, examples, plot events, 
and expository "points." 
Organizing principles and structures (which we will call here 
arches)— final ironies, things to be led up to, themes, 
plots, concepts, principles, expository structures, -or­
ganizing titles, overconcepts. These may be either local 
or global, over the entire work. (Note: arches may not 
be heirarchical relative to one another.) 
Now, we may think of points and arches as individual objects 
which have individual relations to one another. Between two points 
there, may be a good transition; a specific point may link well to a 
specific arch. 
The problem in writing, then, is that overall structures you 
choose (systems of arches) may not link well to the points that 
have to be included among them; and that transitions between points 
don't work out the way you want them to. Good transitions can't be 
worked out for the sequence of points you want to make, or, alter­
natively, there are too many good transitions within a specific 
structure of points, and picking among them involves difficult 
choices— especially when you have to devise appropriate arches on 
the basis of the final sequence of points. 
There are a number of other important structures in written 
material. They include accordances, juxtapositions, cross-citations, 
connotations, nuances and rhythms. 
The only ones we will discuss here are accordances. 
The term "accordance," as I shall use it here, is simply a 
vaguely formal way of talking about whether things match or fit 
together. Two items are in accord if they match or fit well, or in 
discord if they match or fit badly. Thus a good transition between 
points (as mentioned early) represents an accord, and a good link 
between a point and an arch is also an accord. unlcation-- whether written or snoken < ...

Now, it happens that a great deal of writing is concerned with 
notes to the reader about accordances in the material. In fact, 
quite a few words are exclusively concerned with subtly pointing out 
to the reader the accords and discords within the expository structure 
of what he is reading. We may call these accordance-connectives or 
accordance-notes. 
Two of the i ; basic terms are Indeed and but. 
The word indeed has an interesting function. 
The word indeed (in its main use, at the beginning of a sentence) 
indicates an accord between what has just been said and what is to 
follow. In other words, it functions as a positive transition, impe­
tus or gas pedal, indicating a continuation of the flow in the direction 
already indicated. So do the words thus, then, therefore, moreover, so 
and furthermore• These are infix accords, that is, notes of accord 
that go between two items. We also see prefix accords, such as 
since. Inasmuch as, insofar as; these have to be followed by 
two clauses, the second of which is in accord with the first. 
The word but is exactly the opposite. It indicates a discord or 
contradistinction, a negative transition, "brakes" in the flow, other 
such infix discords include nevertheless, despite this, on the other 
hand, even so, and "Actually,.••" Similarly, there are prefix dis­
cords: while, despite, though•.., notwithstanding• 
I find this topic of inquiry very interesting. These sorts of 
terms have been used since time immemorial by writers adjusting their 
transitions for smooth flow (note such antiquey variants as haply, 
howbeit, withal, forasmuch and howsomever), but the importance and 
structure of this service has not, I think, been generally understood. 
(Note also that there are more intricate accordance-connectives: 
I wish we could go here into the structure of h F*g|-..j st least, 
.. .if_ not... , ... otherwise... , Anyway... , and Now....) 
(Note: the try-and-try-again revision and reconsideration process, 
tinkering with structural interconnections, is a universal component 
of the creative process in everything from movie editing to machine 
design. There ought to be a name for it. I can't think of a satisfac­
tory one, although I would commend to your attention grandesignlng, 
piece-whole diddlework, grand fuddling, meta-mogrification, and 
that most exalted possibility, tagnebulopsis (the visualization of 
structure in clouds).) 
The past is like the receding view out the back 
of an automobile: the most recent is more conspicuous, 
and everything seems eventually to be lost. 
We know we chould save things, but what? Those 
with the job of saving things— the libraries and mu­
seums— save so many of the wrong things, the fashionable 
and expensive and high-toned things esteemed by a given 
time, and most of the rest slips past. Each generation 
seems to ridicule the things held in esteem by times be­
fore, but of course this can never be a guide to what 
should be saved. And there is so much to save: music, 
writing, sinking Venice, vanishing species. 
But why should things be saved? Everything is 
deeply intertwingled. We save for knowledge and nos­
talgia, but what we thought was knowledge often turns 
to nostalgia, and nostalgia often brings us deeper in­
sights that cut across our lives and very selves.* 
Computers offer an interesting daydream: that we 
may be able to store things digitally instead of 
physically. In other words, turn the libraries to digi­
tal storage (see Hypertexts, pVsH); digitize paintings 
and photographs (see "Picture Processing, p.»*|0);even 
digitize the genetic codes of animals, so that species 
can be restored at future dates (see "The Hitiest Com­
puter," p. to). 
Digital storage possesses several special advantages. 
Digitally stored materials may be copied by automatic 
meanB; corrective measures are possible, to prevent errors 
from creeping In— i.e., "no deterioration" In principle; 
and they could be kept in various places, lessening man­
kind's dependence on its eggs being all in one basket (like 
the Library at Alexandria, whose burning during the occupa­
tion of Julius Caesar was one of the greatest losses in 
human history). 
But this would of course require far more compact 
and reliable forms of digital storage than exist right now. 
Nevertheless, we better start thinking about it. 
ThoBe who fear a coming holocaust (see p. M ) had best think 
about pulling some part of mankind through, with some part of 
what he used to have.

In recent years a very basic change has occurred in 
presentational systems of all kinds. We may summarize It 
EnSer the name branching, si though there are many variants 
unaer ti.c _ , ms for presenting pictures, texts 
Essentially, today's systems for P- . ~ . 
and whaWot can bring you different things automatically 
depending on what you do Selection of this type is gencr-
"TVvcalled branching. (I have suggested the generic term 
hynermedia for presentational media which perform in this 
(and other) multidimensional ways.) 
A number of branching media exist or are possible. 
Branching movies or hyperfilms (see nearby). 
Branching texts or hypertexts (see nearby). 
Branching audio, music, etc. 
Branching slide-shows. 
Wish we could get into some of that stuff here. 
The idea of branching movies is quite exciting. 
The possibility of it is another thing entirely. 
The only system I know of that worked was at the 
1967 Montreal World's Fair (Expo 67). At the Czech 
Pavilion— you will recall that before the crackdown 
they had quite a yeasty culture going in Czechoslovakia— 
there were some terrific fantic systems going. One was 
a wall of cubes with slide projectors inside (that roll­
ed toward you and back as they changed their pictures). 
And then the Movie. 
The Czechoslovak!an Branching Movie— I forget its 
real name— had the audience vote on what was to happen 
next at a number of different junctures. What should 
she do now, what will he do next, etc. And lo and behold! 
after they had voted, the lights went down, and that's 
what would happen next. People agreed that this gave 
the movie a special immediacy. 
I never saw the movie— I waited in line several 
hours but the line was too long to get into the last show­
ing. So instead 1 went backstage and talked to Radusz Cin-
cera, who worked out the system. It turns out that it 
didn't work quite the way people supposed. A lot of people 
thought that "all the possibilities" had been filmed in ad­
vance. Actually, there were always only two possibilities, 
and no matter what the audience had chosen, somehow the film 
was plotted to come down to the same next choice anyway: 
In the actual setup, they simply had two projectors 
running side by side, with Film A and Film B, and the 
projectionist would drop an opaque slide in front of 
whichever wasn't chosen. But Cincera said that aud­
iences almost always chose the same alternatives anyway, 
so half the movie was hardly ever used 
In the early sixties a movie was making the rounds 
in which audiences were supposedly allowed to vote on the 
ending— "Mr. Sardonicus," I believe it was called. From 
the ads it seemed that audiences would be polled as to 
which last reel to show. Whether the villain was to get 
his comeuppance, or whatever. 
Then there was that Panacolor cartridge projector, 
mentioned elsewhere, which would have allowed choices by 
the user 
More recently there's the CMX system, also mentioned 
elsewhere. This is a setup, being jointly marketed by 
CBS and Memorex, for computer-controlled movie editing. 
But actually it could also be used as a branching movie sy­
stem. Essentially the movie itself is stored frame-by-
frame (as video) on big disks, made by Memorex; and, under 
computer control, the output can be switched rapidly among 
the frames, effectively showing the stored movies. (To my 
knowledge, the video networks haven't yet recognized the 
possibilities of this.) 
The only trouble is, it's extremely expensive (half a 
million?), it has an exact storage capacity limited by the 
number of disk tracks (presumably one track per frame) 
perhaps five minutes total one one big unit, but you can 
buy more— and it can only give its full performance to 
one viewer at a time.) (Or t» (Vt .oU/t. hiWk Iwe-) 
It may be that the most practical branching movie 
system would be a cartridge movie viewer and a big stack of 
cartridges. When you make your choice, change the cart­
ridge. But of course that's not as much fun as having it 
happen automatically. REALITY IS OBSOLETE 
The idea that objective reality Is perceived by our senses, 
1s an obsolete concept. Old truisms like "seeing 1s believing", 
become much less believable as we become more aware that, the 
biological machinery of life Itself, transforms images of the 
physical world before we are made conscious of them. These 
biological mechanisms share many similarities in principle and 
in application, to other mechanisms observed in the natural 
environment and those invented for our own use. Since we are 
becoming more aware of the nature of perception and those 
mechanisms involved, now is the time to gain control of our­
selves and share more discretion 1n the operation-of our own 
biological machinery. He have entered the age of hyper-reality. 
Oay-to-day living provides only a limited variety of 
physical stimulus, and little Incentive to manipulate the 
physiological and psychological processing involved, Han's 
historical preoccupation with the need to maintain constant 
images of the physical world, is a product of his extreme 
orientation toward physical survival in a hostile environment. 
The current evolving society of leisure orientations removes 
this need for constant images and thereby enhances the opportunities 
for a more complete use of the sensory apparatus and those re­
lated brain functions. Many have turned to drugs or meditation. 
More specifically it is proposed here, that modern communications 
technology be employed as a "vehicle of departure" from this need 
for constant images, to bring about a more complete use of the 
human technology itself. Hyper-reality is the employment of 
technology other than the biological machinery, when used to 
affect the performance of the biological machinery beyond its 
own limitations. This is almost like making adjustments on a 
television set, except you are what's plugged in, and the con­
trols are outside your body, being part of whatever technology 
is interfaced to the body itself. As part of such a man-
machine interface you could extend your own mental processes, 
or if you should choose, you could just diddle with the dials. 
Hyper-reality is an opportunity to enhance the various qualities 
of the human experience. Reality is obsolete.

Now, in our time, we are turning Gutenberg 
around. The technology of movable type created 
certain structures and practices around the writ­
ten word. Now the technology of computer screen 
displays make possible almost any structures and 
practices you can imagine for the written word. 
So now what? 
For new forms of written communication am­
ong people who know each other, jump to "Engel-
bart" piece., nearby. 
To learn about new forms of multidimensional 
documents for computer screens, jump to "Hyper­
texts." 
Or just feel free to browse. 
By "hypertext" I mean non-sequential 
writing. 
Ordinary writing is sequential for two 
reasons. First, it grew out of speech and 
speech-making, which have to be sequential; 
and second, because books are not convenient 
to read except in a sequence. 
But the structures of ideas are not se­
quential. They tie together every whichway. 
And when we write, we are always trying to 
tie things together in non-sequential ways 
(see p.JIr^HL). The footnote is a break from 
sequence; but it cannot really be extended 
(though some, like Will Cuppy, have toyed 
with the technique). 
I have run into perhaps a dozen people 
who understood this instantly when I talked 
to them about it. Most people, however, act 
more bemused, thinking I'm trying to tell them 
something technical or pointlessly philosoph­
ical. It's not pointless at all: the point is, 
writers do better if they don't have to write 
in sequence (but may create multiple struc­
tures, branches and alternatives), and readers 
do better if they don't have to read in seq­
uence, but may establish impressions, jump 
around, and try different pathways until they 
find the ones they want to study most closely. (The astute reader, and anybody who's gotten 
to this point must be, will have noticed that 
this book is in ''magazine" layout, organized 
visually by ideas and meanings, for that pre­
cise reason. I will be interested to hear 
whether that has worked.) 
And the pity of it is that (like the man 
in the French play who was surprised to learn 
that he had been "speaking prose all his life 
and never known it"), we've been speaking 
hypertext all our lives and never known it. 
Now, many writers have tried to break 
away from sequence. I think of" Nabokov's 
Pale Fire, of Tristram Shandy and an odd novel 
of Lazaro Cortazar called Hopscotch, made up 
of sections ending with numbers telling you 
where you can branch to. There are many more; 
and large books generally use many tricks to 
get around the problem of indexing and review­
ing what has and hasn't been said or done al­
ready . 
However, in my view, a new day is dawning. 
Computer storage and screen display mean that 
we no longer have to have things in sequence; 
totally arbitrary structures are possible, and 
I think that after we've tried them enough 
people will see how desirable they are.

TVPES OF HYPERTEXT 
Let's assume that you have a high-P""" 
display-- and storage displays won t do, be-
„u« you have to see things move in order 
to understand where they come-from and what 
they mean. (Especially text.) So it has to 
be a refreshed CRT. 
Basic or chunk style hypertext offers 
choiHiTT"erther as TSoTHote-markers (like 
asterisks) or labels at the end of a chunk. 
Whatever you point at then comes to the screen. 
Collateral hypertext means compound an-
notations or parallel text (see p. >,</*-). 
Stretchtext changes continuously. This 
reauires very unusual techniques (see p.WT.J. 
bC? exemplifies how "continuous" hypertext might 
work. 
Ideally, chunk and continuous and collateral 
hypertext could all be combined (and in turn col­
laterally linked; see "Th inkertoys p.*)*,?*-)-
A "fresh" or "specific" hypertext-- I don't 
have a better term at the moment-- would consist 
of material especially written for some purpose. 
An anthological hypertext, however, would consist 
of materials brought together from all over, like 
an anthological book. 
A grand hypertext, then, folks, would be 
a hypertext consisting of "everything" written 
about a subject, or vaguely relevant to it, 
tied together by editors (and NOT by "prog­
rammers," dammit), in which you may read in 
all the directions you wish to pursue. TTTere 
can be alternative pathways Tor people who 
think different ways. People who have to 
have one thing explained to them at a time--
many have insisted to me that this is normal, 
although I contend that it is a pathological 
condition-- may have that; others, learning 
like true human beings, may gather and sift im­
pressions until the ideas become clear. 
And then, of course, you see the real 
dream. 
The real dream is for "everything" to tie 
in the hypertext. 
.Everything you read, you read from the 
screen (and can always get back to right away); 
everything you write, you write at the screen 
(and can cross-link to whatever you read; see 
Canons, p.th). 
Paper moulders. Microfilm is inconvenient. 
In the best libraries it takes at least min- ' 
utes to get a particular thing. But as to 
linking them together-- footnoting Aeschylus 
with Marcus Aurelius, linking genetic data 
to 15th-century accounts of Indian tribes--
well, you can only do it on paper by writing 
something new that ties them together. Isn't 
that ridiculous? When you could do it all 
electronically in seconds? 
Now that we have all these wonderful de­
vices, it should be the goal of society to put 
them in the service of truth and learning. 
And this is the way I propose. Not through 
obscure forms of "information retrieval;" not 
through newly oppressive forms of "computer^-
assisted instruction;" and not through a pur­
ported science of "artif icaTTTntel 1 igence" 
that will create new personalisms to irk us. 
All these obstructive oddities, I think, have 
developed as separate ideals because of the 
grand preposterosity of Professionalism that 
has created a world-wide cult of mutual incom­
prehensibility and disconnected special goals. 
Now we need to get everybody together again. 
We want to go back to the roots of our civil­
ization-- the ability, which we once had, for 
everybody who could read to be able to read 
everything. We must once again become a com­
munity of common access to a shared heritage. 
This was of course what Vannevar Bush 
said in 1945 (see ^f^Xr) , in an article every­
body cites but nobody reads. 
The hypertext solution in many ways ob­
viates some of these other approaches, and in 
addition retains and puts back together the 
great traditions of literature and scholarship, 
traditions based on the fact that dividing 
things up arbitrarily just generally doesn't 
work. 
EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. 
(The only way in which my views differ 
with those of Engelbart and Pask, I think is 
in the matter of structure and hierarchy. 
Uoth men generally assume that whatever 
natural hierarchy i.iay exist in particular 
subjects needs to be accentuated; I hold that 
all structures must be treated as totally ar­
bitrary, and any hierarchies we find are inter­
esting accidents.) CAN IT BE DONE? 
I dunno. 
Licklider, one of computerdom's Great Men 
estimated in 1965 that to handle all text by 
computer, and bring it out to screens, would 
cost no more than what we pay for all text 
handling now. (But of course there is the 
problem of what to do with the people whose 
lives are built around paper; that can't be 
taken up here.) 
The people who make big computers say 
that to got the big disk storage to hold great 
amounts of text, you have to get their biggest 
computers. Which is a laugh and a half. One 
IBM-style computer person pompously told me 
that for large-scale text handling the only 
appropriate machine was an IBM 360/67 (a shame­
fully large computer). Such people seem not 
to understand about minicomputers or the po­
tential of minicomputer networks-- using, of 
course, big disks. 
There are of course questions of relia­
bility, of "big brother" (see Canons, p. ), 
and so on. But I think these matters can be 
handled. 
The key is that people will pay for it. 
I am sure that if we can bring the cost down 
to two dollars an hour-- one for the local 
machine (more than a "terminal"), one for the 
material (including storage, transmission and 
copyrights)-- there's a big, big market. (And 
that's what the Xanadu network is about; see 
p. [H^V/.] My assumption is that the way to do 
this is not through big business (since all 
these corporations can see is other corpora­
tions); not through government (hypertext is 
not committee-oriented, but individualistic--
and grants can only be gotten through sesqui­
pedalian and obfuscatory pompizzazz); but 
through the byways of the private enterprise 
system. I think the same spirit that gave us 
McDonald's and kandy kolor hot rod accessories 
may pull us through here. (See Xanadu Network, 
p. 2>t\*7.) 
Obviously, putting man's entire heritage 
into a hypertext is going to take awhile. But 
it can and should be done.

THE BURNING BUSH 
In fact hypertexts were foreseen very 
clearly in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, Roosevelt's 
science advisor. When the war was in the bag, 
he published a little article on various groovy 
things that had become possible by that time. 
"As We May Think" (Atlantic Monthly, July, 
1945) is most notable for its clear description 
of various hypertext techniques-- that is, link­
ages between documents which may be brought rap­
idly to the screen according to their linkages. 
(So what if he thought they'd be on microfilm.) 
How characteristic of Professionalism. 
Bush's article has been taken as the starting 
point for the field of Information Retrieval 
(see p. ), but its actual contents have been 
ignored by acclamation. Information Retrieval 
folk have mostly done very different things, yet 
thought they were in the tradition. 
Now people are "rediscovering" the article. 
If there's another edition of this book I hope 
I can run it in entirety.

toUG- CHfiCiWT AND 
Douglas Engelbart Is a saintly man at 
Stanford Research Institute whose dream has 
been to make people smarter and bring them 
together. His system, on which millions of 
dollars have been spent, is a wonder and a 
glory. 
He began as an engineer of CRTs (see 
"Lightning in a Bottle," p.#16); but his 
driving thought was, quite correctly, that 
these remarkable objects could be used to 
expand man's mind and improve each shining 
hour. 
Doug Engelbart's vision has never been 
restricted to narrow technical issues. From 
the beginning his concern was not merely to 
plank people down at display consoles, but 
in the most profound sense to expand man's 
mind. "The Augmentation of Human Intellect," 
he calls it, by which he means making minds 
work better by giving them better tools to 
work with. 
An obvious example is writing: before 
people could write things down, men could 
only learn what they experienced or were 
told by others in person; writing changed 
all that. Within the computer-screen fra­
ternity, the next step Is obvious; screens 
can double and redouble our Intellectual 
capacities. But this is not obvious to every­
body. Engelbart, patiently Instructing those 
outside, came up with a beautiful example. 
To show what he meant by the Augmentation of 
Intellect, Engelbart tied a pencil to a brick. 
Then he actually made someone write with it. 
The result, which was of course dreadful, En­
gelbart solemnly put into a published report. 
Not yet being able to demonstrate the aug­
mentation of intellect, since he had as yet 
no system to show off, he had masterfully de­
monstrated the disaugmentation of intellect: 
what happens if you make man's tools for work­
ing out his thoughts worse instead of better. 
As this poor guy was with his brickified pen­
cil, explained Engelbart, so are we all among 
our bothersome, inflexible systems of paper. 
Starting small, Engelbart programmed up 
a small version of what most fans call "The 
Engelbart System" some ten years ago. One 
version has it that when it came to looking 
for grants, management thought he acted too 
kooky, and so assigned a Front Man to make 
Che presentation. But, as the story goes, 
the man from ARPA (see "Military...", p. ^f) 
pointed at Engelbart and said, "We want to 
back him." 
A small but dedicated group at SRI has 
built up a system from scratch. First they 
used little CDC 1700 minicomputers; then, 
various grants later, they were able to set 
up their own PDP-10, in which the system now 
resides, and from which lt reaches out ac­
ross the country. 
Doug calls his system NLS, or "oN-Line 
System." Basically it is a highly responsive, 
deeply-structured text system, feeding out to 
display terminals. From a terminal you may 
read anything you or others have written, and 
write with aa-yet-unmatched flexibility. 
The display terminals are all over. The 
project has gone national, though at great ex­
pense: through the ARPA net of computers, you 
can in principle become a user of NLS for 
something like $50,000 a year. THE "KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP" 
For a lucky fifty or so people, Engelbart's 
system is Home. Wherever they are— at Stan­
ford Research Institute or far away on the 
ARPAnet— a whole world of secretarial and 
communication services is at their fingertips. 
The user has but to call up through his dis­
play terminal and log on. At that point all 
his written files, and numerous files shared 
among the users, are at his fingertips. He 
may read, write, annotate the cross-link. 
(Engelbart's system has provision for col­
lateral structuring: see "Thinkertoys," p*. T2_.) 
He may send messages to others in the Workshop. 
He may open certain of his files to other 
people, and read those that iiave been opened 
to him. 
This all has a certain vagueness if you 
do not understand how bound you are today by 
paper— the problems of finding it, sorting 
it, looking things up. (If you write, that 
is, write a lot, you know all too well how 
intractable is paper, what a damned nuisance.) 
With a system like Engelbart's, now, whatever 
is written is instantly there. Whatever you 
want to look up Is instantly there, simultan­
eously interconnected to everything else lt 
should be connected to— source materials, 
footnotes, comments and so on. A document is 
completed the moment it is written: no human 
being has to retype it. (It need not be typed 
on paper at all, if it's just for the workshop 
members: a printout is only needed if it has 
to go to someone outside the system.) 
In many ways, Engelbart's system is a pro­
totype for the world of the future, I hope. 
ALL HANDLING OF PAPER IS ELIMINATED. Whatever 
you write, you write on the screens with key­
board and pointer. (No more backs of envelopes, 
yellow pads, file cards, typewriters.) What­
ever you transmit to fellow users of the system 
you simply 'release'— no physical papet changeB 
hands. 
The group has also worked out some remark­
able techniques for collaborative endeavor. 
Two people— say, one in California and one in 
New York— can work together through their 
screens, plus a phone link; it's as if they 
were side-by-side at a magic table. Each sees 
on his screen what the other sees; each controls 
a moving dot (or "cursor") that shows where he's 
pointing. The effect is somewhere between a 
blackboard and a desk; both may call up docu­
ments, point things out in them, change them, 
and anything else two people might do when work­
ing on something together. THE SYSTEM ITSELF 
Basically the system Is a large-scale setup 
for the storage, bringing forth, viewing and 
revision of documents and connections among them. 
The documents are stored (of course) In 
alphabetical codes. Connections among them, 
or other relations within them, are signalled 
by the presence of other codes within them; 
these are ordinarily not displayed, however, 
except as directed by a particular diaplay 
program and display programs can of course 
va ry. 
There are various programs for display, 
in large part depending on what sort of 
screen system the Individual user has. 
(NLS is used with everything from high-reso­
lution line-drawing screens converted to 1000-
line television, down to inexpensive Delta 
Data terminals— a brand, incidentally, that 
allows text motion, which most don't^ Engel­
bart's system is extremely general, allowing 
the creation of files having all kinds of 
structures, and display programs in all kinds 
of Btyles. (I hope that this side of the pre­
sent book conveys a sense of how many styles 
that can be.) However, most users are devoted 
to certain standardized styles of working that 
have been well worked out and permit the easy 
sharing of material and of operating practices. 
Here, for instance, is standard screen layout: 
k,rr 
Engelbart meets with someone 
far away t as othere watch. Two separate panels of text appear, and links 
may be shown on them. (Thus it's a thinkertoy— 
see p. .) Two little windows at the top re­
mind you of what you're seeing and what you're 
asking for. We can't get into the rest of it 
here 
THE COMMAND LANGUAGE 
NLS has a command language which all 
users must learn. While it is a stream­
lined and straightforward command language, 
nevertheless It requires the user to type 
in a specific sequence of alphabetical 
characters every time he wants something 
done. (This Is acceptable to computer-
oriented people; I suspect it would not 
be satisfactory, say, for philosophers 
and novelists. For designs oriented to 
such users, see JOT (p.*K5"0 ) and Carmody's 
System, nearby, Parallel Textface (p?*1?}) 
and,Th3 (p.^ST).) 
Incidentally, NLS users may also employ 
a cute little keyboard, something like a 
kalimba, that allows you to type with one 
hand. You simply type the six significant 
ASCII bits (see chart p. £J?) in one "chont" 
— it sounds hard but is easy to learn. 
Sample commands: I (insert), D (delete), 
M (move or rearrange). Then you point with 
the mouse. 
HOUSE? 
The Engelbart Folks have built a pointing 
device, for telling the system where you're 
pointing on the screen, that is considerably 
faster and handier than a lightpen. (Unfor­
tunately, I don't believe it's commercially 
available.) It's called The Mouse. 
The Engelbart Mouse is a little box with 
hidden wheels underneath and a cable to the 
terminal. As you roll it, the wheel's turns 
are signalled to the computer and the comput­
er moves the cursor on the screen. It s fast 
and accurate, and in fact beats a lightpen 
hands down in working speed. 
Through the command language, NLS allows 
users to create programs that respond In all 
sorts of ways; thus the fact that certain text-
handling styles are standard (as In above il­
lustration of screen layout) results more from 
tradition than necessity. 

--- Page 51 ---

The sane apparently la true of the data 
structure. 1 used to be somewhat disturbed 
at che way Engelbart's text systems seen to 
be rigorously hierarchical. This in fact la 
the case, in the sense that having multiple 
discrete levels Is built deep into the system. 
But it turns out to be harmless. The stored 
text ie divided by the storage techniques in­
to multiple levels, corresponding to a Harvard 
outline. Think of it as something like this: 
1. HIERARCHICAL FORMAT 
A. STORAGE 
B. DISPLAY 
C. LANGUAGE 
But let's expand this example a little: 
1. HIERARCHICAL FORMAT 
A. STORAGE 
Al. Everything in NLS is stored 
with hierarchical codes. 
A2. Their effect depends on the 
display. 
B. DISPLAY 
Bl. The hierarchical codes of 
NLS have no consequences in 
particular. 
B2. The hierarchical codes for 
NLS can splay the material 
out into a variety of dis­
play arrangements. 
B2A. They can be displayed 
in outline form. 
B2B. They can be displayed 
in normal text form. 
B2C. These dratted numbers 
can even be made to 
disappear. 
C LANGUAGE 
Cl. The command language deter­
mines what the display shows 
of the hierarchical structure, 
C2. What is shown can be deter­
mined by a program in the 
command language. (For in­
stance, "how many levels 
down" it is being shown). 
C2A. This is four levels 
down. (The earlier 
example wasn't.) 
C3. The display format all de­
pends on what display pro­
gram you use, in the NLS 
command language. 
That's enough of that. I can't help re­
marking that I still don't like that sort of 
structuring, but It is deep in NLS, and if 
you don't like it either (poor deprived lucky 
user of NLS) you can program it to disappear, 
so it s hardly in your way. 
BY THE BEARD OF THE PROPHET! 
Engelbart in German means Angelbeard; Doug 
Engelbart is indeed on the aide of the angels. 
In building his mighty system he points a new 
way for humanity. The sooner the better. Any 
history of the twentieth century will certainly 
hold him high. Few great men are also such 
nice guys.

The Augmentation of Inte Hypertext Is non-sequential writing. It's no good to us, 
though, unless we can go instantly in a choice of directions 
from a given point. 
Thia of course i i computer diaplay 
Engelbart's system, now, was mainly designed for people who 
wanted to immerse themselves in lt and learn lta conventions. 
Indeed, it might b« said to have been designed for a community 
of people in close contact, a sort of system of blackboards and 
collaborative talking papers. 
A more elemental system, with a different slant, was put 
together at Brown U. on IBM equipment. We'll refer to it here 
as "Carmcdy'a Syatem," after the young programmer whose name 
came first on the writeup. 
Carmody'a syatem runs on an IBM 360 with 2250 display. 
While the 2250 is s fine piece of equipment, the quirks of the 
360'» operating system (see p. fC ) often delay the user by 
making him wait, e.g., for someone else's cards to get punched 
before it responds to his more immediate usesi this is like 
making ice-skaters wait for oxcarts. 
Anyway, the system essentially Imposes no structure on 
the material) it may consist of text segments of any length 
and ties and links between them. An asterisk appearing any­
where in one piece of text signals a possible Jump, but the 
reader doesn't necessarily know where toi sapping the asterisk 
with the lightpen takes you there, however. 
ted Thia ia stark and simple. It could also get you good 
and lost. However, a simple technique took care of that: 
every/time the user jumped, the address of his previous 
location was saved on a stack (see "The Magic of the Stack," 
p. . The user also had a RETURN button: when he wanted 
to go back to where he had last jumped from, the system 
would pop the last address off the top of the stack, and 
take him there. (This feature was adapted from my 1967 
Stretchtext paper, and turned out to work out quite well 
in practice.) 
The system also had handy features for light-pen text 
editing, and various nice printout techniques. All told, 
it was a clean and powerful design. While it lacked higher-
level visualization facilities, like Engelbart's display of 
Levels (see "outline" in Engelbart article) or collateral 
display (see "Thinkertoys," p.D*\rz), it was in some way: 
for naive users; that is, it was eventually fairly safe to use. 
and could in large part be taught to rank beginners in a couple 
of hours— provided they didn't have to know about JCL cards. 
It is left for the reader to figure out interesting uses 
for it. How would you do collateral structures? How could 
you signal to a reader which of several pieces of text a jump 
was to? 
(At least one real hypertext was actually written on this 
system. It tied together a lot of patents for multilayer elec­
trodes. Readers agreed that they could learn more from it about 
multilayer electrodes than they had imagined wanting to know.)

This continues the remarks on Gordon Paek 
begun on p. 
I will npw try to describe Pask's work 
as he has explained it to me. Perhaps this 
will be of some help to those who may have 
been mystified or dumfounded by contact with 
this fabulous nan. 
Gordon Pask's concern is abstraction and 
how concepts are formed, whether in a creature 
of nature or a robot or a computer program. 
Abstraction is of interest primordially (as life 
evolved thinking capacity), psychogenetically 
(as the mind acquires new facilities, described 
most peculiarly by Piaget), and epistemological-
ly (how do we know? Like, how do we know, man?), 
and methodologically (how can we most effectively 
find out more?). 
ills interest, then, is in teaching by 
allowing students to discover exact relations 
in a specific subject matter by the very pro­
cess of abstraction that is of so much interest. What he does, then. Is prepare given 
fields of learning so that they can be stydied 
by students using abstractive methods, without 
guidance. 
This preparation basically has two steps. 
First he sets up the whole field. This is 
done in collaboration with a "subject matter 
expert," who names the important topics in 
the field and states what interconnections 
they have. The result is a complex graph 
structure (see p. fj, ) which Pask cllls a 
conversational domain. It comes out to huge 
diagrams ot labels and lines between then. 
Tnen pask processes this structure to 
make a more usable map of the field that he 
calls an entailment structure. The processing 
basically involves removing "cycles" in the 
graph, thus making the structure hierarchical 
in a slightly artificial way justified by what 
the subject-matter-expert has said is the 
structure of the field. 
(This processing is carried out by a oro-
gram called EXTEND.) v 
The resulting Entailment Structure is 
then presented to the student as a great map 
of the field which he may explore. 
Pask intends that the student's explor­
ations.will consist of testing analogies, or 
what Pask calls morphisms, to find the exact 
structures of knowledge he is supposed tg 
be acquiring. This knowledge will be in the 
form of isomorphisms, or exact analogies, i.e. 
laws. 
Pask's overall systern,examples of which 
he has running in his laboratory in England, 
he calls CASTE (Course Assembly System and 
Tutorial Environment). A further development, 
which is to be put on a PDP-11/45 computer 
(see p. and p. IL ) at the Brooklyn Chil­
dren's Museum, is called THOUGHT-STICKER. 
This program is intended to allow the demon­
stration and testing of analogies directly, 
by children. 
% 
PASK AND HYPERTEXT 
Gordon Pask's work is remarkably similar 
to my own stuff on hypertext. 
Essentially Pask is reducing a field to 
an extremely formal structure of relations 
which may then be studied by_ the student, at 
the student's initiative. 
(What 1 don't quite understand is how the 
analogies are to be explored and tested.) 
Anyway, a principal point is that the 
student is in control and may use his initia­
tive dynamically; the subject is not artifi­
cially processed into a presentational se­
quence. Moreover, the arbitrary interconnec­
tions of the subject, which are no respecters, 
of the printed page, are recognized as the 
fundamental structures the student must deal 
with and come to understand. On all these 
points Pask and I are in total agreement. 
Indeed, his explorable systerns-- (I don't 
know if they will be what I elsewhere call 
hypergrams or responding resources)-- will be 
fascinating, fun and terrifically educational. 
Because he is. 
Now it turns out that this exactly com­
plements the notion of hypertext as 1 have been 
promulgating it lo these many years. 
Hypertext is non-sequential text. If we 
write a hypertext on something, it will be 
most appropriate iF~we give it the general 
interconnective structure of the field. In 
other words, the interconnective structures 
chosen for the textual parts are likely to have 
the same connective structure (in general) as 
Pask's Entailment Structure. 
For another kind of hypertext, the antho­
logical hypertext built up of lots of other 
writings, it is also reasonable to expect the 
connective structures to cluster to the same 
general form as Pask's entailment structure. 
In other words, the very same field of 
knowledge Pask is out to represent as an ex-
plorable, formalized whole, I am out to repre­
sent as an explorable Unformalized whole, with 
anecdotes, jokes, cartoons, "enrichment mater­
ials," and anything else people might dig. 
In still other words, let's have both 
and call it a party.

FANTICS

Ah, Lovel could you and I with Him compire 
To gratp this sorry Scheme of Tbingi entire. 
Would not we ihstter it to bits—snd then 
Re-mould it nearer to tbe Heart'* Desire I 
Edward Fitagerald. 
Almost everyone seems to agree that Mankind (who?) 
Is on the brink of a revolution in the way information 
Is handled, and that this revolution Is to come from 
some sort of merging of electronic screen presentation 
and audio-visual technology with branching, interactive 
computer systems. (The naive think "the" merging Is 
Inevitable, as If "the" merging meant anything clear. 
I used to think that too.) 
Professional people seem to think this merging will 
be an intricate mingling of technical specialties, that 
our new systems will require work by all kinds of commit­
tees and consultants (adding and adjusting) until the Re­
sults— either specific productions or overall Systems— 
are finished. Then we will have to Learn to Use Them. 
More consulting fees. 
I think this Is a delusion and a con-game. I think 
that when the real media of the future arrive, the small­
est child will know it right away (and perhaps first). 
That, Indeed, should and will be the criterion. When you 
can't tear a teeny kid away from the computer screen, 
we'll have gotten there. 
We are approaching a screen apocalypse. The author's 
basic view is that RESPONSIVE COMPUTER DISPLAY SYSTEMS 
CAN, SHOULD AND WILL RESTRUCTURE AND LIGHT UP THE MENTAL 
LIFE OF MANKIND. (For s more conventional outlook, see 
box nearby, "Another Viewpoint.") 
I believe computer screens can make people happier, 
smarter, and better able to cope with the copious prob­
lems of tomorrow. But only if we do right, right now. 
WHY? 
The computer's capability for branching among 
events, controlling exterior devices, controlling 
outside events, and mediating in all other events, 
makes possible a new era of media. 
Until now, the mechanical properties of exter­
nal objects determined what they were to us and how 
we used them. But henceforth this is arbitrary. 
The recognition of that arbitrariness, and re­
consideration among broader and more general alter­
natives, awaits us. All the previous units and 
mechanisms of learning, scholarship, arts, transac­
tion and confirmation, and even self-reminder, were 
based in various ways upon physical objects— the 
properdes of paper, carbon paper, files, books 
and bookshelves. To read from paper you must move 
the physical object in front of you. Its contents 
cannot be made to slide, fold, shrink, become trans­
parent, or get larger. 
But all this Is now changing, and suddenly. The 
computer display screen does all these things if desired, 
to the same markings we have previously handled on paper. 
The computer display screen is going to become universal 
very fast; this is guaranteed by the suddenly rising 
cost of paper. And we will use them for everything. 
This already happens wherever there are responding com­
puter screen systems. (I have a friend with two CRTs on 
his desk; one for the normal flow of work, and one to 
handle interruptions and side excursions.) A lot of 
forests will be saved. 
How, there are many people who don't like this idea, 
and huff about various apparent disadvantages of the 
screen. But we can improve performance until almost 
everyone is satisfied. For those who say the screens are 
"too small," we can improve reliability and backup, and 
offer screens everywhere (so that material need not be 
physically carried between them). 
The exhilaration and excitement of the coming time 
is hard to convey on paper. Our screen displays will be 
alive with animation in their separate segments of activ­
ity, and will respond to our actions as If alive physic­
ally too. 
The question is, then: HOW WILL WE USE THEM? Thus 
the design of screen performances and environments, and 
of transaction and transmission aystems, is of the high-
eat priority. 
THE FRENCH HAVE A WORD FOR IT 
In French they use the term 1'Informatique 
to mean, approximately, the presentation of ln-
formation to people by automatic equipment. 
Unfortunately the English equivalent, 
informatics. has been preempted. There is a 
computer programming firm called Informatics, 
Inc., and when I wrote them about this in the 
early sixties they said they did not want their 
name to become a generic term. Trademark law 
supports them in this to a certain extent. 
(Others, like Wally Feurzeig, want that to be 
the word regardless.) But in the meantime 
I offer up the term fantics, which is more 
general anyhow. What people don't sea is how computer technology now 
makes possible ths revision and improvement—- the trans­
formation— of all our madia. It "sounds too technical." 
But this is the basic misunderstanding: tha funda­
mental lasues are NOT TECHNICAL. To understand this is 
basically a matter of MEDIA CONSCIOUSNESS, not technical 
knowledge. 
A lot of people have acute media consciousness. But 
some people, like Pat Buchanan and the communards, suggest 
that there is something shabby about thla. Many think, 
indeed, that we live in a world of false Images promulgat­
ed by "media," a situation to be corrected. But this la 
a misunderstanding. Many Images are false or puffy, all 
right, but lt la Incorrect to suppose that there Is any 
alternative. Media have evolved from simpler forms, and 
convey the background Ideas of our time, as well as the 
fads. Media today focus the Impressions and Ideas that 
in previous eras were conveyed by rituals, public gather­
ings, decrees, parades, behavior in public, mummer' troup­
es...but actually every culture is a world of images. The 
chieftain in his palanquin, the shaman with his feathers 
and rattle, are telling us something about themselves and 
about the continuity of the society and position of the 
individuals in it. 
Now the media, with all their quirks, perform the 
same function. And if we do not like the way some things 
are treated by the media, in part this stems from not 
understanding how they work. "Media," or structured trans­
mission mechanisms, cannot help being personalized by 
those who run them. (Like everything else.) The problem 
is to understand how media work, and thus balance our un­
derstanding of the things that media misrepresent. 
THOUGHTS ABOUT MEDIA: 
1. ANYTHING CAN BE SAID IN ANY MEDIUM. 
Anything can be said in any medium,and Inspiration 
counts much more than 'science'. But the techniques which 
are used to convey something can be quite unpredictable. John B. Macdonsld

2. TRANSPOSABILITY 
There has always been, but now is newly, a 
UNITY OF MEDIA OPTIONS. You can get your message 
across in a play, a tract, a broadside, a textbook, 
a walking sandwich-board, a radio program, a comic 
book or fumettl, a movie, a slide-show, a cassette 
for the Audi-Scan or the AVS-10, or even a hypertext 
(see p.})»]%). 
(But transposing can rarely preserve completely 
the character or quality of the original.) 
3. BIG AND SMALL APPROACHES 
What few people realize is that big pictures can 
be conveyed in more powerful ways than they know. The 
reason they don't know it is that they see the content 
in the media, and not how the content Is being gotten 
across to them— that in fact they have been given very 
big pictures indeed, but don't know It. (I take this 
point to be the Nickel-Iron Core of HcLuhanlsm.) 
People who want to teach In terms of building up 
from the small to the large, and others who (like the 
author) like to present a whole picture first, then 
fill in the gaps, are taking two valid approaches. 
(We may call these, respectively, the Big Picture ap­
proach and the Piecemeal approach.) Big pictures are 
just as memorable as picky-pieces if. they have strong 
insights at their major intersections. 
<*. THE WORD-PICTURE CONTINUUM 
The arts of writing and diagramming are basically 
a continuum. In both cases the mental images and cogni­
tive structures produced are a merger of what is heard 
or received. Words are slow and tricky for presenting 
a lot of connections; diagrams do this well. But dia­
grams give a poor feel for things and words do this 
splendidly. The writer presents exact statements, in 
an accord-structure of buts and indeeds, molded In a 
structure of connotations having (if the writer la 
good) exact imprecisenesa. This is hardly startling: 
you're always selecting what to say, and the use of 
vague words (or the use of precise-sounding words va­
guely) is simply a flagrant form of omission. In dia­
grams, too, the choice of what to leave In and out, how 
to represent overweening condition*and forces and exemp­
lary details, are highly connotative. (Great diagrams 
are to be seen in the Scientific American and older 
Issues of TIME magazine.) 
This word-picture continuum is just a part of tbe 
broader continuum, which I call Fantics. PROBLEMS. PERILS, AMP PROMISES Qp COMPUTER QRAPH:™

By "fantics" I mean the art and science of getting 
ideas across, both emotionally and cognitlvely. "Presenta­
tion" could be a general word for It. The character of 
what gets acroas Is always dual: both the explicit struc-
ture^and feelings that go with them. These two aspects, 
exactness and connotation, are an Inseparable whole; what 
is conveyed generally has both. The reader or viewer al­
ways gets feelings along with information, even when the 
creators of the information think that its "content" Is 
much more restricted. A beautiful example: ponderous 
technical manuals which carry much more connotatlvely 
than the author realizes. Such volumes may convey to 
some readers an (Intended) impression of competence, to 
others a sense of the authors' obtusenees and non-imagina­
tion. Explicit declarative structures nevertheless have 
connotative fields; people receive not only cognitive 
structures, but impressions, feelings and senses of things. 
Fantics is thus concerned with both the arts of ef­
fect— writing, theater and so on—end the structures and 
mechanisms of thought, including the various traditions of 
the scholarly event (article, book, lecture, debate and 
class ). These are all a fundamentally Inseparable whole, 
and technically-oriented people who think that syatems to 
interact with people, or teach, or bring up information, 
can function on some "technical" basis— with no tie-ins 
to human feelings, psychology, or the larger social struc­
ture— are kidding themselves and/or everyone else. Sys­
tems for "teaching by computer," "information retrieval," 
and so on, have to be governed In their design by larger 
principles than most of these people are willing to deal 
with: the conveyance of images, impressions and Ideas. 
This is what writers and editors, movie-makers and lectur­
ers, radio announcers and layout people and advertising 
people are concerned with; and unfortunately computer 
people tend not to understand lt for beans. 
In fantics as a whole, then we are concerned with: 
1. The art and science of presentation. Thus it na­
turally includes 
2. Techniques of presentation: writing, stage dir­
ection, movie making, magazine layout, sound overlay, 
etc. and of course 
3. Media themselves, their analysis and design; 
and ultimately 
4. The design of systems for presentation. This 
will of course involve computers hereafter, both concept­
ually and technically; since It obviously Includes, for the 
future, branching and intricately Interactive systems en­
acted by programmable mechanisms, i.e. computers. Thus 
computer display, data structures (and, to an extent, 
programming languages and techniques) are all a part. 
Fantics must ale < include 
5. Psychological effect and impact of various presen­
tational techniques— but not particular formal aesthetics, 
as of haiku or musical composition. Where directly rele­
vant fantics also includes 
6. Sociological tie-inB— especially supportive and 
dysfunctional structures, such as tie-ins with occupational 
structure; sponsorship and commercials; what works in schools 
and why. Most profoundly of all, however, fantics must deal 
with psychological constructs used to organize things: 
7. The parts, conceptual threads, unifying concepts 
and whatnot that we create to make aspects of the world un­
derstandable. We put them into everything, but standard­
ize them in media. 
For example, take radio. Given in radio-- the tech­
nological fundament— is merely the continuous transmission 
of sound. Put into it have been the "program," the ser­
ial (and thus the episode), the announcer, the theme song 
and the musical bridge— conventions which are useful pre-
sentationally. 
The arbitrariness of such mental constructs should 
be clear. Their usefulness in mental organization perhspa 
is not. 
Let's take a surprise example, nothing electronic 
about it. 
Many "highways" are wholly fictitious— at least to 
begin with. Let's say that a Route 37 le created across 
the state: that number is merely a series of signs that 
users can refer to aa they look at their maps and travel 
along. 
However, as time goes by, "Route 37" takes on a cer­
tain reality as a conceptual entity: people think of it 
as a thing. People say "Just take 37 straight out" 
(though it may twist and turn); groups like a Route 37 
Merchants' Association, or even a Citizens to Save Scenic 
.37, may spring up. 
What was originally simply a nominal construct, then, 
becomes quite real as people organize their lives around 
lt. 
This all seems arbitrary but necessary in both high­
ways snd radio. What, then, does lt have to do with the 
new electronic media?

The older The highway-number analogy continues, 
highways had numbers for convenience, and our travels Be­
came organized around them, and particular highways (like 
"U.S. 1" and "Route 66") came to have special character. 
But now with the Interstatcs, a highway is a planned, 
sealed unit, no longer just a collection of roads gather­
ed together under a name. 
This unit, the Interstate, is not merely a psychologi­
cal construct, but a planned structure. Knowing what works 
and what doesn't in the design of fast highways, the Inter-
states were built for speed, structured as closed units. 
Designing them with limited access has been a conscious 
decision in the system design for well-based reasons, not, 
a chance structure brought in from horse-and buggy days. 
Now, the constructs of previous media— writing, films, 
other arts— evolved over time, and in many cases may have 
found their way to a "natural" form. But because of the 
peculiar way that computer media are currently evolving 
/—under large grants largely granted to professionals who 
use very large words to promote the idea that their origi­
nal professions are largely applicable— ), this sort of 
natural evolution may not take place. The new constructs 
of computer media, especially computer screen-media, may not 
have a chance to be thought out. We need designs for screen 
presentations and their mixture— vignetting, Windows, 
screen mosaics, transformed and augmented views, and the 
rapid androoprehensible control of these viewB and windows. 
We are still Just beginning to find clever viewing tech­
niques, and have hardly begun to discover highly respon­
sive forms of viewability and control (cf. collateration 
in "Thinkertoys," p.y»*2»), and Knowlton's button-box (^..jftj) 
(See T. Nelson, "A Conceptual Framework for 
Kan-Machine Everything," cited p. , and material on 
controls, below.) 
THE MIND'S UNIFICATION 
One of the remarkable things about the human mind 
is the way it ties things together. Perceptual unity 
comes out of nowhere. A bunch of irregular resi­
dential and Industrial blocks becomes thought of as "my 
neighborhood." A most remarkable case of mental uni­
fication Is afforded by the visage of our good friend 
Mickey Mouse. The character Is drawn in a most para­
doxical fashion: two globelike protrusions (representing 
the ears) are in different positions on the head, depend­
ing on whether we view him from the front or the side. 
No one finds this objectionable; few people even notice, 
it seems.

What this shows, of course, is the way the mind can 
unify into a consistent mental whole even things which 
are inconsistent by normal rules (in this case, the rules 
of three-dimensional structure). 
Even perceptions are subject to the same principle 
of unification. The fingernail is an excrescence with no 
nerves in it; yet somehow you can feel things with your 
flneernaila— tying together disparate sensations into 
a unified sense of something In the world (say, a coin 
you're trying to pick up). In the same way, an experienc­
ed driver feels the road; In a very real sense, the car's 
wheels and suspension become his own sensory extensions. 
This principle of mental unification is what makeb 
things come together, both literally and figuratively, 
in a fantic field. A viewer sees two consecutive movie 
shots of streets and unifies them Into one street; controls, 
if you are used to them, become a single fused system of 
options; we can have a sense of a greater whole, of which 
one view on a Bcreen is a part. 
IS NOT in ooR^.STMy 
CONTROLS: THEIR UNIFICATION AND FEEL 
Controls are intimately related to screen presenta­
tion, just as arbitrary, and just as important. 
The artful design of control systems is a deeply 
misunderstood area, in no way deconfused by calling it 
human factors." There are many functions to be control­
led, such as text editing operations, views of the uni­
verse on a screen, the heading of a vehicle, the tilt of 
an aircraft, the windage and adjustments of artillery 
the temperature of a stove burner and any other control­
lable devices. And nowadays any conceivable devices 
could control them— pushbuttons, knobs, cranks, wheels, 
leyers and joysticks, trigger, dials, magic wands, mani­
pulation by lightpen on CRT screens (see p.^Ti) flicks 
of the finger, the turning pX the eyes (as in some ex­
perimental gun-aiming devices), the human voice (but 
that introduces problems— see p.finrj), keyboards, elec­
tronic tablets, Bogelbart mice and chordwriters, and so The human mind being as supple aa lt is, anything 
whatever can be used to control systems. The problem is 
having it be s comprehensible whole. 
As already remarked, our ability mentally to unify 
things ia extraordinary. That we somehow tie together 
clutch, gear, accelerator and brake into a comprehensible 
control structure to mske cars go and stop should amaxe 
and Instruct. 
Engineers and "human factors" people apeak as though 
there were some kind of scientific or determinate way to 
design control systems. Piffle. We choose a set of con­
trols, much like an artist's Palette, on the baals of ge­
neral appropriateness; and then try best and moat artistic­
ally to fit them to what needs doing. 
The result must be conceptually clear and retroactive­
ly "obvious"— simply because clsrlty is the simplest way 
to keep the user from making mistakes. Clear and simple 
systems are easier to learn, harder to forget. Leas likely 
to be screwed up by the user, and thus are more economic­
al— getting more done for the resources put in. 
There ia a sort of paradox here. The kinds of con­
trols are totally arbitrary, but their unification in a 
good system is not. Smoothness and clarity can come from 
disparate elements. It is for this reason that I lay par­
ticular stress on my JOT system for the input and revision 
of text, using a palette of keys available on the simplest 
standard computer terminal, the 33 Teletype. I cannot 
make the final judgement on how good this system is, but 
it pleases me. JOT is also an important example because 
lt suggests that a conceptually unified system can be 
created from the artful non-obvious combination of loose 
elements originally having different intended purposes. 
Mental analogy is an important and clear control 
technique. We tend to forget that the steering wheel was 
Invented, separately replacing both the boat's tiller and 
the automobile's tiller. We also forget that the use of 
such steering mechanisms must be actually learned by 
children. Such continuous analogies, though, require cor­
responding continuities in the space to be controlled— 
an important condition. 
Simplicity and c 
appearance of contro] irity have nothing to do with the 
but with the clarity and unique 
stability of individual parts. For this reason I find 
deplorable the arrayed controls that are turning up, e.g. 
•n today's audio equipment. Designers seem to think 
rows of things are desirable. On the contrary: the best 
designed controls I ever used are on the Sony TC-50 
pocket tape recorder ^ 
'FKST' 
fair foeuAtj) 
but of course this is now phased out; instead most cassette 
recorders have five or six stupid buttons in a row. (Was 
it too good to last?) 
Spurious control elegance comes in many guises. Con­
sider Bruce McCall's description of the Tap-A-Toe Futuroi-
dic Footless De-Clutchingtm system. This was offered on 
the fictitious 1934 Bulgemobiles, and allowed you to drive 
the car with one pedal, rather than three (see box nearby). 
Careless and horrible designs are not all fictitious. 
One egregious example also Indicates the low level of de­
sign currently going into some responding systems: comput­
er people have designed CRT writing systems for newspapers 
which actually have a "kill" button on the console, by 
which authors would accidentally kill their stories. In 
a recent magazine article it was explained that the event­
ual solution was to change the program so that to kill 
the story you had to hit the "kill" button twice• To me 
this seems like a beautiful example of what happens when 
you let insulated technical people design the system for 
you: a "kill" button on the keyboard is about as intelli­
gent as installing knives on the dashboard of a car, 
pointing at the passenger. 
There is another poor tendency. When computer pro­
grammers or other technical people design particular 
systems without thinking more generally, things are not 
likely to be either simple or combinable. What may re­
sult is intricate user-level controls for one particular 
function, controls that are differently used for another 
particular function, making the two functions not com­
binable. 
What makes for the best control structures, then? 
There is no simple answer. I would say provisionally 
that it is a matter of unified and conspicuous constructs 
in the mental view of the domain to be controlled, 
corresponding to a well-distinguished and clearly-inter­
related set of controlling mechanisms. But that is hardly 
the la. •ord < i subje, 
THE ORGANIZATION OF WHOLENESS 
It should be plain that in responding screen-
systems, "what happens on the screen" and "how the 
controls respond" are not really distinguishable. 
The screen events are part of the way the controls 
respond. The screen functions and control functions 
merge psychologically. 
Now, there is a trap here. Just as the gas 
pedal, clutch, gearshift and brake merge psychologi­
cally, any control structure can merge psychological­
ly. Clutch and gear shift do not have, for most of us, 
clear psychological relevance to the problem of con­
trolled forward motion. Yet we psychologically inte­
grate the use of these mechanisms as a unified means 
for controlling forward motion (or, like the author, 
get an Automatic). In much the same way, any system 
of controls can gradually come through use to have a 
psychological organization, even spuriously. The trap 
is that we so easily lose sight of arbitrariness and 
even stupidity of design, and live with lt when it 
could be ao much better, because of this psychological 
melding. But useful wholeness can be helped along. Juat as 
what I have called the accordance-structure of writing

design that builds from a we11-organized internal dy-

are to make systems for regular people.

This concept extends Itself naturally to fantic space 
the space and relationships sensed by a viewer of any me­
dium, or a user in any presenting or responding environ­
ment. The design of computer display systems, then, is 
really the artful craftiny of fantic space. Technicalitie 
are aubscrvlent to effects. (Indeed, I think computer 
graphics is really a branch of movie-making.) 
FANTIC STRUCTURE 
The fantic structure of anything, then, consists of 
its noticeable parts, interconnections, contents and ef­
fects.

The general thinking in this system seems to be 
that the student may get an overall organizing view of 
what he is supposed to be learning (MAP); information on 
what he is currently supposed to be about (OBJ); canned 
suggestions based on what he's recently done (ADVICE). 
Mortver, he can get the system to present a rule about 
the subject or give him practice; and for either of 
these he may request easier rules or practice, or harder 
rules (i.e., more abstruse generalities) or harder prac­
tice.

way to divide up a subject— I'll be interested to se< 
how it works out— these controls do not seem to be wi

I have no doubt that the people working on this i

consider that the student's options might be clearer i

HELP 
What I aa trying to show here la that merely the 
arrangement of buttons creates different fsntic con­
structs. If you see this, you will recognize that 
considering all the other options we have, designing 
new media Is no small matter. The control structures 
merge mentally with the presentational structures. 
The temptation to settle on short-sighted designs hav­
ing shallow unity is all too great. 
FANTIC DESICN 
Fantic design Is basically the planning and selec­
tion of effects. (We could also call these "performance 
values"— cf. "production values" in movies.) 
Some of these intended effects are simply the com­
munication of information or cognitive structure— "in­
formation transfer," to use one of the more obtuse 
phrases current. Other desirable effects include orien­
ting the user and often moving him emotionally, including 
sometimes overwhelming or entrancing him. 
In the design of fantic systems involving automatic 
response, we have a vast choice among types of presenta­
tional techniques, tricks that are just now becoming 
understood. Not just screen techniques and functions, 
but also response techniques and functions. 
(If "feelie" aystems are ever perfected, as in 
Huxley's Brave New World, it's still the same in prin­
ciple. See Wachspress, p. T>*\^.) 
In both general areas, though— within media, and 
designing media— It seems to me that the creation of 
organizing constructs Is the most profound problem. 
In particular, the organizing constructs must not dis­
tract, or tear up contents. An analogy: in writing, the 
inventions of the paragraph, chapter and footnote were 
inventions In writing technique that helped clarify what 
was being expressed. What we need in computer-based 
fantic design is inventions which do not artificially 
chop up, constrain, or interfere with the subject (see 
box, Procrustes, nearby). 
I do not feel these principles are everywhere suf­
ficiently appreciated. For instance, the built-in 
structures of PLATO (see "Fantic Space of PLATO," p. 
|)*\ 7.7) disturbs me somewhat In Its arbitrariness— and 
the way its control keys are scattered around. 
But there is always something artificial— that is, 
some form of artifice— in presentation. So the problem 
is to devise techniques which have elucidating value but 
do not cut connections or ties or other relationships 
you want to save. (For this reason I suggest the reader 
consider "Stretchtext," p. -WV*] , collateral linkage 
(P- J)H 5^ ) > and the various hypergrams (p.J)P-j l^). 
These structures, while somewhat arbitrary and artifi­
cial, nevertheless can be used to handle a subject 
gently.) 
An Important kind of organizing construct is the 
map or overall orienting diagram. This, too, is often 
partly "exact" and partly "artifice:" certain aspects of 
the diagram may have unclear import but clear and help­
ful connotation. (For instance, consider the "picture 
systems" diagram on p. DM 2.0 — just what does the 
vertical dimension mean? Yes, but what does it really 
mean?) 
Responding systems now make it possible for such 
orienting structures to be multidimensional and respon­
ding (cf. the orienting function of the "dimensional 
flip" control illustrated on p. DM J| ). 
Fantic design, then, is the creation either of 
things to be shown (writing, movie-making, etc.) at the 
lower end, or media to show things in, or environments. 
1. The design of things to be shown— whether 
writing, movie-making, or whatever— is nearly always a 
combination of some kind of explicit structure— an ex­
planation or planned lesson, or plot of a novel— and 
a feeling that the author can control in varying degrees. 
The two are .deeply intertwined, however. 
The author (designer, director, etc.) must think 
carefully about how to give organization to what is 
being presented. This, too, has both aspects, cognition 
and feelings. 
At the cognitive end, the author must concern him­
self with detailed exposition or argument, or, in fiction, 
Plot• But simply putting appropriate parts together is 
not enough: the author must use organizing constructs to 
continually orient the reader's (or viewer's) mind. Re­
peated reference to main concepts, repeated shots (in a 
movie) of particular locations, serve this function; but 
each medium presents its own possible devices for this 
purpose. 
The organization of the feelings of the work 
criss-crosses the cognitive; but we can't get Into 
it here. Selection of points and parts contributes to both 
aspects. If you are trying to keep the feeling of a 
thing from being ponderous, you can never Include 
everything you wanted, hut must select from among the 
explicit points and feeling-generators that you have 
thought of. 
2. The design of media themselves, or of media 
subsystems, is not usually a matter of option. Books, 
movies, radio and TV are given. But on occasion, as 
for world's fairs or very personal projects, we have 
a certain option. Which allows things like: 
SmellavlBlon or whatever they called it: 
movies with a smell-track, which went out 
Into the theater through odor generators. 
Branching movies (see p.^HH1^). 
"Multi-media" (multiple audio tracks and si­
multaneous slide projections on different 
screens). 
Stereo movies. 
And so on. The thing about the ones mentioned ia that 
they are not viable as continuing setups for repeated 
productions. They do not offer a permanent wide market; 
they are not stable; they do not catch on. Which is in 
a way, of course, too bad. 
But the great change is Just about now. Current 
technicalities allow branching media— especially those 
associated with computer screens. And it Is up to us now 
to design them. 
3. MENTAL ENVIRONMENTS are working places for struc­
tured activity. The same principles of showmanship apply 
to a working environment as to both the contents of media 
and the design of media. If media are environments into 
which packaged materials are brought, structured environ­
ments are basically environments where you use non-packag­
ed material, or create things yourself. They might also 
be called "contentless media." The principles of whole­
ness in structured environments are the same as for the 
others, and many of our examples refer to them. 
The branching computer screen, together with the 
selfsame computer's ability to turn anything else on 
and off as selected by the user, and to fetch up in­
formation, yields a realm of option in the design of 
media and environment that has never existed before. 
Media we design for Bcreen-based computer syBterns are 
going to catch on widely, so we must be far more at­
tentive to the options that exist in order to commit— 
nationally, perhaps— to the best. 
In tomorrow's systems, properly unified controls 
can give us new flexibilities. If deeply well-designed, 
these promise magnificent new capabilities. For in­
stance, we could allow a musician to "conduct" the per­
formance of his work by a computer-based music synthesis 
system (see "Audio," p.>>*\il), perhaps controlling the 
many qualities of the performance on a screen as he goes, 
by means of such techniques as dimensional flip (see 
p.*tt7l). (The tradition of cumulative audio synthesis, 
as practiced in the fifties by Les Paul and Mary Ford, 
and more recently by Walter Carlos and Mike Oldfleld, 
will take on a new fillip as multidimensional control 
techniques become common.) One of the intents of this book has been to orient 
you to some of the possibilities and some of the options, 
considered generally. There la not rooa, unfortunately, 
to discuss more than one or two overall possibilities in 
detail. The most successful such system so fsr has been 
PLATO (discussed pp. DM18-19); others 
NEW MEDIA TO LAST 
What'a worse, we are confronted not merely with the 
Job of using computers to present specific things. The 
greater task ia to design overall computer media that 
will last us Into a more Intelligent future. Adrift in 
• sea of Ignorance and confusion, it is nevertheless our 
duty to try to create a whole transportation system that 
everybody can climb aboard. For the long run, fantic 
syatems must be treated not as custom systems for explicit 
purposes, but as OVERALL GENERAL DESIGNS WHICH WILL HAVE 
TO TIE TOGETHER AND CATCH OH. otherwise collapse and 
perish. 
FINAL CONSEQUENCES. 
It seems to me certain that we are moving toward 
a generalized and universal Fantic system; people can 
and should demand it. Perhaps there will be several; 
but if so, being able to tie them together for smooth 
transmission is essential. (Think of what it would be 
like if there were two kinds of telephones?) This then 
Is a great search and crusade: to put together truly 
general media for^future, systems at which we can read, 
write, learn and visualize, year after year after year• 
The initiatives are not likely to come from the more 
conventional computer people; aome of them are part of 
the problem. (Be prepared for every possible form of 
aggressive defensiveness from programmers, especially: 
"Why would you want that?" The correct answer is 
BECAUSE, dammit^) 
But this all means that Interior computer technical­
ities have to be SUBSERVIENT, and the programmers cannot 
be allowed to dictate how it is to behave on the basis 
of the underlevel structures that are convenient to them. 
Quite the contrary: from the fullest consideration of the 
richest upper-level structures we want, we the users-to-
be must dictate what lower-level structures are to be 
prepared within. 
But this means you, dear reader, must develop the 
fantic imagination. You must learn to visualize possible 
uses of computer screens, so you can get on down to the 
deeper level of how we are going to tie these things 
together. 
The designer of responding computer systems is 
creating unified setups for viewing and manipulating 
things— and the feelings, impressions and sense of things 
that go with them. Our goal should be nothing less than 
REPRESENTING THE TRUE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF HUMAN 
THOUGHT. (Yes, Dream Machines Indeed.) But it should 
be something more: enabling the mind to weigh, pursue, 
synthesize and evaluate ideas for a better tomorrow. 
Or for any at all.

Another application of tiv: Pre«nt Invention ia alao in «w »roa 
,f pictorial display, but offer. . great witty of poteDtUl user choice, in 
, simple circumstance. I call thi. the "miking net" .ystcm because control is 
effected through a changlne network of choices vblch step, or "v*lk," 
around the tcrcen. 
The problew of Intricate computer graphic, may be phrased aa 
rollovc: elvm that a dleltel <*n hold w wlds v*rlety of Graphical 
materials ready to present, how any the uaer most .imply »nd conveniently 
choose them? Indeed, how may the uaer keep track of what 1. happening, vter« 
he is and where he has been? 
The extern*! mechanism I have selected for this facility paradox­
ically combines great versatility for sophisticated presentations vith 41e.1t 
simplicity before the naive user. The Idea is this: the user may co=nnnd * 
continuing succession of changing presentations, making only one simple choice 
at • time, yet receiving Intricate and rich animations vith extremely clear 
continuity on the screen. 
The exterior mechanism is this: along with an arbitrary graphic 
presentation on the screen, the user is contlnuoualy presented vitb the image 
of a forking set of arrows, t .ys 
I—.H 
>K>U 
The pip is a conventional iii^it-pen cursor. Tne "current shank" is a line 
vhose Implicit gradations control developnentc In the picture; and the choice 
of arrows at too end of the current shank determine a discrete choice between 
alternatives that are to transpire. 
The user, seizing the pip vith the lightpsn, moves it {through 
the usual light pin techniques) sldcvviye alone the current shank. Moving it In 
the "forward" direction cuuees progressive developments in the plctuiz, moving 
It "backvard" causes a reversal of anititir.Tic and other previous developments. 
When the pip roichsc the chol-je j-oirit in the for.-j.-i direction, 
the user may drag lt (through the usual lightpen technique) along either oi 
the beckoning alternatives. This then causec further developments in the 
presentation consonant with the line selected. 
"Developments" of the picture here Include expansion, contraction 
sliding movements and fnurc-by-fnice animation. 
(Thece materials will have been, of course, explicitly input by 
authors and artists.) 
In a sample employment, consider a presentation on the subject 
of Volcanoes. Let the first shank of the control net control the "rise of a 
volcano from the sen"— an undulating ocean surface pierced first by d wisp of 
•moke, then a growing peak, with rivulets of lava Men to run down lt. sides 
and darken as they contribute to its growth. 
- UL. 
At the end of the first shank, the u;sr c^iy bran:h to two drrovt 
labelled respectively WORD ORISIH and UITERIOR. Either option continues 1!* 
presentation without a break, retaining much of the picture on the screen. 
Selection of WOTQ ORffilH cnunes the word VOLCAKO to change to VULCAII, and a 
picture of the god Vulcan is seen to seize a' lightning bolt rising frcra the 
crater; text appears to explain this. Alternatively, if the user chooses 
IKTE3I0R, the tubes and ducts within the volcano appear, and explanatory text Either of thece alternatives may continue with its ovr. 
development a and animation, under control of its own shank. 
Several features of thla control application are of special 
Interest. One Is that the presentation may be continuous In all directions, 
aiding In continuous uter orientation. Another is that presentations are 
reversible in various vuyo, an aid both In ucer orientation and self-study. 
(Not only is a demonstration reversible within a given shank, but the user may 
back the pip through an intersection into the antecedent shank--
which reappears at the Juncture as the llchtpen backs up— and the user cuy 
.inuc to reverse the presentation through that preceding shank, or to re-onte 
the intersection and mike another choice, "the path not taken.") These 
features allow the utter clearly to repent demonstrations as often aa he like, 
and to explore numerous alternatives. 
The displayed control net is thus to be understood as a large 
netvork of choices, mostly unseen, whose currently visible portion "walks" *iro< 
the screen aa use progresses. Within this system, then, numerous variants are 
possible. For instance, the currently visible portion of the net may Itself 
be whimsically incorporated in a picture, viz.:

You will of course recognize its cousins 
fantastic, fantasy, phantom. ("Phantom" means 
what is shown; in medical illustration it refers 
to an opaque object drawn as transparent; a 
"phantom limb" is an amputee's temporary feeling 
that the severed limb has been restored.) And a 
fantast is a dreamer. 
The word "fantics" would thus include 
the showing of anything (and thus writing 
and theater), which is more or less what I 
intended. The term is also intended to 
cover the tactics of conveying ideas and 
impressions, especially with showmanship 
and presentational techniques, organizing 
constructs, and fundamental structures 
underlying presentational systems.

Designing screen systems that focus 
the user's thought on his work, with help­

the great task of fantic design. 
In a system I designed for CRT motion-
picture editing, the user could maipulate 
written descriptions on the screen (corres­
ponding to the usual yellow-pad notes). To 
see the consequences of a particular splice, 
for instance, the editor would only have to 
draw a line between two annotated lines re­
presenting shots. Trim variations could be 
seen by moving this cut-line (illustrated). 
Not long after, CBS and Memorex did in­
troduce a system for movie-editing by CRT--
but I've heard that in their system the user 
has to actually deal with numbers. If so, 
this is missing the whole point.

Our greatest prooiems 11 
visualization of complexity. olve thinking and the 
By "Thinkertoy" I mean, first of all, a system 
to help people think. ('Toy' means it should be easy 
and fun to UBe.) This is the same general ides for 
which Engelbart, for instance, uses the term "aug­
mentation of intellect." 
But a Thinkertoy is something quite specific: 
I define it as a computer display system that helps 
you envision complex alternatives. 
The process of envisioning complex alternatives 
is by no means the only important form of human 
thought; but it is essential to making decisions, de­
signing, planning, writing, weighing alternate theor­
ies, considering alternate forms of legislation, doing 
scholarly research, and so on. it is also complicated 
enough that, in solving it, we may solve simpler prob­
lems as well. 
He will stress here some of the uses of these sy­
stems for handling text, partly because I think these 
are rather interesting, and partly because the com­
plexity and subtlety of this problem has got to be 
better understood: the written word is nothing less 
than the tracks left by the mind, and so we are really 
talking about screen systems for handling ideas, in 
all their complexity. 
Numerous types of complex things have to be inter-
compared, and their relations inter-comprehended. Here 
are a few of the many types: 
Alternative designs 
Discrepancies among the testimony of witnesses. 
Successive drafts of the same document. 
A 
Pairs of things which have some parts the 
same, some parts different (contracts, holy books, 
statutes of different states, draft versions of 
legislation...) i 
Different theories and their ties to parti­
cular examples and evidences. 
i 
Under examination these different types of inter-
comparison seem to be rather different. Now, one ap­
proach would be to create a different data structure 
and viewing technique for each different type of complex. 
There may be reasons for doing that in the future. 
For the present, however, it makes sense to try to 
find the most general possible viewing technique: one 
that will allow complex intercomparisons of all the 
types mentioned, and any others we might run across. 
One such technique is what I now call collatera-
tion, or the linking of materials into collateral struc­
tures,* as will be explained. This is fairly straight­
forward if you think enough about the problem; Engel­
bart discovered it independently. 
Let us call two structures collateral if there are 
links between them, connecting a selected part of one 
with a selected part of the other. The sequences of 
the connected parts may be different. For simplicity's 
sake, suppose each one is a short piece of writing. 
(He will also assume that there is some convenient form 
of rapid viewing and following between one end of a link 
and another.) 
rt Now, it will be noted first off that this is an ex­
tremely general method. By collateral structuring we 
can easily handle the equivalents of: tables of contents; 
indexes) comments and marginalia; explanations, exegesis, 
explication; labeling; headings; footnotes; notes by the 
writer to himself; comments and questions by the reader 
for later reference; and additional details out of se­
quence . 
Collateration, then, is the creation of such 
multiple and viewable linkB BETWEEN ANY TWO DATA 
STRUCTURES, in principle. It is general and powerful 
enough to handle a great variety of possible uses in 
human intellectual endeavor, and deserves consider--
able attention from researchers of every stripe.** 
The problem then, is how to handle this for 
rapid and convenient viewing and whatever other work 
the user wants to do— writing and splicing, inter-
comparing, annotating and so on. Two solutions ap­
pear on this spread: The Parallel Textface^, design­
ed as a seminal part of the Xanadu system (see p.>\•>£.), 
which I hope will be marketed with that system in the 
near future, and a more recent design which I've work­
ed on at the University of Illinois, the 3D Thinkertoy 
or Th3. 
CLARITY AND POWER 
He stressed on the other side of the book that 
computer systems must be clear, simple and easy to use. 
Where things like business uses of computers are con­
cerned, which are intrinsically so simple in principle, 
some of the complications that people have been forced 
to deal with in ill-designed computer systems verge on 
the criminal. (But some computer people want others 
to think that's the way it has to be. "Your first 
duty is to keep your job, right?" one computer person 
said to me recently. "It wouldn't do to set up systems 
so easy to use that the company wouldn't need you any­
more." See "Cybercrud," p.8.) 
But if it is desirable that computer systems for 
simple-minded purposes be easy to use, it is absolutely 
necessary that computer systems for complicated purposes 
be simple to use. If you art wrangling over complex al­
ternatives— say, in chess, or in a political simula­
tion game (see "Simulation," p. S$ ) , or in the throes 
of trying to write a novel, the last thing you will tole­
rate is for your computer screen to introduce complica­
tions of its own. If a system for thinking doesn't 
make thinking simpler— allowing you to see farther and 
more deeply— it is uselss, to use only the polite terra. 
But systems can be both powerful and simple at 
the same time. The myth that things have to be com­
plicated to do anything for you is pernicious rubbish. 
Well-designed systems can make our mental tasks lighter 
and our achievements come faster. tt is for thia reason that I consnend^the reader 
these two designs of mine: as examples of user-level 
control and viewing designs— fantic environments, If 
you will (see p!^i*,)~ that are pruned and tuned to 
give the user great control over the viewing and crosjs-
consideration of intricate alternatives, without oom-
plicatlon. I like to believe that both of these, in­
deed, are ten-minute ayatews— that is, when w« get 
them running, the range of uses shown here can be taught 
to naive users in ten minutes or less. 
It is because of my heartfelt belief in this kind 
of simplicity that I stress the creation of prefabrica­
ted environments, carefully tuned for easy use, rather 
than the creation of computer languages which must be 
learnt by the user, as do such people as Engelbart (see 
and DeFanti (see p.^MO . Now, their approach 
bbviously has considerable merit for sophisticated users 
who want to tinker repeatedly with variant approaches. 
For people who want to work incessantly in an environ­
ment, and oil other things— say writers— and are ab­
sent-minded and clumsy and nervous and forgetful (like 
the present author), then the safe, prefabricated en­
vironment, with thoroughly fail-safe functions and ut­
terly memorable structural and control interrelation­
ships, is the only approach. 
* In my 1965 paper (see bibliography) I called collateral 
structures zlppered lists. 
A group at Brown University has reportedly worked 
along these lines since I worked with them, but due 
to certain personal animosities I have not kept up 
with their developments. It will be interesting to 
see what kind of response they can get out of the 
IBM systems they are using.

U e might also It has been recognized from the dawn of computer display that the 
grandest ar.d most important use of the computer display should be to 
aid decisions and creative thought. The work of Ivan Sutherland (SKETCHPAD) 
and Douglas Engelbart have really shown how we may use the display to 
visualize and effect our creative decisions swiftly and vividly. 
For some reason, however, the most important aspect of such systems 
has been neglected, '.-.'e do not icake important decisions, we should not 
make delicate decisions, serially and irreversibly. Rather, the power of 
the computer display (and its computing and filing support) must be so 
crafted that we may develop alternatives, spin out their complications 
and interrelationships, and visualize these upon a screen. 
No system could do this for us automatically. What design and 
programming can create, however, is a facility that will allow us 
to list, sketch, link and annotate the complexities we seek to under-t 
stand, then present "views" of the complexities in reany different forms. 
Studying those views, annotating and refining, we can reach the final 
designs and decisions witb much rore in mind than we could otherwise 
hold together in the imagination. 
Some of the facilities that such systems must have include the 
followi ng: 
Annotations to anything, to any remove. 
Alternitives of decision, design, writing, theory. 
Unlinked or irrerru]ar pieces, hanging as the user wishes. 
Multicou-cling, or complex linkage, between alternatives, annota­
tions or whatever. 
Historical filing of the user's actions, including each addition 
and modification, and possibly the vieving actions that preceded them. 
Frozen ironr-nts and versions, which the user may hold as memorable 
for his thinking. 
Kvc.lutior.ary coupling, where the correspondences between evolving 
versions tire automatically maintained, and their differences or relations 
easily annotated. 
In addition, designs for screen "views", the motion, appearance 
and disappearance of elements, require considerable thought and Imagi­
nation. 
The object ic not to burden the user, or make him aware of complex­
ities in which he has no interest. But almost everyone in intellectual 
and decision pursuits has at some time an implicit need for some of 
these facilities. If people knew they were possible, they would demand 
them. It is time for their creation. 
A full-fledged decision/creativity system, embracing both text and 
graphics, is one of the ultimate design goals of Project XANADU.

anywhere else that we need to understand and mani-PARAU.EL TEXTFACE C19 71) 
It will also work with certain animated graphics. 
The Parallel Textface, as described here, 
furnished the initial impetus for the development 
of the Xanadutnl system (see p. J)*" 5"fc) • Xanadu was 
developed, indeed, originally for the purpose of 
implementing some of these functions, but the two 
split apart. It turned out that the Parallel 
Textface required an extremely unusual data struc-
structure and program techniques; these then became 
the Xanadu system. As developed in the final 
Xanadu design, they turn out to handle some very 
unusual kinds of screen animation and file retrieval. 
But this grew out of structuring a system to handle 
the functions described here. 
Thus the Parallel Textface basically requires 
a Xanadu system. 
It is hoped that this system can be sold com­
plete (including minicomputer or microprocessor--
no connection to a large computer is required) for 
a few thousand' dollars by 1976 or 1977. See p. 
(Since "business people" are extremely skeptical 
as to whether anybody would want such a thing, I 
would be interested in hearing expressions of in­
terest, if any.) Real person sits at

Collateral links between materials in the 
two panels are displayed as movable lines bet­
ween the panels. (Text omitted in this diagram; 
panel boundary has been made to appear.) 
Some links may not have both their endpoints 
displayed at once. In this case we show the in­
complete link as a broken arrow, pointing in the 
direction of the link's completion. 
The broken arrow serves not merely as a vi­
sual pointer, but as a jump-marker leading to the 
linked material. By zapping the broken arrow with 
the lightpen, the user summons the linked material--
as shown by the completion of the link to the other 
panel. (Since there has been a jump in the second 
panel, we see that in this case the other link has 
been broken.) 
When such links lead to different places, both 
of these destinations may nevertheless be seen at 
once. This is done by pointing at both broken links 
in succession; the system then allows both links to 
be completed, breaking the second panel between the 
two destinations (as shown by dotted line across 
panel).

FAIL-SAFE AND HISTORICAL FEATURES. 
In systems for naive users, it is essential 
to safeguard the user from his own mistakes. Thus 
in text systems, commands given in error must be 
reversible. For instance, Carmody's system (see 
p. DM47) requires confirmation of deletions. 
Another highly desirable feature would allow 
the user to view previous versions, to see them col­
laterally with the corresponding parts of current 
versions, and even go back to the way particular 
things were and resume work from the previous 
version. 
In the Parallel Textface this is all com­
prised in the same extremely simple facility. (Ex­
tremely simple from the user's point of view, that 
is. Inside it is, of course, hairy.) 
In an egregious touch of narcissistic humor, 
we use the very trademark on the screen as a control 
device (expanded from the "X" shown in the first 
panel 1 
Actually the X in "Xanadu1™," as it appears 
on the screen, is an hourglass, with a softly fall­
ing trickle of animated dots in the lower half, and 
Sands of Time seen as heaps above and below. These 
have a control, as well as a representative, func­
tion. 
TO UNDO SOMETHING, YOU MERELY STEP "BACKWARD 
IN TIME" by dagging the upper part of the hourglass 
with the lightpen. One poke, one editing operation 
undone. Two pokes, two operations. 
You may then continue to view and make changes 
as if the last two operations had never taken place. 
This effectively creates an alternative time-line.* 
iiowever, if you decide that a previously undone edit 
operation-Jhould be kept after all, you may step 
forward-- stepping onto the previous time-line--
oy using the lower half of the hourglass. 
©1171 V- iieL»U 
We see this clarified in a master time diagram 
or Kevisic-n Tree which may be summoned to the screen 
never mind how. ln this example we see that three 
versions are still "current,"Various other starts 
and variations having been abandoned. (The shaggy 
fronds correspond to short-lived variations, relult-
ing from operations which were then reversed. In 
other words "excised" time-lines, to use Gerrold's 
term-- see footnote.) «ciiUiu »

(The labels say: "Conflicting versions," "New account

In other words, in this approach we annotate and 
label discrepancies, and verbally comment on differen­
ce! in separate files or documents. 
In ways this may seem somewhat obtuse. Yet above 
all i_t is orderly, and the complex of collateral files 
has a clarity that could be all-too-easily lost in sy­
stems which were programmed more specifically to each 
problem. ,„,. 
The File Startm is a quick index into the con­

Rather than giving the user anything complicat­
ed to learn, the system is completely, visual. A11 
edit controls are comprised in this diagram, the Edit 
Rose"1. Viz..: The fundamental strength of collateration, 
seen here, is of course that any new structure 
collateral to another may be used as a table of 
contents or an outline, taking the user instantly 
to parts which are of interest in some new context. 
* Oddly, this has the same logical structure as 
time-travel in science-fiction. 
There are basically three alternate premises of 
of time-travel: I) that the past cannot be changed, 
all events having preceded the backstep; 2) that the 
past can be changed; and 3) that while time-travelers 
may be-a*eluded into thinking (2), that (1) is really 
the case-- leading to various appointment-in-Samarra 
plots. 
Only possibility (2) is of interest here, but 
there are various alternative logics of mutability and 
time-line stepping. One of the best I have seen is in 
The Man Who Folded Himself by David Gerrold (Popular 
LTFrary ."ITTS) : logic expounded pp. 64-8. I am be­
mused by the parallel between Gerrold's time-controls 
and those, worked out independently.

Inly *nrl 
This design, TfO (Thinkertoy In 
3 dimensions), ii one I have been work­
ing at while on the faculty of the Univ­
ersity of Illinois. It is designed spe­
cifically for Implementation using De­
Fanti's CRASS language (see p.,5*1 31). 
and the Vector Ceneral 3D display (see 
p.'^O). Whether It will ever be actually 
programed depends, of course, on numer­
ous factors. 
It is meant to be a very high-
power thinkertoy, suitable for experimen­
tation with creative processes, especially 
writing and three-dimensional design. 
(There Is no room to discuss the latter 
here.) It is suited(specially to the visual­
ization of tentative structures in amorphous 
clusters. In some of its features lt goes 
considerably beyond the more "commercial" 
thinkertoy system, the Psrsllel Textface 
(elsewhere in this spread). 
Nevertheless, the same design criteria 
apply: a well-designed computer environment 
for any purpose should be learnable In ten 
minutes; otherwise the designer has not been 
doing his job. (I mean it would be learnable 
in ten minutes if you and I had it in front 
of us, working. This description will have 
to be weird and abstruse, I'm sorry to say.) 
This system Is designed around a three-
dimensional display screen (the Vector Cener­
al display, as manlpulable by thq^RASS lan­
guage). 
Now, most people do not think of text 
as three-dimensional. Laymen think of it as 
two-dimensional, since it's usually printed 
on rectangular pages. Computer people or­
dinarily think of it as one-dimensional, as 
a long string of characters and spaces— 
essentially what you'd get If you printed 
things in one line on a long, long ribbon. 
Well, frankly, I don't think of text as 
three-dimensional either; but like anything 
else, it has numerous qualities or dimen­
sions, any three of which it's nice to be 
able to view at once (see "Dimensional Flip,") 
p.«•&(). And that's essentially the idea: 
the three dimensions we'll look at at any 
one time will be a particular view of a larger 
whole. 
Now, the basic torn of storage will be 
one of those Nelson-structures that drives 
computer people batty. Specifically, the 
basic data structure will be clusters of 
points. 
Puns sometimes reflect a higher reality. 
Now it turns out that this structure in fact 
reflects a great Folk Truth: written discourse 
does in fact consist of "points" which you 
intend to get across• That we here intend to 
have them rotate as dots upon a screen reflects 
this structure. 
Writing is, in fact, a projection from 
the Intended "points" to a finished exposition 
which embraces them. Now, this is very like 
the view of language held in modern linguistics, 
namely, that a finished sentence is a "surface 
structure" constructed out of basic sentence 
kernels chewed up by certain transformations• 
Hell, I am just pointing out here that writing 
Is a surface structure of "points" which have 
been embedded and spliced in a structure of 
transitions, accordance-notes and so forth (see 
The general idea of the Th3 system, then, 
is that the user may view the "points" he 
wishes to make, variously upon the 3D viewing 
surface. Successive drafts, then, will all be 
projections, geometrically, from this interior 
structure of points. 
Finally, the unifying ide; 
system simplicity is this: all 
faces of a cube. the 
(FURTHER TECHNICALITIES OF THESE 'POINTS': 
Each point may have a value (numerical pa­
rameter) in any of a number of dimensions 
(which number may itself change). Such 
values may be null, as distinct from zero, 
showing that the point has no position on 
that particular scale. 
Associated with each point may be one 
or more pieces and scraps or written mater­
ial. Such scraps may be just phrases or 
single words. (Indeed, such scraps may be 
associated not just with a point, but with 
several specific values of a point.) Each 
(crap may also contain keywords 
— .elatlons between pol 
also be defined. There may be a va 
of types of relation, which either 
between two points of don't.) riety The crucial point here la that It's unified 
to the user: every version appears on a aide of 
a box; and a typeset version Is simply a magni­
fied two-dimensional view in which the two dimen­
sions are "position In oversll text" (vertical) 
and "position on line" (horizontal). 
Each side of a box may have a different 
view projected to it. This means that as many 
aa three views of s specific cluster may be 
seen at once. However, for consistency these 
must have appropriately comaon dimensions. 
By rotation and zooming the user may focus 
on the original pieces, and work with them, writ­
ing and revising. 
Moreover, by using a combination of zoom 
and hardware clipping (as available on thia 
equipment), the user may restrict hla work to 
a specific range of material on particular di-
GALAXY AND BOX 
There are basically two views of what 
you are working with: the Galaxy and the Box. 
They appear in various manifestations, allow­
ing you to study discrete relations and struc­
tures in the material; various "dimensions" of 
Che material; alternate versions and drafts to 
be made from the material; and the complex col-
lateration (see under "Thinkertoys") of differ­
ent structures. 
In what follows we will discuss the screen 
functions but not the control structures, which 
have not firmed up particularly. 
1. GALAXY VIEWS. 
The points are seen as a cloud of dots on 
the screen. If no view coordinates are supplied, 
the dots will be randomly positioned. 
A. "Star Trek" effect. 
Under a user's zoom control, the dots 
fly apart as If he is hurtling through 
space. 
B. MAGNIFICATION. The user may "magnify" 
the dots, making each show Its keywords, 
further text, and on up to the full 
Piece. 
C. ROTATION. The 3D structure of the dots 
in space may be seen by the user at 
any time through short rotations• 
0. Any relations that exist among the 
Points, insofar as they have been logg­
ed into the system, may be displayed 
E. The user may sort the points by moving 
them with a lightpen. 
F. The user may write within the individ­
ual pieces and splice them together, 
combining lightpen and keyboard oper­
ations. 
2. BOX VIEWS 
In the Galaxy Views, the individual Points 
simply swarm about with no definable position. 
'Box Views" allow you to order the points on any 
dimensions that have meaning to you, in an ar­
bitrary coordinate-space. 
The box is more than a mere measurement-
frame. On request the user may see the points 
projected on a specific face of the box (ortho-
graphically); and on request he may also see pro­
jection lines between a box-face and its cor­
responding point in the point cluster. 
"Magnifying^1 as before, will create a view 
of the text: but In the box mode of viewing, the 
text appears on the side of the box. That is, 
the inner view will project to the outside, 
yielding a draft. Naturally, this is the current 
assembly of your pieces; If certain coordinates 
are selected it is even a "typeset" version. 
(Note: Vector General hardware does not al­
low character rotation; only keyword and headline 
rotation Is possible, through software character 
generation. Thus text pieces on the side of a 
box show certain freaky movements If the side is 
not viewed square-on.) 
^At the 1971 Spring Joint Computer Conference, I think lt was, 
I was heckled by a linguist who accused me of being "unimaginative,' 
insisting further that writing is merely an extension of speech 
and thus "merely" the application of further transformations; and 
he claimed further that what the uaer therefore needs is an input 
language to specify these transformations. This view, while Inter­
esting, is wrong. 
A but/indeed control language might be intei \ t*»ffvej 
COLLATERAL GALAXIES AND BOXES. 
Viewing of collateral structures works 
through the same mechanism. Galaxies and 
boxes may be collaterated: 
COMPLICATED NOTE: The extension of these 
mechanisms to pictorial graphics in two 
and three dimensions Is straightforward, 
and to conceptual substructures (such as 
may exist) behind these graphics. The 
same goes for collateration and annotation 
of multidimensional cluster materials, e.g. 
in sociology: the system would allow, for 
instance, the viewing, annotation and col­
lateration of sociometrIc clusterings.) 
BOX FISSION. (The Beauty Part.) 
For paired views of projections from 
the same cluster which do not share a com­
mon coordinate, a marvelous trick Is pos­
sible: BOX FISSION. Starting with one box 
containing a galaxy, we pull lt apart, 
making two boxes and two galaxies whose 
Points are linked. 
Now both boxes can be rotated indepen­
dently, and any view considered; equivalence-
linkages may now be viewed between any two 
views. (The eye must, however, turn two 
however-operatlon, a postfix "but. iting, however. 
[Appended by the 
See "Writing," p. DM*(3 . ] (It Is interesting to note Lnat the links in 
Box Fission are handled automatically, to an 
extent, by the hardware.) 
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE. HUH? 
This has summarized the development of 
some ideas for the viewing and manipulation 
of complex stuff. I offer this design, inso­
far as I have been able to present lt hejje, 
as an example of fantic design (see p. 50 )• 
There ls.no logical necessity to it; it cor­
responds to the traditional structure of no 
technical system; it arises from no intrinsic 
or traditional data structures used for com­
puter representation of these things. 
But none of these considerations is to 
the point. This design has a certain stark 
logical simplicity; it extends itself plaus­
ibly from its basic outlook (or starting 
ideas, if you can isolate them) into a tool 
for truly Intricate cross-consideration, 
without adding unnecessary and h«rd-to- ^ 
remember "technicalities." At least that s 
how I think of it. 
Obviously the aesthetics of lt are Im­
portant to the designer. But a more final 
criterion of its goodness— Its usefulness— 
may depend on the same parsimony and organi­
zational clarity.

Is Xanadu did Kubla Khan 
A stately pleasure-dome decree : 
Where Alpli, the sacred river, ran 
Through caverns measureless to man 
Down to a sunless wit. 
So twice five miles of fertile ground 
With walls and towers were girdled round : 
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills 
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree: 
And here were forests undent ns the hills, 
Enfolding sunny spot* of greenery. 
But oh ! that deep romantic cluui'u which slanted 
Down the green hill athwart a crdarn cover I 
A savage place ! us holy and enchanted 
As e'er beneath a waning moon was liaunted 
By woman walling for her demon-lover ! 
And from this chasm, with ceoM-lcss turmoil seething. 
As If this earth In fast thick p uutn were brcatiling, 
A mighty fountain momently won forced : 
Amid whose swift ualf-intermltted burst 
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, 
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's nail : 
And 'mid uww rfiuiHng rocks at once and ever 
It flung^ up momently the sacred river. 
Five miles meandering with a mn/y motion 
Through wood and dale the sucred liver ran, 
Tben reached the caverns measureless to man, 
And sank In tumult to a lifeless ocean : 
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far 
Ancestral voices prophesying war ! 
The shadow of the dome of pleasure 
Floated mid way on the waves ; 
Where was beard the mingled measure 
From the fountain and the caves. 
Il was a miracle of rare device, 
A tunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice 1 
A damsel with a dulcimer 
In a vision ouce I saw : 
It was an Abyssinian muid, 
And on her dulcimer she played, 
Hersymphouv nml song. 
To such a deep delight 'twould win mc 
That with music loud and long, 
I would build that dome in air, 
That sunny dome ! those caves of Ice ! 
And all who beard should see liicm there. 
And all should cry. Beware ! Beware ! 
His flashing eves, his ftoaiiug buir [ 
Weave a circle round him thrice, J bim thrice, 
And close your eyes with holy dread, 
For he on Loucj-dew hath fed. 
And drunk the milk of Paradise. 
"Is that the river that runs down to the sea?" 
James Stewart 
in 
"The FBI Story." 
Patent work on Xanadu is in progress. Xanadu, friend, is my_ dream. 
The name comes from the poem (nearby); 
Coleridge's little story of the artistic trance 
(and the Person from Porlock) make it an appro­
priate name for the Pleasure Dome of the crea­
tive writer. The Citizen Kane connotations, 
and any other connotations you may find in the 
poem, are side benefits. 
I have been working on Xanadu, under this 
and other names, for fourteen years now. 
Originally it was going to be a super sys­
tem for handling text by computer (see p. iCi. 
and |^ ). But it grew: as I realized, level 
by level, how deep the problem was. 
And the concept of what it was to be kept 
changing, as I saw more and more clearly that 
it had to be on a minicomputer for the home. 
(You can have one in your office too, if you 
want, but that's not what it's about.) 
Now the idea is this: 
To give you a screen in your home from 
which you can see into the world's hypertext 
libraries. 
(The fact that the world doesn't have 
any hypertext libraries-- yet-- is a minor 
point.) 
To give you a screen system that will 
offer high-performance computer graphics and 
•text services at a price anyone can afford. 
To allow you to send and receive written mes­
sages at the Engelbart level (see p.J)I/|i/6)« To 
allow you to explore diagrams (see p. 0MI9and 
P. t>f*l51) . To eliminate the absurd distinction 
between "teacher" and "pupil." 
To make you a part of a new electronic 
literature and art, where you can get all your 
questions answered and nobody will put you 
down. 
Originally Xanadu was programmed around 
the Parallel Textface (see p. . But as 
the requirements of the Parallel Textface were 
better and better understood, Xanadu became 
a more general underlying system for all forms 
of interactive graphic environments. Its data 
structure has Virtual Blocklessness and is 
thus well related to the smooth motions needed 
by screen users. Thus in its final form, now 
being debugged, it will support not only the 
Parallel Textface (see p.^Z) )» the Walking Net 
(see p. W15| ) , Stretchtext (seep.DMl9), Zoom 
Maps (see p. 13) and so on, but indeed any 
data structure that needs to combine complex 
linkages with fast access and rapid changes. 
Because the data structure is recursively 
extensible, it will permit hypertext (see p.DrlTl) 
of any depth and complexity, and the collateral 
linkage (see p.j}|^2) of any objects of contemp­
lation. 
Xanadu is under private development and 
should be avail'able, if the economy holds, in 
1976. Regrettably, first prices will not be at 
the $3000 level necessary for the true Home 
System. Exact equipment for the production ver­
sion has not been selected. A number of micro­
processors (see p. ^ H ) are in serious conten­
tion, notably the Lockheed SUE, but there's 
something to be said for a regular mini. The 
PDP-11 is of interest (see p. H 2 ); (so espe­
cially is its Cal Data lookalike-- unless DEC 
would like to build us a PDP-11X with seven modes 
of indirect display addressing. Are you reading 
this, Ken Olsen?) And here's a laugh: a com­
pany called IBM may in fact make a suitable com­
puter, except that they call it the "3740 Work 
Station." So for those customers who want IBM 
equipment, maintenance and prices, with Xanadu 
software, it's a definite possibility. 
So, fans, that about wraps it up. I'll be 
interested in hearing from people who want this 
system; many hardheaded business people have 
told me nobody will. Prove 'era wrong, America! 
Of course, if hyper-media aren't the great­
est thing since the printing press, this whole 
project falls flat on its face. But it is hard 
for me to conceive that they will not be.

STANDARDIZATIOej. Taking a lesson from the integrated 
work of various people whose work haa been described 
in thla book, wa aee that If you want a thing done 
right, you have to do it youraelf- (eraat Ideaa of 
Western Man; one of a aeriea.) My good friend Calvin 
Nooara with hla TMC Language (aee pp. 18-21) haa die-
covered that trademark is one way to nail thla ae a 
right. 
Several levels of standardization are important with 
Xanadu. One, all Xanadu ayataau must be abla to work 
with all Xanadu files (except for possible variations 
in screen performance and aixe of local memory), How. 
there are those who would not be concerned for this 
sort of universality, and who wight even try to make 
sure systems were incompatible, so that you had to buy 
acceaaorlaa and conversion kits up and down the line. 
That ia one of the things that must be avoided! "par­
tial* compatibility, subject to expensive options and 
conditions, a well-known technique In the field. 
By stabilising the "Xanadu" trademark, I hope to pre­
vent such shenanigans. Thus every accredited Xanadu 
system will offer full compatibility with the data 
atructure. and either full performance or substitutes 
aa necessitated by the hardware. The "Xanadu" trademark 
can thus In principle be made available to manufacturers 
abiding by all design features of the system. 
Second, all Xanadu systems should be able to work with 
outside systems either through or off the net, lf_ they 
conform to the unusual data rules required by the un­
usual design of the system. This assures that Xanadu 
systems will be compatible with any other popular net­
works. It also assures others who want to offer Xan-
adu-claaa services to system owners (through, e.g., 
conventional time-sharing) that If thay adhere to tha 
rules (sea "Canon*." p.»*t?f) they can play the game 
on a certified basis.

able In 1975 for at least one machine (guess which).

saction! occur through formalized ceremonies at consoles. A world when- wo can 
learn, study, create, and share our creations without having privately to schlepp and 
physically safeguard them. There is a familiar, all-embracing motto, the jingle we 
all know from the day school lets out, which I take quite seriously: "No more pencils; 
•o more books, no more teacher*' dirty looks " The Fantic Ace. 
My work is concerned principally with the 
theory and execution of systems useful to the mind 
and the creative imagination. This has polemical 
and practical aspects: I claim that the precepts of 
designing systems thai touch people's minds, or 
contents to be shown in them, are simple and uni­
versal: making things look good, feel right and 
come across clearly. I claim thai to design systems 
that involve both machines and people's minds is 
art first, technology second, and in no way a deri­
vative specialty off in some branch of computer 
science. 
However, presentational systems will cer­
tainly involve computers from now on. 
Since hundreds of such systems are now 
being built, many of them all wrong, we must 
teach designers (end certain others) the basics 
of computers, and give them some good examples 
lo emulate (such as Sutherland's Sketchpad, 
Bilzer's PLATO, and, I hope, some of my own 
designs). 
Further, the popular superstitions about 
computers must be fought-- the myths that they 
are mechanistic, scientific, objective or indepen­
dent of human intent and contemplative involve-It ts essential to state these firmly and 
publicly, because you are going to see a lot 
of systems in the near future that purport to 
be the last-word cst's-pajama systems to bring 
you "all Ihe information you need, anytime, 
anywhere." Unless you have thought about It 
you may be snowed by systems which are in­
herently and deeply limiting. Here are some 
of the things which I think we will all want. 
(The salesman for the other syatem will say 
they are impossible, or "We don't know how 
to do that yet," the standard puldown. But 
these things arc possible, if wc design them 
In from the bottom up; and there are many 
different valid approaches which could bring 
these things into being3 
These arc rules, derived from common 
sense and uncommon concern, about what people 
can and should have in gcnernl screen systems, 
systems to read from. 
1. EASY AND ARBITRARY FRONT ErJDS. 
The "front end" of a system-- lhat Is, 
the program that creates the presentations for 
the user and interacts with him-- must be clear 
and simple for people to use and understand. 
THE TEN-MINUTE RULE. Any system 
which cannot be well taught to a layman in 
ten minutes. by a tutor in the presence of a 
responding setup, is too complicated. This may 
sound far too stringent; I think not. Rich and 
powerful systems may be given front ends which 
arc nonetheless ridiculously clear: this is a 
design problem of the foremost importance. 
TEXT MUST MOVE, that is, slide on the 
screen when the user steps forward or backward 
within the text he is reading. The alternative, 
to clear the screen and lay out a new presenta­
tion, is baffling to the eye and thoroughly dis­
orienting, even with practice. 
Many computer people do not yet under­
stand the necessity of this. The problem is that 
if the screen is cleared, and something new 
then appears on it, there is no visual way to 
tell where the new thing came from: sequence 
and structure become baffling. Having it slide 
on the screen allows you to understand where 
you've been and where you're going: a feeling 
you also get from turning pages of a book. 
(Some close substitutes may be possible on 
some types of screen.) 
On front ends supplied for normal users, 
there must be no explicit computer languages 
requiring input control strings, no visible eso­
teric symbols. Graphical control structures 
having clarity and safety, or very clear task-
oriented keyboards, are among the prime alter­
natives. 
All operations must be fail-safe. 
Arbitrary front ends must be attachable: 
since we are talking about reading from text, 
or text-and-picture complexes, stored on a 
large data system, the presentational front end 
must be separable from Ihe data services pro­
vided further down in the system, so the user 
may attach his own front-end system, having 
his own style of operation and his own private 
conveniences for roving, editing and other forms 
of work or play at the screen. 
2. SMOOTH AND RAPID DATA ACCESS. 
The system must be built to make possible 
fast and arbitrary access to a potentially huge 
data base, allowing extremely large files (at 
least into the billions of characters). However, 
the system should be contrived lo allow you to 
read forward, back or across links without sub­
stantial hesitation. Such access must be impli­
cit, not requiring knowledge of where things are 
physically stored or what the internal file names 
may.happen to be. File divisions must be in­
visible to the user in all his roving operations 
(FREEDOM OF ROVING): boundaries must be 
invisible in the final presentations, and the user 
must not need to know about them. 
3. RICH DATA FACILITIES. 
Arbitrary linkages must be possible be­
tween portions of text, or lext and pictures; 
annotation of anything must be provided for; 
collateration (see p. »g0) should be a standard 
facility, between any pair of well-defined ob­
jects; PLACEMARK facilities must be allowed" 
to drop anchor at. or in, anything. These 
features imply private annotations to publicly-
accessible materials as a standard automatic 
service mode. 
The AI people don't understand, 
the IR people don't understand, 
the CAI people don't understand, 
and for God's sake don't tell IBM. I believe that an introduction to any 
subject can be humorous, occasionally pro­
found, exciting, vivid, and appealing even 
to experts on their-separate levels. 
Perhaps someday I can prove it. 
The user must be allowed multiple rovers 
(movable placemarks at points of current activity); 
making possible, especially, multiple windows 
(to the location of each rover) with displays or 
collateral links. 
The system should also have provision 
for high-level mooting (yisv^ and the auto­
matic keeping of historical trails. 
Then, a complex of certain very necessary 
and very powerful facilities based on these things, 
viz.: 
A. ANTHOLOGICAL FREEDOM: the user must 
be able to combine easily anything he finds into 
an "anthology," a rovable collection of these 
materials having the structure he wants. The 
linkage information for such anthologies must be 
separately transportable and passable between 
users. 
B. STEP-OUT WINDOWING: from a place 
in such an anthology, the user must be able 
to step out of the anthology and into the previous 
context of the material. For instance, if he has 
just read a quotation, he should be able to have 
the present anthological context dissolve around 
the quotation (while it stays on the screen), and 
the original context reappear around it. The 
need of this in scholarship should be obvious. 
C. D1SANTHOLOGICAL FREEDOM: the 
user must be able to step out of an anthology 
in such a way and not return if he chooses. 
(This has important implications for what muat 
really be happening in the file structure.) 
Earlier versions of public documents must 
be retained, as users will have linked to them. 
However, where possible, linkages must 
also be able to survive revisions of one or both 
objects. 
The assumption must be made at the 
outset of a wicked and malevolent governmental 
authority. If such a situation does not develop, 
well and good; if it does, the system will have 
a few minimal safeguards built in. 
FREEDOM FROM BEING MONITORED. The 
use of pseudonyms and dummy accounts by indi­
viduals, as well as the omission of certain record­
keeping by the system program, are necessary 
here. File retention under dummy accounts is 
also required. 
Because of the danger of file sabotage, and 
the private at-home retention by individuals of 
files that also exist on public systems, it is 
necessary to have FIDUCIAL SYSTEMS FOR TELLING 
WHICH VERSION IS AUTHENTIC. The doctoring 
of on-line documents, the rewriting of history--
cf. both Winston Smith's continuous revision of 
the encyclopedia in Nineteen Eighty-Four and 
H.L. Hunt's forging of historical telegrams for 
"The White House"-- is a constant danger. Thus 
our systems must have a number of complex 
provisions for verification of falsification, espe­
cially the creation of multilevel fiducials (parity 
systems), and their storage in a variety of 
places. These fiducials must be local izable and 
separate to small parts of files. 
7. COPYRIGHT. 
Copyright must of course be retained, but 
a universal flexible rule has to be worked out, 
permitting material to be transmitted and copied 
under specific circumstances for the payment of 
a royalty fee, surcharged on top of your other 
expenses in using the system. 
For any Individual section of material, 
such royalty should have a maximum: i.e., "by 
now you've bought it." 
Varying royalty rates, however, should 
be the arbitrary choice of the copyright holder; 
except that royalties should not vary sharply 
locally within a tissue of material. On public 
screens, moving between areas of different roy­
alty cost must be sharply marked.

Now you aee why I brought you here. 
This Gem-maniacal book has, obviously, been 
created as a crossroad of several cross pur­
poses: to furnish a needed, grabby layman's 
introduction to two vast but rather inaccessible 
realms; to present a coherent, if contentious, 
point of view, and unroll a particular sort of 
apocalyptic vision after preparing the vocabulary 
for it; to make bright friends and informed sup­
porters for my outlook and projects; to gel home 
to some of my friends the fact thai what I am 
doing is at boitom not technical; and finally, if 
nothing else, to set forth some principles about 
the way things should be, which others will 
have-to answer if they propose to do less. 
Thus, overall, this book is a message in a Klein 
bottle, waiting to see who's thirsty. 
1 suppose il all started in college. Swarth-
more left me with an exaggerated notion of the 
extent to which ideas are valued in the academic 
world; il took two graduate schools to clear this 
up. After lhat, as far as I was concerned, 
Ph.D. stood for Poophead. But I still cared 
about ideas, and the deep necessity of finding 
their true structure and organization. From 
writing I knew the grueling difficulty of trying 
to make ideas get in order. I believed in the 
pure, white light of inspiration and the power of 
the naive but clever mind to figure out anything, 
if not obstructed but dumb dogmas and obtuse 
mental schemata fostered by the educational system. 
When I finally got the idea of what compu­
ters were about, sometime in 1960, I took endless 
walks at night trying to hash these things out and 
see where they led. The text systems came clear 
to me, at least in their beginnings; in a few weeks; 
the realization that 3D halftone was possible came 
to me as a shock the following spring, I believe 
as 1 was walking across Radeliffe Common. Since 
then trying lo build these systems for creation and 
the true ordering of intricate thought has been my 
driving dream. 
My own life among these dream machines 
has been a nightmare, thoroughly unpleasant, 
and if people are right in telling me that nobody 
wants systems like the ones I am designing, 
I'll get the heck out of this and be a disk jockey 
or a toy salesman or something. 
I first got into this as a writer; all I 
wanted was a decent writing system that would 
run on a computer. Little did I realize the im­
mensity of what that entailed, or that for some 
reason my work and approach would engender 
indignation and anger wherever I went. There 
is a fiction that everybody in these fields is 
doing something fundamentally scientific and 
technical, and this fiction is usually upheld in 
carefully enacted mutual playlets. Trying to 
cut through that and say, "Let's build a home for 
mankind that will at last be shaped to fit man's 
mind," does noi seem to-generate immediate 
warmth and welcome. 
But I'm glad for the friends I've made in 
this field, and of course there have been a lot 
of laughs. (I'd really have hated to miss being 
in this field, just for the thrilling madness of 
it all.) All in all my adventures have been a 
sort of participatory journalism, which I'd like 
to write up properly some time. Some highlights; 
The days of madness in '68, trying to 
start an honest corporation to do all this stuff, 
and suffering endless lunches with Wall Street 
hangers-on who were looking for a vehicle to 
take public. They wanted another chicken-
franchise type company, though, and certainly 
not ideas. 
Being briefed by four different corporations. 
moBt of them major, on the fantastic powers their 
interactive-movie system was going to have. One 
of these briefings was in the board room of a 
famous skyscraper. And now, only one of those 
syatems is left-- Kodak's. 
Then there was the courtly gentleman who 
was going to be my Noah Dietrich, my Colonel 
Parker. He assured me that through his business 
connections all was going to go marvelously, 
and then later intimated that as a special favor 
he was going to put me in touch with other 
universes and the flying saucer people. I just 
didn't have lime for other universes. Then there was the suppression of my first 
book (this is my second). You might say it waa 
a misunderstanding, at least on my part. My 
boss's understanding was evidently that the ad­
vancement of my ideas would be detrimental to 
his. If it had been a question of free speech in 
Yugoslavia it might have been different. Well, 
it takes a long time to get a book together, but 
here we go again. 
Then (here was the lime I was called In 
as a consultant on a vast federal system, never 
mind what. Numerous computer programs were 
to be coordinated by a hypertext system they 
had created and they wanted to know if they'd 
designed il right. It took months to find oul 
from the programmers exactly what the system 
was, so I ended up writing the manual; after 
which I explained what was wrong with the pro­
ject and the whole hypertext system was scrapped. 
And my job with it. I never quite got the swing 
of consulting 
Flying coast-lo-coast with the president 
of a large corporation, he and I planned the 
whole Xanadu budget for the following year at 
something like half a million dollars, Two years

yellow cab In New York, the miserable vehicle 
breaks down in front of those same corporate 
headquarters. And the reason I had that bad 
taxi was thai I was out of favor with the taxi 
dispatcher, on account of having been absent 
the previous week-- I had had to fly to California 
to give a banquet address at the Rand Corporation. 
Then there were my adventures with the 
CIA. 
I was sitting in my office at Vassar, 
sagely advising a studenl, when the phone rang 
und the caller identified himself as John W. 
Kuipers, head of computer research at the CIA, 
He told me I had been noticed as a new bright 
young man in the field, and would I like to 
work for them? 
Now, there is something about being a 
cynic and a romantic. (They go together: the 
cynic deflates ideas, the romantic falls in love 
with them.) It is not impossible for the cynical 
romantic to surmise that because everything he 
has seen personally turned out to be so lousy, 
that the true hope may lie at Ihe heart of the 
vortex, just where everybody thinks is impossible. 
Also the Kennedy aftermath, when sophisticated 
people had learned to laugh at simple idealism 
as a facade for the real wheel-and-dealing, 
slap-and-tickle, may have had something to do 
with it; anyway, I was enchanted. Thus began 
the Kuipers Caper. 
YES, THERE IS A McLEAN, VIRGINIA 
I was given a handler named Bob, a jolly 
fellow, who kept assuring me that much money 
was just around the corner. I was regaled with 
success stories of other people in the computer 
field who really, undercover Worked for Them. 
(They weren't doing anything very exciting.) 
I got to show my slides in the CIA office building 
in Arlington, and to see there very fancy display 
equipment behind shielded (!) double-doors in 
a shielded (!!) computer room— shielded lo keep 
any planted bugs from transmitting out the con­
tents of the computers' working registers. I even 
got to visit the main CIA "campus" in McLean, 
Virginia, where the sign says Agricultural 
Research Station. It is an incredible feeling to 
walk across that big eagle in the terrazzo, 
and to be given the visitor's badge that says 
"United States Government" all in wiggly lines. 
They told me that they would be glad to 
set me up in business as a hypertext company, 
but 1 would have to have a corporation, because 
that was the way they always did things. And so 
it came to pass that The Nelson Organization, Inc. 
was founded at the express request of the United 
States Central Intelligence Agency. I wouldn't have 
had it any other way. If life can't be pleasant it 
can at least be surrealistic. 
. . . BUT NO SANTA CLAUS 
I was encouraged to write proposals for them, 
and write proposals I did. (I happened to finish 
typing the first one during a lightning storm, 
and lightning crashed just as I was signing the 
page; 1 felt like Faust.) I explained how hyper­
text might have prevented the Bay of Pigs. After 
due consideration, I did not say what hypertexts 
might have done for the Warren Report. Numerous 
jolly phone calls assured me that my first $25,000 
was just around the corper. 
The break came when Bob called me and 
asked me to rewrite a proposal one more time. 
He had circulated it, he said, among various 
people "at the shop," who he reminded me were 
holders of advanced degrees, and it had been 
remarked that they found my proposal meaning­
less: "Every place you say 'hypertext' you 
could just as well put 'gobbledygook' instead; 
you'll have to clear that up a Utile." That did It. They couldn't read either. 
Who turns out to be in charge of computer stuff 
in the heart of the CIA, the inner sanctum, the 
neat of vipers, but the same old poopy Ph.Ds. 
1 decided to resuscitate my virtue. 
As far as 1 know, there ia still not a 
Decent Writing System anywhere in the world, 
although several things now come close. It 
seems a shame that grown men and women have 
to rustle around in piles of paper, like squirrels 
looking for acorns, in search of the phrases 
and ideas they themselves have generated. 
The decent writing system, as I see it, will 
actually be much more: it will help us create 
better things in a fraction of the time, but also 
keep track of everything in better and more 
subtle ways than we ever could before. 
But nobody sees this-- I suppose it's only 
writers and editors that know they're trying to 
"keep track of ideas"-- and I have been unable 
to get thia across to anybody. (The professional 
writers, of course, won't talk to me either.) 
So here 1 am after fourteen years with 
exactly two systems to show for it: the main one, 
Xanadu, the text-and-animated-picture network 
system, and Fantasm (I shouldn't have spent 
the time but it was a labor of love), the simu­
lated-photography system. Actually, I don't 
have either of them to show, it's all just flow­
charts, but it turns out that if I work on either 
of them with university equipment, my work of 
fourteen years gets confiscated. So much for 
that; the outside expedients for debugging con­
tinue. 
And, to lighten the burden, I've finally 
given up on trying to reach professionals, who 
evidently need a thick gravy of technicalism to 
make the obvious palatable; with this bookity 
I am taking my case to The People. It is there, 
anyway, out in Consumerdom, that the real ac­
tion is going to occur. So the important thing 
is for everybody to know what's really possible, 
and what they could have. That is why 1 have 
shot off my big canons (and this epistol). 
To me, you see, this is really a holy 
crusade, whereas I know guys lo whom it's 
just a living. It's no less than a question 
of freedom in our time. The cases of Solzhenitsyn 
and Ellsberg remind us that freedom is still 
not what it should be, anywhere. Computer 
display and storage can bring us a whole new 
literature, the uniting and the apotheosis of the 
old and the new; but there are many who would 
not necessarily want to see this come about. 
Deep and widespread computer systems would be 
tempting to two dangerous parties, "organized , 
crime" and the Executive branch of the Federal 
government (assuming there is still a difference 
between the two). If we are to have the freedoms 
of information we deserve as a free people, the 
safeguards have to be built in at the bottom, now. 
And the opulence which is possible must be made 
clear to everyone before we settle on an inferior 
system— as we did with television. 
Some people have called my ideas and 
systems "Orwellian." This is annoying in two 
ways. In the first place it suggests the night­
mare of Orwell's book Nineteen Eighly-Four, 
which obviously I want no part of. (But hey, 
do you remember what that world of 1964 was 
actually like? The cryptic wars against unseen 
enemies that kept shifting? The government 
spying? The use of language to twist and 
manipulate? To paraphrase Huey Long: "Of 
course we'll have 1984 in America. Only we'll 
call it 1972.") 
The second reason the term "Orwellian" 
is offensive is that it somehow reduces the life 
of Orwell, the man, to the world of "1984." 
This is a shallow and shabby thing to do to a 
man who spent his life unmasking oppressiveness 
in human institutions everywhere. 
In the larger sense, then-- in homage to 
that simple, honest, angry man, who cared about 
nothing more than human freedom-- I would be 
proud indeed if my systems could be called 
Orwellian. 
That reminds me. Nowhere in the book 
have I defined Ihe phrase "computer lib." By 
Computer Lib I mean simply: making people 
freer through computers. That's all. 
Fantically-- or fanatically--
Yours for a better world, 
Before we have to settle for Any--

One of the world's most exclusive clubs 
is also one of its moat dismal. It la The Club 
ot Rome, founded by Italian businessman Aurelio 
Peceet. having- Cas of 1973) aome seventy mem­
bers from twenty-five countries. 
Their concern they call The Predicament 
of Mankind, or the "problematique." It ia the 
problem of growth, pollution, population, and 
What's Happening in general. 
On funds from Volkswagen, they have 
sponsored studies which thinking; men con only 
regard as the most dismal in portent of anything 
we've seen in years. Or ever. 
Basically the prediction is that mankind 
haa perhaps forty or fifty years left. 
Not because of war, or bombs, or dirty 
movies, or Divine retribution, but for simple 
economic reasons. However, the studies are 
often called "computer studies," because compu­
ters are the viewing mechanism by which we 
have come to see these coming events. 
MALTHUS AGAIN 
In the nineteenth century, a pessimistic 
economist named Thomas Malthus predicted that 
there would always be starving people, because 
people increased geometrically-- expanding at 
compound interest, with a fixed rate of increase 
creating an ever-steeper growth-- while agricul­
tural production, which must feed us all, expands 
arithmetically, not as a rate but a few acres or 
improvements at a lime. 
This meant, Malthus thought, thst there 
would always be the starving poor. For various 
reasons this did not happen in Europe. But the 
regrettable soundness of the general principle 
persists: when rates of food production can't 
nearly keep up with rates of population growth, 
people are going to starve. 
This is basically the prediction. 
DYNAMIC MODELLING 
Basically what has happened is this. One 
Jay Forrester, of MIT. has for some years been 
studying "dynamic models" of things, a new 
breed of simulation which couldn't have been 
done without computer*. And now dynamic 
models of the world's entire economic system 
can be crested and tried out. 
Basically dynamic models are mathematical 
complexes where things change at rales that 
change themselves over time. For instance, the 
more you eat. the fatter you get, and the fatter 
you gel, the hungrier you are going lo be. Now, 
jus,l because this is simple lo say in words, and 
sounds aa though mathematicians would have had 
solved the whole class of problems centuries ago, 
that's not how it ia. The intricacy of such 
models, even for juel a few variables, made lt 
impossible to foresee what happens in such com­
plexes exact by techniques of computer enactment. 
Forrester, who has studied such syatems since 
the fifties, has become alert to their problems 
and surprises. The culmination of his work has 
been a model of the entire world's economic 
growth, agriculture, population, Industrialization 
and pollution: this la described in his book 
World Dynamics (Wright-Allen. 1971). 
The sidii . portents of Forres-
ier-s work did not go unnoticed. The 
dangers of population increasing at com­
pound interest on a planet of unchanging 
size, and further derivatives of these 
changes, suggested that things might be 
getting worse than anybody thought. An 
alert Italian businessman brought togeth­
er a group of scholars from all over the 
world to study these problems, and called 
the group The Club of Rome. Their first 
work is out now, and it is very scary 
and all too real. The book is called The 
Limits to Growth. 
Basically what they have done is a 
very elaborate computer simulation, 
modelling the entire economy of the planet 
in the years to come as a structure of 
rates. They have taken into account 
population, food-growing capacity, indus­
trial growth, pollution, and a lot of 
other things. The model is precise and 
elaborate. 
They tried all kinds of altcrnati 
futures using the model-- what would 
happen if the birth rates were differ* 
What if there were no pollution? Whai 
if resources were infinite? 
According to all the simulations 
the human race will be wiped out-- mostly 
or completely-- by the year 2100. 
Let's go briefly through the model. 
Note that it can't be exact, and we can't 
know what years things are going to hap­
pen. The curves themselves-- the shape 
of things to come-- tell the story all 
too clearly. (For those who would like 
a little more drama with their numbers, 
finding these matters too abstract, I 
strongly recommend the very beautiful 
Indian film "Distant Thunder," a sort of 
"Mr. Smith Starves to Death." Or just 
stick around awhile.) 
HUIIT 
The model assumes that birth rates 
stay relatively constant in particular 
parts of the world, and that new land 
and agricultural techniques increase food 
production in relatively well-understood 
wars. 
Of course, population continues to 
go up, on the familiar but deadly curve. Civilisation, and the bulk of mankind, 
have about forty years to live, according to 
certain studies (see p. 6 5). The studies 
are depresstngly good, although unfinished. 
There are four possible things to do. 
1. Ignore it. 
2. Deny it. 
4. The glorious flameout. Est, drink 
and be merry. Tor tomorrow we die. Or 
apocalyptic occultism, or whatever. 
5. Work starting now. In whatever 
directions might, just might, point or con­
tribute to a way out. 
Now for the bad news. The running 
ratio of food to people, Food per Capita, 
takes n sudden nosc-dive. And then so 
does population. 
It Is not any individual prediction lhat is 
frightening, since the numbers plugged into the 
separate runs are merely hypotheses, lo show 
the shape of the consequences. It Is the overall 
set of runs that is so ghastly, because they si-
ways come out the same. 
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION 
Now, it 16 important to clarify what is 
happening here and what is not. What is not 
happening: an oracular pronouncement by "the 
computer," showing some transcendental predic­
tion by a superhuman intelligence. What is hap­
pening: people are trying out separate possible 
assumptions lo see what their consequences are, 
enacted by the computer according to the economic 
rules Ihcy set up. Result: always the seme. 
Any set of rules, played out in the unstable 
exploding-population world beyond the seventies, 
appears lo have similarly dire results. 
WHAT HOPE IS THERE? 
The original model is only an approxima­
tion, and the basic results, aa published in The 
Limits to Growth (ace box) reflect those approx­
imations. One of the things thai can be done is 
to fill in and expand the model mare, to see 
whether any hopes can be found in the details 
and fine cracks which don't appear from the 
gToas results. And, of course, to study and 
re-study the basic findings. (For instance, a 
small error was recently found: a decimal point 
was misplaced in the "pollution" calculation, 
leading tc an overstatement of the pollution in 
aome of the runs. (Bul pollution, remember. Is 
only part of the problem,) 
So there you arc. Thia is a study of the 
greatest importance. We may, just may, be get­
ting wind of things in time to change the outcome. 
(If only we knew now. But again, this study 
is where serious discussion must begin.) 
IBM IS BULLISH ON THE FUTURE 
Lewis M. B r an scorn b. who haa the awe­
some title of Chief Scientist of IBM. has been 
giving numerous talks recently thai seem to be 
directed against pessimism resulting from the 
Club of Rome studies. 
"'On the shoulders of the Information 
processing community reals the responsi­
bility tor convincing the public that we 
have the tools, if it ha* the will, to ad-
dreas the complex systems management 
problems of the future,' Uranacomb said. 
"'More lhan any other profession 
our community can restore the public's 
confidence that from tha limited resources 
of the world can be fashioned a life of 
well managed abundance fur all.' he 
concluded." Now begins the winter of the world. 
We are pot toning everything. 
With so little time left, we are of course 
expanding and accelerating every form of pollution 
and destruction. 
We are killing the last ot our beautiful 
brothers, the whales. Just to provide marginal 
amortization of the whale-ships that are going 
to be scrapped anyway. 
Set down upon this beautiful planet, a 
garden spot of the universe, we are turning It 
into a poisoned pigsty . 
You and I may starve to deaih, dear reader. 
In some year fairly aoon now, around the turn of 
the century, there will no longer be nearly e-
noubh food for the teeming billions. 
Thai, anyway, is what Ihe predictions say. 
The predictions are compelling, not because a 
computer made them -- anybody can make a com­
puter predict anything - but because the prem­
ises from which the predictions grow were 
very well thought oul. 
It i a us to make ihe prcdlctio 
Not by killing the bearer of bad tidings, 
or by pretending they were not clearly stated--
but by seeing what possible alternatives remain 
in the few moments of real choice we may yet 
have-- scant years at best. 
To haggle now about ideology ia like ar­
guing about who is driving while we are headed 
toward a brick wall with ihe gas pedal jammed 
to the floor. 
The public thinks, "science will save us," 
a view at which many scientists, snicker bitterly. 
Perhaps wc will be shrunk to an inch's height, 
or fed on rocks, or given gills and super-kidneys 
to live in the ever-mcre-poisoned sea. Or per­
haps wc will do what science says others have 
done: die out. 
This science-will-save-us ostrich-position 
is nicely exemplified by Albert Rosenfeld. Science 
Editor Of Saturday Review/World. 
Since "science" has given us the Boeing 
747 snd the neutrino, neither of which could 
once, he thinks, have been imagined possible, 
obviously (to him) science can do anything else 
we think is impossible! He fully imagines lhat 
science will come up with something lo take 
care of geometrically Increasing numbers of 
people. In perpetuity? 
"Take a lesson from the neutrino," he 
says. "We can solve our problems." ("Look 
to the Neutrino. Thou Doomssyer," Saturday 
Review/World, Feb 23 1974. 47.) 
OTHER FUN 
The growing diffusion of weapons and 
grudges, and Ihe great vulnerability of almost 
everything, assure that terrorism and political 
extortion will will increase dramatically for 
the foreseeable future. On the other hand, 
whole economic blocs and industries have 
lately mask red and demonstrated by example 
how to hold the country at bay in order to

after life ends there. 
But even if everything else were all righl, 
the Breeder Reactor* are sure to gel ua. I refer 
to those wonder machines that the electric com­
panies are calling Clean Energy for the Future. 
What is not explained wilh such slogans is lhat 
breeder reactors noi only create energy, Ihey 
create atomic waste, breeding new fissionable 
material-- including plutonium. Plutonium is 
well named for the gcd of hell. Chemically a 
poison and radloactlvely a horror. II does noi 
go away; wherever we pul it. it will get back 
to us. 
The mere radiation from the atomic crap 
is hardly the problem. The radioactive poisons 
are getting into Ihe oceans. They are getting 
into the clean walera of Ihe land. (A December 
1071 new* report, for Instance, revealed thai 
a DBS leak of radioactive chemicals wa* into 
Ihe water aupply of Bloomfield, Colorado.) Now, 
atomic enthusiasts call It a Disposal Problem.

But it's a very different problem. Wherever we

not be guaranteed against earthquake and re­

That's the kicker. With more and more 
fissionable crud being disgorged. its availability

Ihe stuff wa* shipped in unguarded trucks, and 
one or two good hijacking* would enable *ny 
bright kid to build his own dirty A-bomb. By 
the year 7000 it ia not inconceivable thst bootleg 
atomic weapons will be as widespread as hand­
gun* in Detroit-- and as much used. 
But now, wilh the breeder .reactor*-- ir 
lots of countries-- pouring the stuff out. the era 
of atomic plenty is here. The amaller countries 
who want them are getting their atomic weapons 
- though holding back assembly of the part*, 
for variouB reasons. It ia generally believed 
among bomb-watchers, for instance, that India 
and Israel hove theirB anytime they want. 
Add this to the great avalanche of missiles, 
tall and horny in their silos, reedy to go on two, 
later three or four, side*. (The U.S. official 
arsenal now stands at the explosive equivalent 
of 5 billion tens of TNT, a ton or TNT for every 
human being. And that's just the explosive part, 
not the fallout; a fraction of these bombs could 
destroy all life on earth by its seething residue.) 
And now. because of the SALT talks, we may 
expect a new and drastic increose of this Readiness 
Posture. Hoo boy. What is then* tt suy . 
So there it is, folks, merry times ahead. 
Human it> may end with a bang (thermonuclear 
exchanges, or just desultory firings urtil we're

sttrvniion). or, I would anticipate, some spastic 
combination of the two. and all within the (pos­
sible) lifetime of the average reader. Thi* Is. 
at any rate, what 1 think most likely. 
Except of course we won't see it happen 
that way. We'll watch the starvations on TV 
(as we did Biafra, Bangladesh, now West Africa, 
what next... India?), and tsk about the poor 
foreigners who can't take cere of themselves. 
And as the problems increase and move toward 
oui heartland, it'll be blamed on environmentalists 
and on the news media, till bang. 
Just maybe. 
But we've all got to get access lo Ihe Club 
of Home models, and look (or holes or strategies. 
If computer modelling system doing this kind of 
work are made widely enough available, perhaps 
some precocious grade-schooler or owlish hobbyist 
will find some way out that the others haven't

ailed 
Would you believe thst the greatest avail­
able computer service ie for the kiddles? 
For four bucks and a half, an outfit called 
Me-Books will send, to a child you designate, 
a story of which he is the hero, in which his 
friends and siblings appear, and whose action 
involves his address and birthday. 
Kids adore it. Children who don't like 
reading treasure the volumes; children who do 
like reading love them just as much. 
[ can personally report, at least on the 
basis of the one I ordered (My Friendly Giraffe) 
that the story is beautifully thought out. warm, 
loving, and cleverly plotted. In other words, 
far from being a fast-buck scheme, this thing 
has been done right. It's a splendid children's 
story, fl won't reveal the plot, but the Giraffe's 
birthday, name and home address are related 
to those of the protagonist.) 
Moreover, it has three-color illustrations, 
is on extra-heavy paper and is bound in hard 
covers. 
(In case you're interested, any of the 
three programming languages expounded earlier 
in the book would be suitable for creating a 
Me-Book: depending on the language chosen, 
the holes left for the child's own name would be 
alphabetic variables, segment gaps or null arrays 
-- anyhow, you could do it.) 
Astute readers of the Me-Book will note 
that while it's not readily obvious, only the lines 
on which personalized information appear have 
been printed in the computer's lineprinter. The 
others have all been pre-printed on a press. 
Indeed, the personalizations appear on only one 
side of each page, the whole book being one 
long web of paper that's run through the line-
printer just once before being cut and bound. 
But it's so cleverly written and laid out that the 
story moves on beautifully even on the pages 
that don't mention the child's name. 
As an experiment, the author tried sending 
for a copy of My_ Friendly Giraffe as told about 
a little boy named Tricky Dick Nixon, residing

it Ituooi* <«„IIQMISI About these fanny numbers 
cnycup checks. 
You will note that all bank checka now 
have funny-looking numbers along their bottoms 
They go like this: 
O 12314 5 &?n'q 
0 »• \f / 
The numbers are odd but recognizable. 
The last four thingies are punctuation marks, 
which presumably can mean anything the pro­
grammer wants them to. (In other words, 
frankly, I don't know their names or standard 
functions.) 
The name of these numbers is MIGR which stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recor­
ding. They are printed in magnetic ink - not 
magnetic so's you could record on it, like mag­
netic tape, but chock-full of iron and vitamins 
so that as its blobs whiz past a special read 
head, they cause a specific sequence of pulseB 
in the parallel circuits of the read head that can 
be decoded as the specific number or mark. 
The MICR system was designed in the 
late fifties, with the technology convenient at 
that time, and would certainly not be designed 
that way now. Nevertheless, these weird-looking 
symbols have inspired various 
BIDOLQJS TVPE-fflCES, 
which apparently look to the public like the 
latest hotcha whizbang zippity up-to-date futur­
istic stuff, even though to the knowledgeable 
person they bring back the late fifties. (In 
fact there are no letters in the MICR character-
set.) 
What, then (you may ask) would symbols 
designed for computers look like if they had 
been designed more recently? 
We were just getting to that. In fact, 
there are two such alphabets, called OCR (for 
Optical Character Recognition). They have 
been standardized so everybody can design 
equipment and/or programs to work with them. 
They are called the A and B optical fonts, or, 
for completeness, OCR(A) and OCR(B). 
They are very diaappointing. 
OCR(A) is a little sexier. At least it 
looks like something. (Evidently it's slightly 
easier to deal wilh and design for.) But the 
other one, OCR(B), just looks like the alphabet 
next door. Here they are.

THE 5SS 
The national phone company (usually 
called affectionately, "Ma Bell") has drastically 
changed its switching methods in the last few 
years. They are replacing the old electromech­
anical switches, or "crossbars," with a new 
device called the ESS, or Electronic Switching 
System. If there's one in your area you may 
hear about it in their jolly news sheet that you 
ret with the bill. 
In the old crossbar dsys, a phone con­
nection was a phone connection and that was 
that. Now, with the ESS, all sorts of new com­
binations are possible: the ESS has stored pro­
grams that determine its operation. If you 
dialled a non-working number, it jumps to a 
program to take care of that. It does all sorts 
of things by special program, and new programs 
can be created for special purposes. Now the 
phone company is trying to find the services 
that people will pay for. Having calls rerouted 
temporarily to other numbers? Linking up 
several people in a conference call? Storing 
your most-called numbers, so you can reach 
them with a single or double digit? 
These particular services are now being 
offered experimentally. 
The way it works is this: there are a 
number of programs stored in a core memory; 
the only "output device" of the system consists 
of its field of reed switches, arranged to close 
circuits of the telephone network. 
Depending on the numbers that have been 
dialled, and whatnot, the ESS jumps to a specific 
program, and that tells it to connect an incoming 
call to particular other circuits, or to ring other 
lines, or whatever. 
It's really neat. 
There are only a couple of things to worry 
about. 
One is that it makes wiretapping, not a 
complex bother involving clipped wires and men 
hunched over in cramped spaces, but a simple 
program. 
Another is that some people think that 
blue-boxers (see nearby) may be able to program 
it, from the comfort of their own homes. Mean­
ing that not just court-authorized wiretaps, but 
Joe Schmoe wiretaps, would be possible. Let's 
hope not. 
13 This has been around for decades, and 
has nothing to do with computers, but isn't it 
You write with a pen attached by rods 
to a transmitter; somewhere else, a pen attached 
by rods to a receiver duplicates what you have 
written. 
What is being transmitted consists of the 
measured sideways motion ("change in x") , the 
measured up-and-down motion ("change in y"), 
and the condition of the pen ("up" or "down"). 
What would these days be called "three analog 
channels, multiplexed on a single line." 
These only cost a couple of hundred dollars. 
Why has nobody been using them for computer 
input? Minicomputers handle various

various automatic sensors around each house sniff

The system uses dual Novas (one a backup),

If you want to put together your own computer-on-a-chip, 
or any other complex integrated circuit, a complete simulation-
verification-layout-and-fabrication service is available from 
Motorola, Semiconductor Products Div. . P.O. Box 20924, Phoenix, 
Arizona. Presumably it costs a mint, but after that you can roll 
out your circuits like cookies. 
Your circuit is overlaid on their beehive-chip of logical 
subcircuits, called a Polycell. You use their MAGIC language 
(Motorola Automatically Generated Integrated Circuits), which 
then feeds a resulting circuit data structure to a program called 
SIMUL8 (yuk yuk) to try out the circuit without building it. 
That way you can suppoaedly be aure before they make the final 
masks. 
I always figured that the day of Computer 
Hobbyism would arrive when the folks at Heathkit 
offered a build-it-yourself computer. But you 
know what they came out with instead last year? 
A general interface for hooking things to the PDP-8. a swell video game now in bars, probably 
controls the four-player pingpong on the screen 
with a minicomputer or microprocessor. 
Especially exciting is the social possi­
bility of horizontal screens for other fun inter­
personal stuff. As well as collaborative work.

The thing is, he presents a paper on the thermo­

ASTROPLASH. etc. 
There are various computerized astrology 
services. Given your date of birth, and hour 
if known, they'll type out your signs, explan­
ations, etc. Presumably there is a text network 
which the system selects among according to 
"reinforcing tendencies," etc., among the entities 
thought to be influential. 
Conceivably this could do nine-tenths of 
what a talented human astrologer does, and with 
the same validity, whatever that may be. In 
any case It's probably a lot cheaper. This is an outrageous misnomer. The 
computer Is only carrying out, most speedily, 
what hardened politocoes have always done: 
FACTIONAL ANALYSIS, now possible with new­
found precision on the basis of certain election 
returns. 
Is it too soon for a 
computer pornography contest? 
(Is it too late7) 
See p. t>^"3V' This is based on the cynical, and fairly 
reliable, view that people vote according to 
what faction of the greater populace they belong 
to-- middle-class white liberals, blue-collar 
non-union members, and so on. The factions 
change slowly over time, and people move 
among them, but the fact of factionalism remains 
unchanged. 
Well. By the close of a major election 
campaign, most factions can be pretty well pre­
dicted, especially as to presidential choice, or 
what proportion of that faction will go for a 
given candidate. 
But some factions' reactions are not cer­
tain up to the day of the ballot. 
So. "Computer predictions" of elections 
basically break the country into its factional 
divisions, state by state and district by district, 
and then tabulate who can be predicted to vote 
fof whom on a factional basis. 
Then what's the suspense? 
The suspense comes from the uncertain 
factions— groups whose final reactions aren't 
known as the election starts. 
People think computers are rigid 
and invariant. This (as stated else­
where In this book) is due to the systems 
which people have imposed, and then 
blamed, on the computer. 
The fact is that computers are now 
being set up to give new flexibility to 
manufacturing processes. Computers, 
directly connected to milling machines, 
grind metal into any conceivable shape 
much faster than a human craftsman. To 
change the result, change the program--
in a fraction of a second. Fabric des­
ign has been done on computer screens; 
the obvious next step is to have the 
computer control the loom or knitting 
machine and immediately produce what-
ever's been designed. 
Custom clothing: soon we may look 
forward to tailoring services that store 
your measurements and can custom-tailor 
a suit for you to any new fashion, in 
minutes. (But will the price beat Hong 
Kong?) Customized printed matter is 
already here (see "Me-Books," p. 6)-
Wherever people want individual varia­
tions of a basic manufacturing process, 
computers can do it. 
The Telephone Company (at least in 
Illinois and Indiana) offers a speaker on 
"The Shadowy World of Electronic Snooping" 
to interested groups. Certain election districts are known to 
be chock full of the types of people whose reac­
tion isn't known. 
The final "computer prediction" simply 
consists of checking out how those districts 
voted, concluding how those factions are going 
in the present election, and extending this pro­
portion through the rest of the country. 
It's often painfully accurate— but, thank 
god. not always. When it isn't don't blame 
"the computer." Thank human cantankerosity. 
may or may not be a real computer-- friends 
have told me it isn't— but it's certainly a good 
idea. 
When you pull your late-model Volkswagen 
into a dealer's service area, the guys can just 
roll out a cable and plug it into the corresponr 
ding socket in your vehicle. At the other end 
of the cable is some sort of device which tests 
a series of special circuits throughout the car 
for Good Condition. These circuits indicate 
that things are working properly-- lights, plugs, 
points, brakes and so on. 
This is the same technique used by NASA 
up to the final moment of COMMIT LAUNCH-- a 
system of circuits monitors the conditions of 
whatever can be monitored, to make sure all's 
functioning well. It's more expensive to wire it 
up that way, but it makes checking out the 
rocket-- or the car— that much easier.

the card into an Entrance Machine, which pre­

Secrecy of the recording code is an impor­
tant aspect of the thing. Indeed, waggish gossip

the card can be washed clean with a magnet by 
larcenous commuters. But this seems unlikely. YOUR AUTOMOBILE COMPUTER

computers in our cars? We refer here to two 
things— 
anti-skid controllers. which are really 
just special circuits-- you know, 
"analog computers"— to compensate 
among skidding wheels. Turns out 
that this is apparently more sensi­
tive and reliable than even your good 
drivers who enjoy controlling skids.

grand bus electronics (see p. ). Since 
the electrical part of the automobile 
is getting so blamed complicated, 
the Detroit Ironmongers have decided 
to switch to a grand bus structure 
instead of having all those switches 
and things separate anymore. Should 
make the whole thing far easier to 
service and customize. 
Presumably this will all be 
under the control of a microprocessor. 
(See p-^^j ) This means that the 
car can have things like a Cold-
Weather Startup Sequence-- a program 
that starts the car, turns on the 
heater, monitors the engine and 
cabin temperature, and bleats the 
horn, twice, politely when it's all 
ready-- all at a time preset by the 
dashboard clock. 
Presumably Detroit is not yet 
planning to go this far. But because 
of the auto industry's anomalously 
huge influence in America, some have 
expressed the fear that this move

would effectively put Detroit in con­
trol of the entire electronics industry. 
The ever-clever Japanese are computerizing 
faster, better and more deeply than we are. 
They now have a prototype taxi operating 
under computer control. They're calling it, at 
least for export, Computer-controlled Vehicle 
System (CVS). 
Basically it's like an Elevated Railway--
you climb up and wait-- but when you gel in. 
you punch a button for your destination. Accor­
ding to Hideyuki Hayashi of the Ministry of In­
dustry and International Trade, the system will 
be operational in Tokyo within the decade, and 
is the "cleanest, safest, quickest transport sys­
tem ever devised by man." Think fast, Detroit. 
(A nice point: one of the most important 
features of such a system ia that the vehicles 
don't react to each other, as do vehicles in the 
existing Human-controlled Vehicle System (HVS). 
A whole line of the cars can be accelerated or 
slowed simultaneously, a crucial aspect of their 
flexibility and safety. Nothing can possibry 
go long.)

THOSE THINGS ON THE RAILROAD CARS 
As we lean on the fence a-chawin' an' 
a-watchin' the trains go by. we note strange 
insignia on their sides, in highly reflective 
Scotch-Lite all begrimed by travel. 
Basically it's a stack of horizontal stripes 
in red, blue and other colors. This la ACI, 
for Automatic Car Idenliflcation. It may yet 
straighten out the railroads. 
In this neolithic industry, it is not known 
at any given time where a railroad company's 
cars are, and some peculiar etiquette governs 
their unrequested uBe by other firms in the 
industry. Yet the obvious solution may come 
about: a running inventory of where all the cars 
are. where each one is going, whet's in it. 
and who thst belongs to. But. of course, that's 
still in the works. Revolutionary ideas take time.

Everywhere you go computers lurk. Yet 
they wear so many faces it's impossible to figure 
what's going on. 
Guidelines are hard to lay down here, but 
if you look for examples of things you've alresdy 
run into in this book, it may help some. 
Terminals you can presumably recognize. 
Microprocessors are harder, because you 
don't see them. Good rule-of-thumb: any device 
which acts with complexity or apparent discretion 
presumably incorporates a terminal, minicomputer 
or microprocessor. 
Two other things to watch for: transaction 
systems and data base systems. 
A transaction system is any syatem that 
takes note of, and perhaps requires verification 
of, transactions. Example: the new point-of-sale 
systems (POS) . This is what's about to replace 
the cash register. 
In the supermarket of the future, every 
package will have a bar code on a sticker, or 
printed on the wrapper. Instead of the checkout 
clerk looking at the label and punching the a-
mount of the sale into the cash register— an 
error-prone and cheat-prone technique which 
requires considerable training— your New Im­
proved Checkout Clerk will wave a wand over 
the bar code. The bar code will be sensed by 
the wand, and transmitted to a control computer, 
which will ring it up by amount and category 
(for tax purposes), and even keep track of 
inventory. noting each object as it is removed 
from stock. 
Here is what your bar code will look like. 
(A circular code, which was already turning up 
on some TV dinners, has been eliminated by the 
bar code. This is unfortunate, since the scan­
ner necessary to read the bar code is electron­
ically more complicated, but there we are.) 
I 
(Incidentally, while this does arrest the 
classic cashier's cheat-- ringing up excessive 
purchases on the customers, then having a con­
federate walk through equivalent amounts— the 
consumer is still entirely prone to cheating by 
the store in the computer program. Remember, 
it's 1974. So you still may have to check your 
tapes, folks.) 
Data base systems are any systems which 
keep track of a whole lot of stuff, often with 
complex pointer techniques (see "Data Structures," 
P- Z£>). A cute example is the message service 
now offered by Stuckey's snack/souvenir stands 
all over the country. You may leave messages 
for your friends or loved ones on the road; they 
can stop at any Stuckey's and ask for their 
messages, just as if it was a telephone answering 
service. (You're listed by your phone number-
is this to avoid pranks? And what about people 
with no phones?) It's free and a neat idea. 
(Obviously, the messages are stored on the disk 
of a big central computer, and queried from 
terminals at the individual stands.) 
Now, moat of the big systems you run into 
tend to be a combination of transaction and 
data-base system. For instance, suppose you 
make an airline reservation. The airline has a 
large data base to keep track of: the inventory 
of all those armchairs it's flying around the 
country, and the list of who so far have announced 
plans to sit in them, and in some cases what 
they intend to eat. When you buy your ticket 
that transaction then gets you put In the listing. 
Same for car rentals and so on. The potential dangers of transaction systems 
are fairly obvious from the supermarket example, 
but they fan out in greater complexity as the 
systems get more complex. Credit cards, for 
instance, were only made possible by computers 
and computerized credit verification; but it is 
only now, fifteen or so years into the credit-card 
era, that laws protect the cardholder against 
unlimited liability if he loses it. 
Yet we plunge ahead, and it is obvious why. 
Transaction systems managed in, and by, com­
puters allow more flexible and (in principle) 
reliable operations. For instance, in the secu­
rities business, thousands of stock certificates 
are lost and mislaid, and the transaction paper 
must be typed, shuffled, put in envelopes, sent, 
opened, shuffled again, compared... all by hand. 
Little wonder they're working on an Automated 
Stock Exchange System. But if it's taken fifteen 
years to get the implicit bugs out of credit cards 
... not to mention the frequent allegations that 
much Wall Street "inefficiency" is actually the 
disguised marauding of Organized Crime. . . 
uh-oh. {If they can buy the best lawyers, they 
can probably buy the best programmers.) 
Then there is the Checkless Society. This 
is a catchphrase for an oft-advocated system that 
allows you to transfer money instantly by compu­
ter; supposedly some such thing is working al­
ready in France. Again, they better get it pretty 
safe before a sane man will go up in it. 
The safety of such systems is of course 
a matter of immense general concern. IBM 
portentiously (sic) announced its intent to spend 
millions of dollars on "computer security" a few 
years ago. However, a few million dollars is 
not going to plug the security holes in the IBM 
360, and evidently the 370 is just about as vul­
nerable . 
(In this light, even the greatest IBM-haters 
will have to admit that there may be a proper 
motive behind IBM's current refusal to let others 
use its new operating system language: that way 
they may be able to prevent special holes in the 
system from becoming known to programmers.) 
It is interesting that one profession seems 
to be stepping forward to try to improve this 
situation: the auditing profession, devoted to 
verification of financial situations of companies, 
seems to be branching into the verification of 
computer programs and the performance of com­
plex systems. This will be great, if it works. 
Cynics, however, may note that auditors have 
permitted some remarkable practices in the 
"creative" accounting of recent years. (Obvious­
ly the way to check out the safety of big systems 
is to offer bounty to those who can break its 
security. But who is willing to subject a system 
to a test like that?) 
Hereabouts are a few other computerish 
things you may run into which more or less 
defy categorization. should of course be called MATCHUP DATING, 
since there ia nothing particularly computerish 
about either the process or its intended result. 
But there we go again: word-magic, the impli­
cit authority of invoking the word Computer. 
(See "Cybercrud," p. .) 
In the early sixties, a perky young fella 
at the Harvard B-School, I believe, one Jeff Tarr, 
came up with the notion of a computerized dating 
service. The result was Operation Match, an 
immense financial success, which sort of came 
and went. No followup studies were ever done 
or success statistics gathered, unfortunately, 
but they certainly had their fun. 
The basic principle of "computer dating" 
is perfectly straightforward. Applicants send in 
descriptions of themselves and the prospective 
dates they would like to meet. The computer 
program simply does automatically the sorts of 
thing you would do if you did this by hand: 
it attempts to find the "best'1 match betweeen 
what everybody wants and what's on hand. 
THE COMPUTER GRAVEYARD 
In the mid-sixties there was a junkyard 
in Kingston, N.Y. that was like an automobile 
graveyard-- except piled high with dead com­
puters . 
They were from various manufacturers. 
The guys would smash them with sledgehammers, 
or other awful things, to make sure they could 
never work again. Then you could buy the 
circuit cards. I saw 1401s five high, Univac 
File Computers, tape drives... it was an elec­
tronic nut's paradise. You could decorate your 
den with huge old control panels, mag disks 
and whatnot, lt seems to be gone now. They 
forbade pictures. Obviously this could be a matter for 
serious operations research: attempting to dis­
cover the best matchup techniques among things 
that never really fit together, detail for detail; 
trying to find out, by followup questionnaires, 
what trait-matchings seemed to produce the best 
result, etc. But such serious matchup-function 
research remains, so far as I know, to be even 
begun. 
Obviously there are several problems. 
Demographically it is almost never true that 
"for every man there's a woman"— in every 
age-bracket there's almost always an imbalance 
of the opposite sex in the corresponding eligible 
age-bracket, either too many or too few. But 
more than that, there is little likelihood that 
the traits women want are adequately represen­
ted among the available males, or vice versa. 
For introduction services it's obviously worse: 
there is no balance likely between what comes 
in one door and what comes in the other. The 
service can only do its best with the available 
pool of people-- and make believe it's somehow 
made ideal by the use of the computer. It's 
like an employment office: applicants don't 
match openings. 
Numerous other dating services have ap­
peared, some of which don't even pretend to 
use the computer (and others which claim to 
be a registry for nonstandard sexual appetites), 
but none that's gotten the attention of the orig­
inal Project Match.

A device called the BIO-COMPUTER (trade

The question with all such special purpose

One possibility, nice and expensive, is to 
rent a number of mailing lists from a single 
mailing-list house, with them guaranteeing that 
they'll compare all the lists you choose and 
not send to any person more than once. 
But as you may be suspecting, this costs 
money. All this screening and intercomparing 
requires computer time, and so, even though 
you are getting a more and more perfect mailing, 
you are paying more and more and more money 
for it. So you can see why reasonable business­
men are willing to send out ads even when they 
know some recipients will get several duplicates. 
Another interesting point. There are 
mailing lists for all kinds of different possible 
customers. The possibilities are endless.

THEN there are those advertisements that 
are actually printed by the computer, or at least 
certain lines are filled in with the recipient's

him think it's a personal letter. Who responds 
to such things I don't know. My favorite was 
the one-- I wish I could find it to include here 
— that went something like

I don't know whether I enjoyed the spaces or 
the Main Street more. 
But you see how this works. There's 
this batch-processing program, see, and the 
names and addresses are on one long tape, and 
the tape goes through, and the program takes 
one record (a name and address), and decides 
whether to call the addressee "Mr.," "Ms." or 
whatever, and then plugs his name into the 
printout lines that give it That Personal Touch; 
and then the mailing envelope or sticker is 
printed; and the tape moves on to the next 
record. 
We may look forward to increasing en­
croachments on our time and trust by the direct 
mail industry: especially in better and better 
quack letters that look as though they've really 
been personally typed to you by a real human 
being. (It is apparently legal for letters to be 
signed by a fictitious person within a company.) 
In the future we may expect such letters to be 
sent on fine paper, typed individually on good 
typewriters, and convincingly phrased to make

New York, NY 10017 
They will send a blank. If you fill it in 
they'U process it and delete your name from 
mailing lists of all participating companies. 
Presumably this won't help with 
X-rated or stamp-coUecting lists, but it 
ought to keep you from getting semiannual 
gift catalogs from places like The House of 
Go-Go Creative, Inc. and those million 
solicitations from Consumer Reports and 
that File Box company . You call up the bank and ask your balance 
and they say, "I'm afraid I can't get that infor­
mation. You see, it's on a computer." 
(See Baaic Rejoinder, nearby.) 
Well, the reason it's this way is that 
they're handling things in Batch (see p-HS ) 
and they aren't storing your account on disk, 
or if they are they don't have a terminal they 
can query it with. 
But to say that they can't get the infor­
mation becauae it's on a computer is a typical 
use of the computer as an excuse (see Cyber-
crud, p. $ ); and second, if the person be­
lieves this to be an explanation, it's a sign of 
the intimidation and obfuscation that have been 
sown among the clerks who don't understand

Everybody blames the computer. 
People are encouraged to blame the 
computer. The employees of a firm, by 
telling outside people that it's the 
computer's fault, are encouraging public 
apathy through private deceit. The pre­
tense is that this thing, the computer, 
is rigid and inhuman (see "The Myth of 
the Computer," p. ? ) and makes all 
kinds of stupid mistakes. 
Computers rarely make mistakes. If 
the computing hardware makes a hardware 
error in a billion operations, it may 
be noticed and a repairman called. (Of 
course, once in a billion operations is 
once in a thousand seconds, or perhaps 
every ten minutes. That ought to be 
mentioned.) Anyhow, innocent gadgetry 
is not what forces you to make stupid 
multiple choices on bureaucratic forms; 
mere equipment isn't what loses your 
subscription records; 
By system we mean the whole setup: the 
computer, the accessories that have been 
chosen for it, its plan of operation or 
program, and the way files are kept and 
complaints handled. 
Don't blame the computer. 
Blame the system; blame the program­
mer; blame the procedures; best of all, 
blame the company. Let them know you 
will take your business to wherever they 
have human beings. Same for governmental 
agencies: write your congressman. And 
so on.

we should all practice and have ready at the 
tip of our tongues: 
WHY THE HELL NOT? YOU'RE THE ONES WITH 
THE COMPUTERS, NOT ME! 
Let's froth up a little citizen indignation here. 
In principle we no longer need account 
numbers. 
Now that text processing facilities are 
available in moBt (if not all) major computer 
languages, the only excuse for not using these 
features is the programmer's notion of his own 
convenience— not that of the outside customer 
or victim. 
Example. Someone I know got brand new

cards. He made no note of their numbers. Then 
he lost them both. Duly he reported the losses.

without the numbers. Not having used them, he 
had no bills to check. Even though he was the 
only person at that addresa with anything like

cause they were fibbing, or because they had

program for the purpose. (See Baaic Rejoinder, 
nearby.)

major life insurance companies. Don't lose the

Write the number down. 
AT "Cot* tortus" 
Pew of us can help feeling outrage at 
the book clubs, or subscription offices, or 
billing departments. that don't reply to our 
letters. Or reply inappropriately, with a form 
printout that doesn't match the problem. 
First let's understand how this happens. 
These outfits are based on using the com­
puter to handle all correspondence and trans­
actions. The "office" may not have any people 
in it at all-- that is, people whose job it is 
to understand and deal sensibly with the prob­
lems of customers. Instead, there may just be 
keypunch operators staffing a Batch System, set 
up by someone who has long since moved on. 
The point of a batch system (see p.f$") 
is to save money and bother by handling every­
thing in a controlled flow. This does not mean 
iri principle that things have to be rigid and 
restrictive, but it usually means it in practice. 
(See "The Punch Card Mentality," p. •) 
The system is set up with only a fixed number 
of event types, and so only those events are 
recognized as occurring. Most important, your 
problem is assumed to be one that will be 
straightened out in the course of the system's 
flow. While there may be provision for excep­
tions-- one clerk, perhaps— your problem has 
not seemed to him worthy of making an excep­
tion for. 
Here is my solution. It has worked 
several times, particularly on book clubs that 
ignored typed letters and kept billing me 
incorrectly. 
Get a roll of white shelf paper, two or 
three feet wide and twenty or more feet long. 
Write a letter on the shelf paper in magic 
marker. Make it big, perhaps six inches to a 
word. Legibility is necessary, but don't make 
it too easy to read. 
Explain the problem clearly. 
Now take your punch card— you did get 
one, didn't you, a bill or something?-- and 
mutilate it carefully. Tear it in quarters, or 
cut it into lace, or something. But make sure 
the serial number is still legible. Staple it 
lovingly to your nice big letter.. 
Now fold your letter, and find an envelope 
big enough for it to fit in, and send it, regis­
tered or certified mail, to ANY HUMAN BEING, 
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT, or whatever, and 
the company's address. 
This really works quite well. 
I am assuming here, now, that your prob­
lem has merit, and you have been denied the 
attention required to settle it. If we want justice 
we must ourselves be just. 
There is one further step, but, again, to 
be used only in proportion to the offense. This 
step is to be used only if a meritorious commun­
ication, like that already described, has not 
been properly responded to in a decent interval. 
We assume that this unjust firm has sent 
you a reply envelope or card on which they 
must pay postage. Now carefully drafting a 
follow-up letter, explain once again, in civil 
language, the original problem, your efforts 
at attention, and so on. Now put it in a package 
with a ten or twelve-pound rock, affix the 
reply envelope to the outside, and send it off. 
The problem, you see, has been to get 
out of the batch stream and be treated as an 
exception. Flagrantly destroying the punch card 
serves to remove you from the flow in that fash­
ion. (However, just tearing it a little bit prob­
ably won't: a card that is intact but torn can 
simply be put in a certain slot of the card-punch 
and duplicated. Destroy it good and plenty.) 
In all these cases remember: the problem 
is not that you are "being treated as a number," 
whatever that means, but that your case does 
not correctly fall in the categories that have 
been set up for it. By forcing attention to your 
case as an exception, you are making them 
realize that more categories are needed, or more 
people to handle exceptions. If more people do 
this when they have a just complaint, service 
will improve rapidly. The people who send it out like to call it 
personalized advertising and the like. But most 
of us call it Junk Mail. And its vagaries are 
NOT THE POOR COMPUTER'S FAULT. What gets 
people angry derives from the system built 
around the poor computer. 
You may wonder why you get more and 
more seed catalogs, or gift-house catalogs, as 
time goes on, even though you never order any­
thing from them. Or why a deceased member 
of the household goes on getting mail year 
in and year out, regardless of your angry post­
cards . 
How does it keep coming? 
Through the magic of something called the 
Mailing List. 
And especially the peculiar way that 
mailing lists are bought and sold. 
me rcBMwu. MDIUH 
Now, a mailing list is a series of names 
and addresses of possible customers. stored on 
computer tape or disk. 
You can buy the use of a mailing list. 
But you cannot buy the mailing list itself. 
Suppose you have a brochure advertising 
pumpkin-seed relish, which you suggest has 
rejuvenating powers. You want this brochure 
to go out to rich college graduates. 
You go to a mailing-list house. 
"I cannot sell you this mailing list out­
right," says the jolly proprietor, "for it is my 
business to sell its use again and again, so 
I do not want anybody else to have a copy of 
it." So you leave 2500 pumpkin-seed relish 
brochures with the mailing list company. and 
pay them a lot of money. And they swear on 
a stack of bibles that they have mailed the bro­
chures to their special list of rich college grad­
uates . 
Well, let's say you get 250 sales from 
that mailing. (10% is fantastically good.) But 
out of curiosity you go to another mailing-list 
house and have another mailing sent out-- this 
one to people who have low incomes and little 
education. 
This time you get lj>% orders. 
Now guess what you are acquiring. 
A mailing list of your very own. Of peo­
ple who eat pumpkin-seed relish. 
Mailing lists are, you see, generally ren­
ted blind, with no chance to see the addressees 
or check as to whether they've already been 
mailed to. 
And that explains all the duplications. 
If an advertiser is going after a certain 
type of customer, and goes to several mailing-
list houses asking for mailings to that particular 
type of customer, chances are some people will 
be on several of the lists. And since there's 
no way to intercompare the lists, these poor 
guys get several copies of the mailing. 
(Another way this can happen is if some 
cheapskate has his own mailing Hat and doesn't 
cheek it for repeats of the same name. But 
writing the computer program to check for 
repeats of the same name is not easy-- there 
might just be a Robert Jones and a Rob Jones 
at the same address-- and these things are not 
usually checked manually. They're big.) 
Another possibility exists for eliminating 
duplications when you rent mailing lists. You 
can bring in a magnetic tape with your mailing 
list on it, and they can send out the mailing 
only to the members of their list who are not 
already on your list. That way you still cant 
steal their list, since the tape is on their 
premises. The trouble is, they can steal your 
list, by making a copy of the tape. Oh dear. 

--- Page 72 ---

From all this, one last speculation creeps 
forward. 
Ivan Sutherland, in considering the struc­
ture of subroutining display processors, has . 
noted that as you get more and more sophisti­
cated in the design of a display program fol­
lower, you come full circle and make it a full-
fledged computer, with branch, test, and arith­
metic operations. 
If the somatic mechanism should turn out 
to have a program follower as described, it is 
not much of a step to suppose that it might have 
the traits of an actual computer, i.e., the ability 
to follow programs, branch, and perform manip­
ulations on data bearing on those operations. 
In other words, the digital computer may 
actually have been invented long before von 
Neumann, and we may have billions of them 
on our person B already. 
It may sound far-fetched, but the mechan­
isms elucidated at this level are so far-fetched 
already that this hardly seems ridiculous. 
THE COMPUTER FRONTIER 
Regardless of what's actually in the cell, 
it is clear that being able to adapt molecular 
chemistry, especially DNA and RNA, to computer 
storage is a beckoning computer frontier. 
This would make possible computer mem­
ories which are far larger and cheaper than 
any we now have. 
Basically we can separate this into two 
aspects: 
The DNA Readout. This part of the sys­
tem would create long molecules holding digital 
information. 
The DNA Readin. This would convert it 
back to electrical form again. 
Weird possibilities follow. One is that 
(if chemical memory is generic, rather than 
idiosyncratic to an individual's neural pathways) 
knowledge could be set up somehow in "learned" 
DNA form, whatever that might turn out to be, 
and injected or implanted rather than taught • 
Weird. 
As our ability to create clones improves, 
we could clone new creatures, or genetic "im­
provements"-- which, considering the racehorBe 
and the Pekinese, means "those sorts of non­
viable modifications supported in human society." 
And of course that ghastly stuff about building 
humanB, or semi-humans; having traits that 
somebody or some organization, ulp, thinks is 
desirable... 
But the real zinger is this one. It might 
juBt be a small accidental printout meant to 
test the facility, or maybe just a program bug— 
— but the system could output a virus 
that would destroy mankind.

It used to be fashionable to say, 
"The brain la a computer." 
But now people say, "The brain 
is a hologram." 
Fashion* change. Almost nothing is known about the brain. 
Oh, there are lots of picture-books showing 
cross-sections of brains... Maybe you thought 
it was just a big cauliflower, but it's full of 
strings and straps and lumps and hardly any­
thing is known about any of it. 
Clinical evidence, of course, tells us 
that if this or that part is cut out, the patient 
can't talk, or walk, or smell, or whatever. 
But that doesn't come close to telling us how the 
thing works when it does work. The histologists, 
the perceptual psychologists, the anatomistB, 
are all working at it— with no convergence. 
Beautiful example: the split-brain stuff, which 
1 just better not even bring up here (see new 
Maya Pines book, Harcourt Brace). 
We used to dissect brains when I worked 
down in Dr. Lilly1 B dolphin lab. Dolphin brains 
are about 1.2 times the size of ours, and Lilly 
quite reasonably pointed out that this might mean 
dolphins were smarter than us. 
And, of course, the bigger whales even 
smarter. We had a killer-whale brain in the 
deepfreeze that was about 2i feet across. And 
whales come much bigger than that; the Killer's 
maybe a quarter the length of the Blue. 
(I should point out here that Lilly's pub­
licity on the intelligence of dolphins was a little 
too good: it somehow didn't get mentioned that 
dolphins are just very small whales, the only 
ones you can feasibly keep in a lab. So think 
of whales as the possible super-smarties, not 
just dolphins.} 
What's that you say? That "brain size 
isn't what counts"? That's an interesting point. 
People with small heads are by and large 
just as smart as people with big heads. That's 
one argument. 
However, people have much bigger brains 
than almost any other animals. That indicates 
something too. 
I believe that the only other animals with 
very big brains are elephants and whales. (An 
anatomical explanation: the weight is supported 
on the man by balancing it, on the elephant by 
a heavy and comparatively inflexible neck offset 
by a grappling tool, and in the whale by putting 
it in the front of a torpedo. But most other 
anatomies couldn't manage a big brain, so they 
can't evolve one.^ 
Anyhow, so the scientific question is 
whether big-brained species are smart. Well, 
dogs are smarter than rats... 
But about these other guys in our league 
and beyond. How do we know soientifically 
that "the size of the brain isn't what counts"? 
Because obviously they're not as smart as we 
are, people say. Therefore it isn't brain size 
that counts. The depth of this logic should be 
evident. (I've even heard people say, "Of course 
they're not as smart. They don't have guns.") 
Pay close attention to an elephant sometime. 
Working elephants in India respond to some 
500 different oral commands. 
Can you think of a 501st thing to ask an 
elephant to do? (I rather suppose it could oblige.) 
Anyway, the dozen whales I've known per­
sonally were smart as heU. 
It used to be believed that memory was 
exclusively a matter of synaptic connections--
the gradual closing of little switches between 
nerve cells with practice. 
It is now known that temporary or 
short-term memory is synaptic, but something 
else takes place after that. It's believed that 
after a certain period, and it has something 
to do with rest and sleep, memories are trans-
ferred to some other form, presumably chemical. 
But how? 
My friend Andrew J. Singer has a beau­
tiful hypothesis that wraps it up. His guess 
is that memories are moved from synaptic 
storage to DNA (!) storage during dreaming, 
or more specifically REM sleep. I like that one. 61

"fee HiTicjrOHfom? 
The focus of attention in genetics and 
organic chemistry has for a decade now been 
the remarkable systems and structures of the 
molecules of life. DNA and RNA. 
DNA ia the baaic molecule of life, a long 
and tiny strand of encoded Information. Actually 
it is a digital memory, a stored representation 
of codes necessary to sustain, reproduce, and 
even duplicate the creature around it. 
It is literally and exactly a digital memory. 
Its symbols are not binary but quaternary, as 
each position contains one of four code molecules; 
however, as it takes three molecules in a row to 
make up one individual codon, or functioning 
symbol, the actual number of possible symbols 
is 64-- the number of possible combinations of 
four different symbols in a row of three. (I don't 
know the adjective for slxtyfourishness, and it's 
just as well.) 
The basic mechanism of the system was 
worked out by Francis Crick and James Watson, 
who understandably got the Nobel Prize for it. 
The problem was this: how could living cells 
transmit their overall plans to the cells they 
split into? and how could these plans be 
carried out by a mechanical process? 
The mechanism is astonishingly elegant. 
Basically there is one long molecule, the DNA 
molecule, which is really a long tape recording 
of all the information required to perpetuate 
the organism and reproduce it. This is a 
long helix (or corkscrew), as Linus Pauling 
had guessed years before. The chemical pro­
cesses permit the helix to be duplicated, to 
become two stitched-together corkscrews, and 
then for them to come apart, unwinding to go 
their separate ways to daughter ceLU. One theory about the mechanlca of this ia 
that a sort of zipper slide, called the ribosome. 
chugs down the tape, attaching the called-fbr~ 
amino aclda and peeling off the ever-longer result. 
As a tape recording, the molecule directs 
the creation of chemicals and other cells by an 
intricate series of processes, not well understood. 
Basically, though, the information on the basic 
DNA tape is transferred to a new tape, an active 
copy called "messenger RNA," which be­
comes an actual playback device for the 
creation of new molecules according to 
the plan stored on the original. 
Some things are known about this process 
and some aren't, and I may have this wrong, 
but basically the DNA-- and its converted copy, 
the RNA-- contain plans for making all the 
basic protein molecules of the body, and anything 
else that can be made with amino acids. (Those 
molecules of the body which are not proteins or 
built of amino acids are later made in chemical 
processes brought about by these kinds.) 
Now well may you ask how this long tape 
recording makes chemical molecules. The answer, 
so far as is known, is extremely puzzling. 
As already mentioned, the basic code 
molecules (or nitrogenous bases? are arranged 
in groups of three. When the RNA is turned 
on, these triples latch onto the molecules of 
amino acid that happen to be floating by in the 
soupy interior of the cell. (There are twenty--
seven amino acids, and sixty-four possible 
combinations of three bases; this is fine, because 
several different codons of three bases can glom 
onto the same passing amino acid.) 
Now, the tape recording it divided into 
separate sections or templates; and each template 
does its own thing. When a template is filled, 
the Btring of amino acids in that section separate, 
and the long chain that results is a particular 
molecule of significance "in some aspect of the 
critter's life processes— often a grand long 
thing that folds up_ in a certain way. exposing 
only certain active surfaces to the ongoing 
chemistry of the cell. Now, here are some of the funny things 
that are known about this. One is that there is 
a particular codon of three bases that is a stop 
code, just like a period in ordinary punctuation. 
This signals the end of a template. Another is 
that the templates on the tape are in no partic­
ular order, but distributed higgledy-piggledy. 
(Geneticists engaged in mapping the genes of a 
particular species of creature find that the gene 
for eye color may turn out to be right next to 
the gene for length of tail-- but where those 
are really, and what the particular molecules do 
that determine it, are still mysterious sorts of 
question.) 
Here is some more weird stuff about this. 
Large sections of the DNA strand are "dork," 
it turns out, just meaningless stretches of random 
combinations of bases that don't mean anything— 
or ever get used. This ties in, of course, with 
the notion that genetic change is random and 
blind: the general supposition is that genetic 
mutation takes place a base or two at a time, 
and then something else activates a chance com­
bination in a dry stretch that turns out to be 
useful, and this is somehow perfected through 
successive 1-base changes during the process 
of successive mutation and evolution. 
Amazing use is made of these mechanisms 
by some viruses. Now, viruses are often thought 
of as the most basic form of life, but actually 
they are usually dependent on some other form 
and hence more streamlined than elemental. Well, 
some viruses (but not all) have the capacity for 
inserting themselves in the genetic material: 
breezing up to the DNA or RNA, unhooking it in 
a certain place and lying down there, then being 
duplicated as part of th£ template, then unhooking 
themselves and toddling away-- both parent virus 
and copy. I can't for the life of me think of an 
analogy to this, but I keep visualizing it as hap­
pening somehow in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. 
CONTROL MECHANISMS 
Now. all cells are not alike. From the first 
beginning cell of the organism (the zygote), various 
splits create more and more specialized, differ­
entiated cells. A liver cell is extremely different 
from a brain cell, but they both date back by 
successive splitting from that first zygote. Yet 
they have different structures and manufacture 
different chemicals. 
One simplification may be possible: the 
"structure" of a cell may really be its chemical 
composition, since cell walls and other struc­
tures are thought to be special knittings of 
certain tricky molecules. Okay, so that may 
reduce (he question slightly. How then does 
the cell change from being an Original (undif­
ferentiated, zygotic) cell to the Specialized 
cella that manufacture particular other complex 
chemicals? 
One hypothesis was that these other cells 
have different plans In them, different tapes. 
But this theory was discarded when John Gurdon 
at Oxford produced a fresh frog zygote from the 
intestinal cell of a frog (which accordingly, in 
due time, became a frog de facto). This proved, 
most think, that the whole tape is in every cell. 
Thus there must be aomething-or-other 
that blocks the different templates at different 
times (You there, now you're a full-fledged epi­
thelial cell, never mind what you did before) 
and selects among all the subprograms on the tape. Much preBaing research in molecular bio­
logy, then, is concerned with searching for 
whatever it Is that switches different things on 
and off at different times in the careers of the 
ever-splitting cells of our bodies. Not to men­
tion those of all other living creatures, including 
turnips. 
COMPUTERISH CONJECTURES 
The guys who specialize in this are usually 
chemists, and presumably know what they're 
doing, so the following remarks are not intended 
as butting into chemistry. However, new per­
spectives often give fresh insight; and the matters 
we've covered BO far might seem to have a cer­
tain relevance. 
DNA and RNA, as already remarked, may 
without distortion be thought of as a tape. Indeed, 
on thia tape is a data structure, and indeed it is 
a data structure which seems to be involved with 
the execution of a program— the program that 
occurs as the organism's cells differentiate. 
There is evidently some sort of program 
follower which is capable of branching to dif­
ferent selections of (or subprograms) in the 
overall program, depending on various factors 
in the cell's environment-- or perhaps its age. 
Now, it is one thing to look for the par­
ticular chemical mechanisms that handle this. 
That's fine. On the other hand, we can also 
consider (from the top down) what sort of a 
program follower it must be to behave like this. 
(This is like the difference between tracing out 
particular circuitry and trying to figure out 
the structure of a program from how it behaves.) 
At any rate, the following interesting con­
jectures arise: 
1. The mechanism of somatic reproduction is 
a subroutining program follower— not unlike 
the second program follower of the subroutining 
display (see p. That is. it steps very 
slowly through a master program somewhere, 
and with each new step directs the blocking or 
unblocking of particular stretches of the tape. 
As the program is in each cell, presumably 
it is being separately followed in each cell. 
(This is sometimes called distributed computing.) 
2. In each cell, the master program is direc­
ting certain tests, whose results may or may not 
command program branching-- successive steps 
to new states of the overall program. It may 
be testing for particular chemical secretions in 
its environment; it could even be testing a counter. 
3. (This is the steep one.) If this were so, 
we might suppose that this program too was stored 
on the DNA, in one or more program areas; and 
it would therefore be necessary to postulate some 
addressing mechanism by which the program fol­
lower can find the templates to open and close. 
(And perhaps further sections of the program.) 
4. Indeed, it makes sense to suppose that 
such a program has the form of a dispatch table 
--a list of addresses In the tape, perhaps asso­
ciated with specifications of the tests which are 
to cause the branching.

nlsma and effects, considered from a co.p u ce run' s point of view— and lta chemical itructurt, or what Is

These wild speculations are offered in the 
spirit of interdisciplinary good fellowship and 
good clean fun. Whether (1) and (2) have any 
actual content, or are merely paraphrases of 
what is already known or disproven, I don't 
know; somebody may find the rest suggestive. 
Two more observations, though. These 
are not particularly deep, and may indeed be 
obvious, but they suggest an approach.

Because of the way census data is hand­
led, now, it is not possible to ask for the 
records of a specific individual. But this 
kind of capability leads to some real danger* 
There is a lot of information stored 
•bout most individuals in this country. 
Credit information, arrest records, medical 
and psychiatric files, drivers' licenses, 
military service records, and so on. 
Now, it is not hard to find out about 
an individual. A few phone calls from an 
official-sounding person can ascertain his 
credit rating, for instance. But that is 
very different from putting all these re­
cords together in one place. 
The potential for mischief lies in 
danger to individuals. Persons up to no 
good could carefully investigate someone 
through the computer and then burglarize 
or kidnap. Someone unscrupulous could 
look for rich widows with 30-year-old un­
married daughters. Organized crime could 
search for patsies and strong-arm victims. 
In the face of this sort of possi­
bility, computer people have been worry­
ing for years; noteworthy is the study 
by Alan Westin that originally sounded 
the alarm, and his too-reassuring follow-
up study of some data-gathering organ-
nations (see bibliography). But the 
scary data banks, the ones that evidently 
keep track of political dissenters, 
aren't talking about what they do (see 
Schwartz piece).

he is concerned about computers and the 
privacy problem. Cynics may joke about 
what his concern actually is; but a more 
credible stand was taken by vice-presi­
dent Ford at the 1974 National Computer 
Conference. Ford expressed personal 
concern over privacy, particularly consid­
ering a proposed system called FEDNET, 
which would supposedly centralize govern­
ment records of a broad variety. 
Not mentioned by Ford was the matter 
of NCIC, the National Crime Information 
Center. This will be a system, run by 
the FBI, to give police anywhere in the 
country access to centralized records. 
THE QUESTION IS WHAT GETS STORED. Ar­
rest records? Anonymous tips? (It would 
be possible to frame individuals rather 
nicely if a lot of loose stuff could be 
slipped into the file.) 
Many people seen to be concerned 
with preserving some "right to privacy," 
which is certainly a very nice idea, but 
it isn't in the Constitution; getting 
such a "right" formalized and agreed upon 
is going to be no small matter. 
But that isn't what bothers me. 
Considering recent events, and the char­
acter of certain elected officials whole 
devotion to, and conception of, democracy 
is lately in doubt, things' are scarcely 
as abstract as all that. Considering how 
helpful our government has been to brutal 
regimes abroad-- notably the Chile over­

(and which used sports arenas for deten­

Ii in Imposing lerm which means almost anything. 
Basically, "simulation" means any activity that 
represents or resembles something. Computer 
simulation is using the computer to mimic some­
thing real, or something thai might be, for any 
purpose: to understand an ongoing process better, 
or lo see how something might come oul in the 
Hero again, though, the Science myth steps 
In to mystify thia process, aa though the mere 
use of the computer conferred validity or some 
kind of truth. 
(On TV shows the Space Voyagers stand 
In front of the "computer" and ask In firm, unnat­
urally loud voices what will be the results of so-
and-so. The computer's oracular reply Is Infal­
lible. On TV.) 
Let there be no mystery about this. Any 
use of a data structure on a what-if basis is 
Simulation. You can simulate in detail or crudely; 
your simulation can embody any theories, sensible 
r stupid-, and your results may or may not cor-
1 to reality. 
A "computer prediction'' ia the outcome of 
a simulation thai someone, evidently. Is willing 
to stand behind. (See "computer election predic­
tions," p. 4iS~",) 
These point* have to be stressed because 
if there Is one computer activity which is preten­
tiously presented and stressed, it is simulation. 
Especially to naive clients. There is nothing 
wrong with simulation but there is nothing super­
natural about it either. 
Another term which n 
iam« la modelling. 
In the loose sense, simulation or model­
ling consists of calculations aboul any des-
crlbable phoenomens-- for Instance, optical 
equations. In optical modelling (and this ia how 
they design today's great lenses), a data struc­
ture is created which represents the curvature, 
mounting, etc. of the separate glasses in a lena. 
Then "simulating" the paths of Individual rays 
of light through that lens, the computer program 
test* that lena design for how well the rays 
come together, and so on. Then the design I* 
changed and tried again. 
Another type of simulation, an important 
and quite diatinct one-- Is thai which represent* 
the complex interplay of myriad units, finding 
out the upshots and consequences of intricate 
premise*. In traffic simulations, for Instance, 
II 1* easy enough to represent thousands of cars 
In a data structure, end hsvc them "reset" 
like drivers-- creating very convincing traffic 
Jams, again represented somehow within the 
Basically simulation requires two things; 
• representation, or data structure, that somehow 
represents the things you're simulating in the 
as pacts that concern you; and then a program 
does something to these data, that is In some 
way ilka the process you're concerned about 
acting on the thing* you're modelling. And each 
event of significance enacted by the program 
must somehow leave ita trace in the data structure. 
The line between simulation and other pro­
gramming Is not always clear. Thua the calcu­
lation of the future orbits of the planets could be 
called "simulations." • 
The most Intricate case*, though, don't 
particularly resemble any other kind* of program*. 
The intricate enactments of physical movement*, 
especially swarms and myriads with mixed and 
colliding populations, are especially Interesting. 
On a recent Scientific American article, simula­
tion helped to understand possible stream era 
of stars between galaxies as resulting from nor­
mal conalderatlon* or Inertia and gravitation. 
(Alar and Juri Toomre, "Violent Tides between 
Gsi*lies." Sd. Am. Dec 73, 18-48. )J 
Models of complex and changing rates are 
another interesting type. Enacting complex 
thing*, whose amounts are constantly changing 
In terms of percentage multipliers of each other, 
sound easy in principle, but their consequences 
can be quite surprising. (See "The Club of 
Rone." p. tf .) 
To Imagine th* kinds of mixed-case myriad 
modal* now possible, we could on today's big 
computers model snlirs societies, with s separate 
record describing each Idlvldual out of million*,

different preference* according to various theories 
-- then follow through whole societies' behavior

Any computer language can be used for 
some kind of simulation. For simulations invol­

However, they have another Important 
function, one which is going to be very Impor­
tant In education and, I hope, general public 
understanding, as computers get spread about 
more widely and become more usable. 
The availability of simulation modela can 
make things easier to understand. Well-set-up 
simulation programs, available easily through

I should point out here that for this pur­
pose-- Insightful Simulation— you don't always 
need a computer. I have in mind the so-called 
"simulation games." which If well designed give 
extraordinary Insights to the players. Allen 
Calhamer's brilliant game of Diplomacy, for in­
stance (Games Research, Boston; available from 
Brenlano's. NYC) teaches more about international 
politic* than you could suppose possible, t am 
also Intrigued by a game called "Slmsoc," worked 
out by a sociologist to demonstrate the develop­
ment of social structures from o state of random 
creation, but I haven't played it. (Clark C. 
Abt. or Abt Associates, Boston, has also done 
a lot of Interesting design here.) 
A last point, a very "practical" application. 
Simulation makes il possible (o enact things with­
out trying Ihem out In concrete reality. For in­
stance, in the lens-design systems mentioned 
earlier, the lenses don't have to be actually built 
to find out their detailed characteristic*. Nor 
la lt necessary to build electronic circuitry, now. 
to find out whether it will work-- at least that's 
what the sales men aay. You can simulate any 
circuit from a terminal, and "measure" what it 
does al any time or In any part with simulated 
meters. Similarly, when any computer la des­
igned now, It's simulated before It's built, and 
programs are run on Ihe simulated computer, 
aa enacted within a real computer, lo aee if it 
behaves as Intended. (Actually there are aome 
hot-wire types who insist on building thing* 
first, but one assume* that the more sensible 
computer designer* do this.) 
With automobiles it's harder; but CM, for 
instance, simulates the handling characteristics 
of lta cars betore they're ever built-- so that 
designers can redistribute weight, change steer­
ing characteristics and so on, till the handling 
char acts rl tat ics come out Ihe way the Consumers 
seem to like.

to determine the outcomes of all the unpredictable

Example. In 1973 the Saturday Review of

Effectively the game had been played thousands of 
times, the dice thrown perhaps millions, and 
the different "players" had employed various 
different strategies against each other In a varying 
mix: Always Buy, Buy Light Green, Utilities snd

Until now, the obscurity of computers 
has kept the public from understanding 
that anything like political issues were 
involved in their use. But now a lot of 
things are going to break. For instance--
rlHiTHer, FBI? 
J. Lds;ar Hoover's recent death 
raised a very serious problem. What 
about all those files he had been keep­
ing? Responsible critics of the FBI, 
such as Fred J. Cook, have claimed t.ut 
Hoover's policy basically consisted of 
chasing lone punks (like Dillinger, 
Bonnie and Clyde), harassing political 
dissenters, and keeping vast unnecessary 
records on innocent citizens-- thus vir­
tually creating the vast network of or­
ganized crime in America, which stays 
off the police blotters. Thus the ques-
of the FBI 
The question has been answered. In 
July 1973 Nixon appointed Clarence Kelley, 
police chief of Kansas City. After the 
previous goings-on-- for instance, Nixon's 
seeming to offer the post to Judge Byrne 
while he was presiding over the Ellsberg 
trial-- this looked to the press like a 
aid and uncontroversial resolution. 
But i itT 
Kelley certainly is aware of tech­
nology. It seems to be he that put dis­
play screens In Kansas City police cars, 
created the ALERT system (Automated Law 
Enforcement Response Team) and COPPS 
(Computerized Police Planning System], 
which for your amusement ties into MULES 
(Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System). 
(See Helvin F. Bockelman, "On-Line f>n~ 
puters Keeping Things Straight," which 
describes the Kansas City computer setup. 
Communications. June 73, 12-Z0.) In a 
more threatening vein, supposedly the 
Kansas City department kept computer 
files on "militants, mentals and acti­
vists." (Schwartr article, p. 19.) 
"hat Kelley does is thus of interest 
to us all. The big question is whether, 
for all his concern with police automation, 
he is also concerned with the freedoms 
this country used to be about.

The Department of Defense has a branch 
called AHPA, or Advanced Research and

kinds of technical developments with 
vaguely military possibilities. 
It is thus a supreae irony that ARPA 
paid for the development of: COMPUTER

more. Some folks might say that proves

f\^»oT«r (Vp»»-j Digital Equipment Corporation, in re •port mo 
to the "Energy Crisis" of 1973, didn't turn out 
their Christmas tree. Instead they hooked it up 
to a water wheel they happened to neve. Typical. 
DEC 
Tit FDPe^l* 
The computer companies are often referred 
to in the field as "Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs"-- a phrase that atays the same even aa 
the lesser ones (like RCA and General Electric) 
get out of the buslneaB one by one. The phrase 
suggest*, that they're all alike. To an extent; 
but there ia one company sufficiently different, 
and Important enough both In Its history and its 
continuing eminence, to require exposition here. 
This is Digital Equipment Corporation, usually 
pronounced "Deck," the people who first brought 
out the minicomputer and continue to make fine 
stuff for people who know what they are doing. 
Other computer companies have mimicked 
IBM. They have built big computers and iried 
lo sell them to big corporations for their business 
data processing, or big "scientific" machines and 
tried to sell them to scientists. 
DEC went about 11 differently, always de­
signing for the people who knew what they were 
doing*, and always going to great lengths to tell 
you exactly what their equipment did. 
First they made circuits for people who 
wanted to tie digital equipment together. Then, 
since they had the circuits anyway, they manu­
factured a computer (the PDP-1). Then more 
computers, increasing the line slowly, but always 
telling potential users aa much as they could 
possibly want to know. 
The aame for its manuals. People who 
wrote for information from Digital would often 
get. not s summary sheet referring you to a local 
sales office, but a complete manual (say. for 
the PDP-8), including chapters on programming, 
how to build interfaces to it, and the exact 
liming and distribution of the main internal pulses. 
The effect of thia was thai sophisticated users--
espectally in universities and research estab­
lishments-- started building their own. Their 
own interfaces, their own modifications to DEC 
computers, their own original systems around 
DEC computers. This policy ha* made for slow but steady 
growth, In effect, Digital built a national cus­
tomer base among the most sophisticated clients. 
The kids who as undergraduates and hangers-on 
built interfaces and kludgey arrangements, now 
aa project heads build big fancy systems around 
DEC equipment. The places that know computers 
usually have a variety of DEC equipment around, 
usually drastically modified. 
Because of the great success of its small 
computers, especially the PDP-8. even many com­
puter people think ihey only make small compu­
ters. In fact their big computer, the PDP-10, is 
one of the most successful Ume-shsring computers. 
An example ot its general esteem In the field: it 
is the host computer of ARPANET. the national 
computer network among scientific installations 
funded by the Department of Defense; basically 
this means ARPANET is a network of PDP-lOs. 
DEC's computers have always been designed 
by programmers, for programmers. This made 
for considerable suspense when the PDP-11 did 
not appear, even though the higher numbers did. 
and the grapevine had il that the 11 would be 
a sixteen-bit machine. It proved to be well 
waiting for (see p. 22.}, and has since become 
the standard sophisticated 16-bit machine in the 
industry. 
An area DEC has emphasized from the first 
haa been computer display (discussed al length 
on the flip side). Thus it is no surprise that 
their interactive animated computer display, the 
GT40 (see P-M|) is an outstanding design and 
success. (And" the University of Utah, currently 
Ihe mother church of computer display, runs its 
graphic systems from PDP-lOs.) 
In this plucky, homespun company, where 
even president Olsen is known by his first name 
(Ken), il is understandable thai marketing pizazz 
takes a back seat. This apparently was the view 
of a group of rebels, led by vice president Ed 
deCastro, who broke off in ihe late sixties to 
start a new computer company around a 16-bit 
computer design called the Nova— rumored lo 
have been a rejected design for ihe PDP-11. The 
company they started, Data General, has not been 
afraid to use the hard sell, anil between their 
hard sell and sound machine line they've seriously 
challenged the parent company. 
But Digital marches on. the Cor,(>ulor I'ur.'s 
computer company. If IBM Is computerdem's

have various drawbacks, DEC is Nikon, with u

through peripherals can you look at or hear 
results of what the computer does, store quan­
tities of information, print stuff out and 
whatnot. 
Trying to print lists of available stuff 
here is hopeless. There are thousands of 
peripherals fron hundreds of manufacturers. 
If you buy a mini, figure that your peripherals 
will cost I1S00 (Teletype) on un_. But mainten­
ance (see p. 5C ) is the biggest problen. If 
you buy peripherals from the manufacturer of 
the computer, at least you can be sure soncone 
will be willing to maintain the whole thing. 
(Independent peripheral manufacturers will 
often repair their own equipment, but nobody 
wants to be responsible for the interface.)

This is a psychological problem. 
A* a corporation they are used to designing 
systems that people have to use by fist, and must 
be trained to use. contributing to the captivity 
and inertia of the customer base. Thus the notion 
of making things deeply and conceptually straight­
forward, without special Jargon or training, may 
not be a concept the company is ready for. There is no way to escape IBM entirely. IBM 
mediates our contacts with government and medi­
cine, wilh libraries, bookkeeping systems, and 
bank balances. But these Intrusions are still lim­
ited, and moat of us don't have to live there. 
There are many computer people who refuse 
to have anything to do with IBM systems. Others, 
not so emphatic, will tell you pointedly that they 
prefer to stay as far away from IBM computers 
a* possible. If you ask why. they may tell you 
they don't care to be bothered with restrictive, 
unwieldy and unnecessary complications [the JCL 
language is usually mentioned). This Is one 
reason that quite a few people stick with minicom­
puters, or with firms using large computers of 
other brands. 
It is possible to work productively In the 
computer field and completely avoid having to 
work with IBM-style systems. Many people do. 
The famous Consent Decree of January 1956. (In a consent decree, 
an accused party admits no guilt but agrees to behave In 
certain ways thereafter.) In response to a federal anti-trust 
suit. IBM agreed to: 
sell as well as lease its computers, and repair those 
owned by others; 
permit attachments to lta leased computers. 
not require certain package deals; 
license various patents; 
not buy up used machines; 
and get out of the business of supplying computer 
services, i.e., programming and hourly rentals. 
Unbundling decision, late sixties. While this was not a government 
action but a an internal policy decision by the company, it some­
how had a public-relations appearance ol official compulsion. 
Beset by pressures from makers of look-alike machines, users of 
competitive equipment, and the threat of anti-trust action, IBM 
decided to change its policy and sell programs without computers 
and computers without programs. Delight amongst the Industry 
turned to chagrin as this became recognized as a price hike. 
The Telex Decision. September '73; Telex Corp. of Tulsa was awarded 
$352, 500.000 in triple damages (since reduced) for losses attributed 
to IBM's "predatory" pricing and other marketing practices. 
Much more important. IBM was required lo disclose the 
detailed electronics required to hook things to their computers and 
accessories within sixty days of announcing any. This was a great 
relief for the whole industry. Essentially it meant IBM could no 
longer dictate what you attach to their machines Unlortunately, 
it is not clear whether this will stand. 
But what we're waiting to hear about is whether tha Nixon Justice 
Department is, or is not, going to press the big anti-trust suit 
which has been long brewing, al the persistent request of other 
firms in the Industry,

IBM announced a number of worthy objectives when the 360 
line was announced in 1964. IBM should certainly be thanked for 
at least their lip service to these noble goals. 
1, 'One machine for all purposes, business and scientific.' 
(Thus the name'"360," for the "full circle" of applications.) 
By "business" this mainly meant decimal, at four bits a digit. 
Actually this meant grafting 4-bit decimal hardware to an other­
wise normal binary computer, and making both types of users share 
the same facility. 
2. 'Information storage and transmission will be stan­
dardized.' The 360 was set up to handle information 4 bits at 
a time, 8 bits at a time, 16, 32, and 64 bits at a time. (The 
preceding standard had been 6, 18 and 36 bits at a time.) 
In their 360 line, IBH also replaced the industry's stan­
dard ASCII code with a strange alphabetical code called EBCDIC 
("Extended Binary Coded Decimal Information Code"), ostensibly 
built up from the 4-bit decimal code (BCD), but believed by* 
cynics to have been created chiefly to make the 360 incompatible 
with other systems and terminals. 3. '360s will all look alike to the nrogran 
can be moved freely from machine to machine.' 
facilitate the moving of programs froi, aillBii Lumputers 
to big ones, a more important effect has perhaps been to make it 
hard to move from a bi£ computer to a smaller one. Note* tn~"T 
usefulness of this apparent paradox toTBM's m*IrTetinr. 
Between the trade press and dozens of acquaintances 
in the field, almost everything 1 hear about IBM and its 
products is negative (say five or ten to one)-- except from 
people who work or have relatives there. 
Perhaps it's Just sour grapes. Or the authority-
hating character or research typos. Or selective reading. 
Or perhaps there really is something sinister. 
The major questions are theae. 
1. How clean is their salesmanship? 
2. Are their systems unnecessarily difficult or 
cumbersome on purpose? 
3. How deep is their system of entrapment and 
forced commitment of the customer? How 
necessary are the de-standardizations and 
the constant changes? 
4. Do they have a final liberating vision? Do they 
really, after all, Intend to bring about a day 
when life is easier for people? When the 
difficulties of present-day computer systems, 
especially theirs, wither away? 1 think that 
history's Judgment on IBM in our time 
may narrow down to that simple question. 
(In this light it is not hard to understand 
IBM's stand on software copyrights vs. patents. 
IBM is against programs being patentable, which 
would cover abstracted properties, but argues 
in favor of copyright, whose protection Is 
probably more limited to the particulars of a 
given program. If they have their way. It would 
be assured that IBM could use any ingenious 
new programming tricks without compensation, 
whereas all unnecessary complications of bulky, 
cumbersome software would be covered In 
entirety by copyright.) 
Finally, tt has not been demonstrated that 
IBM has any general ability to make systems 
conceptually simple and easy to use. (Two 
good examples of hard systems are the Mag 
Tape S electric and Data text - easy for program­
mers, but hardly for secretaries.) There seems 
to be no emphasis on elegance or conceptual 
simplicity at IBM. Those who adopt such a 
philosophy (such as Kenneth Iverson) do so 
on their own. 
As mentioned earlier, this has something 
to do with the fact that individuals generally 
use IBM's Bystems because they have to, being 
employees or clients of the firms that rent IBM 
equipment, so there is no impetus to design 
programs or systems to run on simple or clear-
minded principles, or dress out intricate systems 
so they can be used easily. 
4. THE IMAGE. 
It is hard to analyze images, corporate or 
personal. They are often received in such differ­
ent ways by different populations. But there may be 
a commonality to the IBM image as generally seen. 
The image of IBM involves some kind of cold magic, 
a brooding sense of sterile efficiency. But other 
things are percolating In there. If we elide that 
connotation ol efficiency aside, the IBM image 
seems to have two other principal components, 
authoritarianism and complacency. It is this mix­
ture that longhalrs will naturally find revolting. 
This same combination, however, may be exactly 
what it is that appeals to buainess-management 
typas. 
IP YOU REALLY WANT IT. .. 
you can get character-by-character 
responding systems on IBM computers. 
The new Stock Exchange system uses s 
"Telecommunications Access Method" 
permitting non-IBM terminals to respond 
character-by-character. Just as systems 
for non-computer-people should. 
Trying to use this Input-output 
program on your local IBM computer Is 
another problem, though. Aside from 
program rental costs, there Is ths prob­
lem of its compatibility with Ihe whole 
line of IBM software. Adaptation* and 
reprogramming would probably be 
necessary up snd down the line j THE FUTURE 
What will IBM do next? 
Speculation ia almost futile, but necessary 
anyhow. The prospects are fascinating if not 
terrifying. 
No one can ever predict what IBM will do; but 
trying to predict IBM's actions-- IBM-watching is 
something like Kremlin-watching-- is everybody's 
hobby in the field. And Its consequences affect 
everybody. With so many things possible, and 
determined only in the vaguest way by technical 
considerations, the question of what IBM chooses 
to do next Is pretty scary. Because whatever 
they do we'll be stuck with. They can design our 
lives for the foreseeable future. 
We know that In the future IBM will announce 
new machines and systems, price changes (both up 
and down) in fascinating patterns, rearrangements 
of what they will "support," an3 changes in the 
contracts they olfer (see box. "IBM's Control"). 
Occasional high-publicity speeches by IBM high 
officers will continue to be watched with great care. 
But mainly we don't know. 
IBM's slick manufacturing capabilities mean 
that practically any machine they wanted to make, 
and put on a single chip, they could, and in a 
very short time. (The grapevine has it that the 
Components Division, which makes the computer 
parts, has bragged within the company that it 
doesn't really need the other divisions any more 
— it could just put whole computers on teeny 
chips if it wanted to.) 
In this time of the 370, things are for the 
moment stable. The 370 computer line is still their 
main marketing thrust. Having sold a lot of 370 
computers (basically sped-up 360s), their idea is 
at the moment to sell conversion Jobs to adapt the 
370 to run the new "Virtual System" control pro­
gram (VS or OS/VS or various other names) . This 
system (which is. incidentally, widely respected) 
makes core memory effectively much larger to 
programs that run on it. This effectively encour­
ages programmers to use tons of core, by means 
of virtual memory: essentially getting people in 
the habit of programming as if core were infinite. 
ThiB extension of apparent memory size distracts 
from any inefficiencies of both locally written pro­
grams and IBM programs, thus tending to increase 
use and rental charges. 
When that marketing impetus runs out we'll 
see the next thing. 
The other new IBM initiative is with smaller 
machines, the System 3 and System 7, being pushed 
for relatively small businesses. That is where they 
see another new market. How easy and useful their 
programs are in this area will be an important 
question. 
With the System 7, a 16-bit minicomputer 
for $17,000, IBM has at last genuinely entered the 
minicomputer market. (.Balancing its speed and 
cost against comparable machines, we can figure 
the IBM markup as being about 50%, which is 
typical.) 
In addition, it is rumored that IBM might 
put out a tiny business mini, to sell out of OPD. 
(Datamation. Dec 72. 139.) But really, who knows. 
In addition to this huge-memory strategy for 
its big machines, and the starting foray into spe­
cialized mini systems, there is the office strategy 
and "word processing." 
IBM has conceptually consolidated its 
various magic-typewriter and text services under 
the name ol "word processing," which means any 
handling of text that goes through their machines. 
This superficially unites their OPD efforts (type­
writers and dictation machines) with things going 
on in UPD, auch as Datatext, and allays inter-
divisional rivalries for awhile Also, by stress­
ing the unity of tha subject matter, il leaves the 
door open for later and more glamorous initiatives, 
such as hypertext systems (see "Carmody's System.1' 
flip side) . 
In other words, the foot Is in the door. Mr. 
Businessman has the ides thst automatic typing 
and things like that are IBM's special province. Even if it is true, as Anonymous says (see Bibliography) 
that IBM intimidates people and keeps its enemies 
from getting jobs at IBM-oriented establishments, 
that's not the end of the world. 
Grosch, Gould, Ilodgers and McGurk are alive and working. 
Extramural harassment like that employed by CM against 
Nader, for example, has not been reported. 
END OF THE'DINOSAURS? 
To a very great extent, IBM's computer 
market is based on big computers run in batch 
mode, under a very obtrusive operating system. 
Many people are beginning to notice, though, 
that many things are more sensibly done on small 
computers than on big ones, even in companies 
that have big computers. That way they can be 
done right away rather than having to wait in line. 
Is this the mammal that will eat the dinosaur eggs? 
On the other hand, a very unfortunate trend 
Is beginning to appear, an implicit feud within 
large organizations, which may benefit IBM's big 
computer approach. Those who advocate mini­
computers are being opposed by managers of the 
big computing installations, who see the minis 
as threatening their own power and budgets. This 
may for a long time hold the minis back, perhaps 
with the help and advice of computer salesmen who 
feel likewise threatened. But there will be no 
holding back the minis and their myriad offspring, 
the microprocessors (see p. ^ ). And the inroads 
should begin soon. 
(Others are growing to know and love true 
high-capacity time-sharing as a way of life, like 
that offered for DEC. GE and Honeywell machines. 
This. too. may begin to have derogatory effects on 
IBM's markets.) 
Finally, it must be noted that almost all big 
companies have computers, usually IBM computers, 
and so an era of marketing may well have ended. 
It may be possible for IBM to go on selling bigger 
and bigger computers to the customers who already 
have them, but obviously this growth can no 
longer be exponential.

An interesting example ot an IBM non-
breakthrough was the dramatic announcement in 
19B4 of the 380 computer, portrayed as a machine 
which would at last combine the functions of 
both "business" computers and "scientific" com­
puters. Bul other companies, such as Burroughs 
(with the 5500) had been doing this for some 
time. The quaint separation of powers between 
scientific computers (with all-binary storage of 
numbers) and business computers (decimal 
storage) was bssed only on tradition and mar­
keting considerstions. and was otherwise unde­
sirable. In amalgamating the "two types." IBM 
wss only rescinding their own previous un­
necessary distinction. The drama of the an­
nouncement derived in large measure from ths 
stress they had previously laid on the division. 
(Fortune ran an Interesting piece on the decision 
struggles preceding the introduction of the 3G0 
computer, and the internal arguments as to whe­
ther there should be one line of computers or two. 
See the flve-billlon-dollsr gamble piece. Biblio­
graphy.) 
This ties in closely with another interes­
ting aspect of the IBM image, the public notion 
that IBM is a great Innovator, bringing out 
novel technologies all the time. It is well known 
In the field that they are not: IBM usually does not 
bring out a new type of product until some other 
company has pioneered it. (Again remember 
the earlier point, that the product offering Is a 
strategic maneuver.) Bul of course such facts 
do not appear in the promotional literature, nor 
are they volunteered by the salesman. 
The expression for this in the field is 
that IBM "makes things respectable." That is, 
customers get that reassured feeling, when IBM 
adds other people's innovations to their product 
line, and decide it's okay to go ahead and rent 
or buy such a product. (This also sometimes 
kicks business bsck to the original manufacturer.) 
A few examples of things that were already 
on the market when IBM brought them out. often 
making them sound completely new: transistorized 
computers (first offered by Philco), virtual mem­
ory (Burroughs). microprogramming (introduced 
commercially by Bunker-Hamo). 
This is not to say that IBM is incapable of 
innovation; merely that they are never in a 
hurry about it. The introduction of IBM pro­
ducts is orchestrated like a military campaign, 
and what IBM brings out is always a carefully-
planned, profit-oriented step intended not to 
dislocate its product line. Thia is not to say 
that they don't have new stuff in the back room, 
a potential arsenal ol surprises of many types. 
But it is probable that most of them will never 
be seen. This is because of IBM's "impact" 
Unique in IBM's position is the problem of 
fitting new products Into the market alongside 
its old ones. Its problem is much worse, say, 
lhan lhat of Procter a Gamble. The problem is 
not merely its size and the diversity of its 
products, but the fact that they may interfere 
with each other ("impact" each other, they say) 
in very complicated ways. A program like 
their Datatext. for example, which allows cer­
tain kinds of text input and revision from ter­
minals, may affect its typewriter line. These 
are no small matters: the danger is that some 
new combination of products will save the cus­
tomers money IBM would otherwise be getting. 
Innovations must expand the amount IBM is 
taking In, or IBM loses by making them. 
These complications of the product line 
in a way provide a counterbalance to IBM's fear­
some power. The corporation has an Immense 
inertia based on its existing product line and 
customer base, and on ways of thinking which 
have been carefully promulgated and explained 
throughout its huge ranks, that cannot be 
revised quickly or flippantly. 
Nevertheless it Is remarkable how at 
every turn-- notably when people think IBM 
will be set back-- they manage to make policy 
declaiona or strategic moves which further con­
solidate their position. Often these seem to 
Involve restricting the way their computers will 
be used (see box, "IBM's Control.") 
(The most ironic such counter move by IBM 
occurred a few years ago with the so-called 
"unbundling" decision. IBM at last agreed (on 
complaint from other software firms] to stop 
giving Its programs away to people renting the 
hardware. Glee was widespread in the industry, 
which expected IBM to lower computer prices 
In proportion to what it would now charge for 
the software. Not st all. IBM lowered Its com­
puter prices by a minuscule amount and slapped 
heavy new price* on the software-- often 
charges of thousands of dollars per month.) 
A persistent r a lhat IBM tin 
all Its sale am en in a geographic 
area if a key or preeUge sale is 
"lost," as when M.I.T's Project 
MAC switched over to General Electric 
computers in the sixties, or when 
Western Electric Engineering Research 
Center passed over IBM computers 
to get a big PDP-10. 
Much aa some people would like 
to believe these stories, there seems 
to be no documentation. You would 
think one such victim would write 
an article about It if it were true. Finally, there 1* the popular doctrine of 
IBM's Infallibility. Thla. too. la a ways from 
the truth. The most conspicuous example was 
something called TSS/380. 
TSS/360 was B time-sharing system--
that Is, the control program to govern one 
model of the 3G0 as a time-sharing computer. 
According to Datamation ("IBM Phases Out Work 
on Showcssa TSS Effort," Sept. 1, 1971, 5B-9). 
over 400 people worked on lt at once for a total 
of some 2000 man-years of effort. And it was 
scrapped, a writeoff of some 100 million dollars 
In lost development costs. The system never 
worked wall enough. Reputedly users had to 
wait much too long for the computer's responses, 
and the system could not really compete with 
those offered elsewhere. 
The failure and abandonment of this pro­
gram is thus responsible for IBM's present non­
competitive position In time-sharing: customers 
are now assured by IBM that other things are 
more important. IBM-haters thank their stars 
that this happened. Cynics think it conceivable 
that high-power time-sharing was dropped by 
IBM in order to shoo Its customer base toward 
areas it controlled more completely. 
Two other conspicuous IBM catastrophes 
have been specific computers: the 360 model 90 
in the late sixties, and a machine called the 
STRETCH somewhat earlier. Both of these 
machines worked and were delivered lo cus­
tomers. (Indeed, Ihe STRETCH Is said by some 
to have been one of the best machines ever.) 
But they were discontinued by IBM as not suf­
ficiently profitsble. Therein Is said lo have 
been the "failure." (However, it has been al­
leged in court cases thai these were "knockout" 
machines designed to clobber the competition 
at a planned loss. ] 
B. Negative views of IBM systems. 
In the technical realm. IBM Is widely un­
loved because many people think some or all of 
their computers and programs are either poor, 
or far from what they should be. The reasons 
vary. 
Some of the people feeling this way are 
IBM customers, and for a lime they had an or­
ganized lobby, called SHARE (which also facil­
itated sharing of programs) . Recently, however, 
SHARE has become IBM-dominated, a sort of 
company union, according to my sources. 
The design of the 360, while widely ac­
cepted as a fact of life, is sharply criticized 
by many. (See "What's wrong with the 3607", 
IBM's programs, while they are available 
for a broad variety of purposes, are often notor­
iously cumbersome, awkward and inefficient, 
and sometimes dovetail very badly. However, 
the less efficient a program is. the more money 
they make from it. A program that has to be 
run for an hour generates twice as much revenue 
than if it did its work in thirty minutes: a pro­
gram that has to be run on a computer with, say, 
a million spaces of core memory generates len 
times the revenue it would in two hundred thou­
sand. 
The complex training and restrictions 
that go with IBM programs seem to have 
interesting functions. (See box. "IBM's Control.") 
C. Theories of IBM design. 
The question Is. how could a company 
like IBM create anything like the 360 (with Its 
severe deficiencies) and its operating system or 
control program OS (with its sprawling compli­
cations, not present in competitors' systems)? 
Three answers are widely proposed: On Purpose 
(the conspiracy theory), By Accident (the 
blunder theory), and That's How They're Set 
Up (the Management Science theory). These 
views are by no means mutually exclusive. 
The Management Science theory of IBM 
design is the only one of these we need take up. 
The extensive use of group discussion and 
committee decisions may tend to create awkward 
design compromises with a certain intrinsic 
aimlessness, rather than incisively distinct and 
simple structures. (See Gould's marvelous 
chapter, "The Meeting." 58-80.) 
Their use of immense teams to do big 
programming jobs, rather than highly motivated 
and especially talented groups, Is widely viewed 
aa counterproductive. For Instance, Barnet A. 
Wolff, in a letter to Datamation (Sept. 1, 1971, 
p. 13) says a particular program 
"remains ineffflcient, probably because of 
IBM's unfortunate habit of using trainees 
fresh out of school to write their 
systems code." 
There may also be something in the way that 
projects are Initiated and laid out from the top 
down, rather than acquiring direction from 
knowledgeable people at the technical level, 
that creates a tendency toward perfunctorlness 
and clunky structure. 
Thus there may very well be no intentional 
policy of unnecessary complication (see Box, 
"IBM's Control"). Bul the way In which goal* 
are set and technical decisions delegated may 
generate this unnecessary complication. Of i*>}\ 
IBM appeared In 1911 as the con­
solidation of a number of small companies 
making light equipment, under the name 
C-T-R Company (Computer-Tabulating-
Record). This was prophetic, consid­
ering how aptly it described the com­
pany's future business, and especially 
prophetic considering that today's 
stored-program computer was undreamed 
of at that time. 
According to William Rodgers' 
definitive company biography Think, 
the company'a creator was a shrewd 
operator named Charles R. Flint, 
dashing entrepreneur and former gun 
runner to the South American republics, 
who in his shrewdness brought in to 
run the company an Incredibly talented, 
fire-breathing and self-righteous indi­
vidual named Thomas J. Watson, even 
though Watson at that time was under 
prison sentence for his sales practices 
at another well-known company . The 
sentence was never served, and Watson 
went on to preside for many years 
over a corporation to which he gave 
his unique stamp. 
Watson arises from the pages of 
Think as a sanctimonious tyrant, 
hard as nails yet reverently principled 
in his words: the pillar of fervid, 
aggressive corporate piety. 
IBM was totally Watson's 
creation. The company became what 
he admired in others, a mechanism 
totally obedient to his will and imple­
menting his forceful and inspiringly 
rationalized convictions with alacrity. 
As the Church is said to be the bride 
of Christ, IBM might be characterized 
as the Bride of Watson, molded to the 
styles of demandingness. pressure, 
efficiency and pietism which so char­
acterized that man. But the ideas 
flowed from Watson alone, except for 
a few confidantes who received his 
nod. The company is vastly bigger 
now, and slightly more colorful, in a 
muted sort of way; but it is still the 
stiff and deadly earnest battalion of 
his dream. 
Because of Watson's background 
as salesman, he made Sales the apex 
of the corporation. The salesmen had 
the most prestige within the company 
and could make the most money; below 
that was administration, below that, 
technical stall. 
Watson eliminated the meat-slicing 
machines, and pushed the product line 
based on punched cards developed by 
IBM's first chief engineer, Herman 
Hollerith. According to Rodgers. it 
was impetus from the Depression, and 
the new bookkeeping requirements of 
Roosevelt's remedies, that skyrocketed 
the firm uniquely during the depths of 
general economic catastrophe, till 
Watson came to draw the highest salary 
of any man in the nation. In 1934 his 
Income was $364,432 (Will Rogers, not 
the author of Think, was second with 
•324.314) . Watson had neatly arranged 
to gel 5% of IBM's net profit. While IBM participated in the 
creation of certain early computers, it 
is Interesting that Watson dismissed 
Eckert and Mauchly when they came 
around after World War II tring to get 
backing for their ENIAC design, in 
certain ways the first true electronic 
computer. Eckert snd Mauchly went 
to Remington Rand, and the reaulting 
Univac was the first commercial 
computer. 
However, IBM bounced back 
vary well If there was one thing they 
knew how to do it was sell, and when 
they brought out their computers It 
was practically clear sailing. (The 
Univac I was the first of many compu­
ters to be delayed and boggled in the 
completion of its software, and this 
considerable setback helped IBM get 
the lead very quickly; they have 
never lost It since.) 
In the early sixties the IBM 7090 
and 7094 were virtually unchallenged 
as the leading scientific computers of 
the country. But IBM in the late six­
ties almost relinquished tha fields of 
very big computers and time-sharing 
to other companies, and their compu­
ters are not regarded as innovative. 
Nevertheless, IBM's Systems 3B0 and 
370, despite various criticisms, have 
been very successful; thousands of 
them are in operation around the globe, 
far more than all their rivals' big 
computers all put together. This des­
pite the fact that some of these systems 
have failed, including the big Model 91 
(an economic failure) and the TSS/360 
time-sharing program, a technical 
catastrophe. 
They have from time to time 
been accused of unfair tactics, and 
various antitrust and other actions 
(see "Legal Milestones" box) have 
required IBM to change us arrange­
ments in various ways. One decree 
required them to sell the computers 
that before they had only rented: 
.mother decision, lo. "unbundle," or 
bull computers separately from their 
programs (previously "given" away 
with the computers they ran on), Is 
widely believed to have prevented 
government action on the same 
matter. Showing characteristic 
finesse. IBM thereupon lowered the 
computer prices almost imperceptibly, 
then slapped heavy price-tags on 
the programs that had previously 
been free. 
Recent moves by the government 
have suggested an especially serious 
and far-reaching anti-trust suit against 
IBM. possibly one that might break the 
company up, with its separate divisions 
going various ways. However, In 
today's climate of cozy relations be­
tween business and government. It is 
hard to imagine that such matters 
would not be settled to IBM's liking. 
This lends a curious tint lo a remark 
one IBM person has made to the author, 
to wit, that maybe IBM wants to be 
broken up. That might be one way of 
reducing the unwieldiness and lnter-
dependency of its product line; In 
addition to reducing its vast, under­
utilized personnel base. (Another 
angle: Acting Attorney General Bark 
has expressed the view that IBM Is 
big only because its products and 
management are wonderful, so the 
antitrust case may simply evaporate 
during the rump days of the Nixon 
incumbency.)

PROVINCIAL? 
There would **«n to ba no question that 
IBM people are comparatively conservative and 
conventional. This partly because that's who IBM 
hires (though thay reportedly urge tolerance of 
Ihe unusual employee in a training film. "The Wild 
Duck"). A huge number of IBM people never 
worked for anybody else: obviously this affects 
the perspective, like slaying at one university 
all your life, or in one city. 
It may also be that because IBM places sjch 
a premium on dependability and obedience, new 
Idea* (and the abilities needed to generate them) 
naturally run Into a little trouble. Some critics 
find among IBM people a heavy concern with con­
ventional symbols of achievement, and (unfor­
tunately) seeing the world stuck sit over with 
conventional labels and Middle American stereo­
type* 
Some of the most amusing material on thla 
comes from an odd source s writer named 
Hey wood Gould who, si] unprepared, became a 
consultant to IBM. earned unconscionable amounts 
of money (HO.ODD In six months), and lived to 
write a very funny and observant book about it 
(see Bibliography) , 
But it is neceaaary on these matters to aee 
how difficult things can be for IBM people, To be 
Identified as an IBM person Is something like wear­
ing a ring in your nose, a yarmulka or a halo: 
an entrapment in a social role thst makes the Indi­
vidual's position awkward among outsiders. IBM 
people often have to take guff at parlies, unless 
they are IBM parties, DeFenslveness may account 
for soma of the Overdo, and some of the clannlsh-
B RA1 NtfASHED? 
It Is true thai IBM people are essentially in 
tholr own world. One theorv Is that comparl-
mentallzation within the firm (rather visible in 
their designs) may tend to stifle. Indeed, because 
IBM people can expect to be briefed and schooled 
In every technical matter they will need lo know 
for a given assignment, the Incentive to follow 
technical developments through outside magazines 
and societies may be reduced. Between Think 
magazine and corporate briefings, it is possible 
for IBM people to be comparatively (or even com­
pletely) unaware of innovations elsewhere In the 
field, except aa theae new developments are 
presented to them within the organization. In 
this light It is easy to understand the Ibmers' 
sense of certainty that their firm invented every­
thing and is at the forefront. 
Of course many fine research efforts do go on 
there, in considerable awareness of what's hap­
pening elsewhere. Particular individuals at IBM 
have done excellent research on everything from 
computer hidden-line Imaging to the structure of 
the genetic code and computer-synthesized holo­
grams. APL itself (see pp.Zt.-3i. as developed 
by Iverson at Harvard and later programmed by 
him at IBM, is another example of sophisticated 
individual creativity there. So it's entirely 
possible. But IBM certainly has no monopoly on 
understanding or creativity, and IBM-haters 
sometimes talk as if the reverse is true. 1 book will help 
people who are Inconvenienced by 
systems to understand and plnpoln 
they think is wrong with the aysti 
their data structure, Interactive properties, 
or other design featurea-- and that they 
will try to express their discontents intel­
ligently and constructively to those res­
ponsible. Including, where appropriate.

2. SALES TECHNIQUES. W 
It is IBM's alleged misbehavior in pursuit 
of sales that has drawn some of the strongest 
criticism within the Industry, as well as consid­
erable litigation. Their "predatory pricing" 
(a lerm used by the judge in the recent Telex 
decision), and other mean practices, are (whe­
ther true or false) folklore within the Industry. 
These accusations are well summarized 
by "Anonymous" in a recent article (see Biblio­
graphy) . Basically the accusauons against 
IBM's sales practices are thai they play dirty: 
If you. say. the computer manager in a business 
firm, want to buy equipment from another out­
fit. IBM (so the story goes) will go over your 
head to your boss, accuse you of Incompetence, 
try to get you fired if you appose them, and 
Heaven knows what else. Anonymous claims 
that various forms of threat, Intimidation, "hard­
sell scare tactics" and "behind-the-scenes man­
ipulation" are actually standard practice in IBM 
sales, he or she alleges various instances in 
certain municipalities. 
Such behavior is emphatically denied, 
though not in relation to lhat article, by Board 
Chairman Gary. In a recent letter to Newsweek 
(see Bibliography). Cary emphasizes the Impor­
tance of IBM's 76-page Business Conduct Guide­
lines. Whether these are publicly examinable 
is nut stated. 
These charges were also taken up con­
cretely in a recent survey ol computing managers 
done by Datamation (summarized by McLaughlin 
in "Monopoly Is Not a Game:" see Bibliography). 
In Datamation's analysis of this survey, the 
managers did not seem to agree with these 
charges against IBM. However, it must be 
noted-- and this seriously calls into question 
the entire survey as analyzed-- that out of 1100 
panelists to the questionnaire. Datamation only 
considered 3B9 responses "usable," partly (It Is 
stated) because many did not give data allowing 
themselves to be identified. Considering the 
widespread fear ol IBM in the field, this may 
have strongly biased the poll in favor of IBM. "When we went from IBM to 
National Cash Register, it was like 
the difference between night snd day."

(Incidentally, it is amusing to note that 
even In this remaining company. In terms of 
"performance per dollar," the managers surveyed 
(and surviving the weedout) ranked the top 
three companies as DEC, Burroughs and Control 
Data. IBM waa worst oul of B. Obviously 
service counts for a lot.) 
An InteresUng view on IBM's sales ethica 
was expressed recently by Ryal R. Poppa, 
prealdent of Pertec Corp. 
"In the past, when there have been sale* 
situations where 'you can't honor the 
policy and win the deal,' IBM has violated 
the policy with the practice, he said." 
However, he believes that situation Is changing 
under IBM's new management, so that the guide­
lines will be observed in the future. ("Poppa 
Sees Several IBM Changes." Compulerworld. 
21 Nov 73, 29.) 
The peopls who take these matters of IBM 
sales practices most seriously-- IBM's competi­
tors-- now have their own organization, the 
Computer Industry Association. This is an asso­
ciation of computer companies, which has aa 
i intention the "establishment and preser 
of a sound and viable U .S. computer industry. 
based on... free and open competition." Empha­
sis theirs. Translation: they're out to get IBM,

Data Systems, has blood in his eye. Member­

3. TECHNICAL DECISIONS AND DESIGNS 
A. Prologue. 
Part of the myth of IBM's corporate perfec­
tion is based on the notion that technical matters 
somehow predominate in IBM's decisions, and 
that IBM's product offerings and designs thus 
emerge naturally and necessarily and inevitably 
irom theae considerations. This is rather far 
from the truth, 
IBM presents many of their actions as tech­
nical, even as technical breakthroughs, when 
in fact they are strategic maneuvers. The an­
nouncement of a new computer, for example, 
such as Ihe 3B0 or 370. Is usually made to 
sound as if they have invented something special, 
while in fact they have simply made certain 
decisions as to "which way they intend to go" 
and how they plan to market things in the next 
few years. 
THc VIRTUAL KtCHAU'CS 
IBM controls the industry principally by 
controlling Its customers. Through various 
mechanisms. It seems to enforce the principle 
that "Once an IBM customer, always an IBM 
customer," With sn extraordinary degree of 
control, surely possessed In no other field by 
any other organization in the free world, it 
dictate* what Its customers may buy, and what 
they may do with what they get. More than 
this: the exactions of loyalty levied upon IBM's 
customers are similar, in kind and degree, to 
what it demand* of Its own employees. IBM 
make* the customer's employees more snd more 
like its own employees, committing them as 
individuals, and effectively committing the com­
pany that buys from it. to IBM service in 
perpetuity. 
Here are some of the wsy* Ihls system of 
control seems to work. We are not saying here 
that this is necessarily how IBM plans it. 
rather, these are the virtual mechanics, virtual 
In the old sense, this is how it might as well 
b* working. In th* anthropological sense thl* 
Is • "functional" analysis, showing the tie-ins 
rather than the actual detailed thought processes 
that occur. And even if these are really the 
mechanics, perhaps IBM doesn't mesn them to be. 
It might Just somehow be a continuous accident. 
InterconnacUon and c npaUblllUei 
IBM acta as if it does not want competitor* 
to be abla to connect their accessories to its 
computer* It's as though GM could design th* 
roads so as to prevent the passage of other 
vehicles than il* own. 
This 1* done several way*. First. IBM 
has sometimes used contractual technique* to 
prevent such interconnection* lo It* syatem*. 
either lor bidding other thing* to be attached 
(or si least slapping on axira service charge* 
if thay arsl. or declaring that It would not 
be responsible for ovsrsll performance of such 
• eelur;. allacUvely withdrawing Ihe hardware 
iuarante* that la such s strong selling point. 
secondly. IBM does not tail all lhal need* 
to t*j known In order to make these intsrcon-
i* details of the hardwsr* Interfaces 
Finally. IBM can simply decree, perhaps 
claiming technical •*c***lty, that InterconnacUon 
la lmpo**lule. For Instance, IBM said for a 
lima that Ihalr latest big program. "VS," 01 
Virtual System, wouldn't work (U-snsiauon 
would not be allowed) U compeUUv* memories Now, there are many manufacturers who 
think this is very wrong of IBM: who believe 
they should have the right to sell accessories 
and parts-- especially core and disk memorles--
to plug onto IBM's computers. II has been 
generally possible for these other manufacturers 
to work these interconnections out awhile after 
the computer comes out on the market, but 
it's getting mare difficult. 
Thus the Telex Decision of September 17. 
1973. in which it was decreed by the judge lhat 
IBM would have to supply complete interface 
Information promptly when introducing a new 
computer, was a source of great jubilation in 
the computer field. However, lhal part of the 
judgment has since been cancelled. 
Much the same problem exists In the soft­
ware area. IBM Is less than interested in 
helping its competitors write programs that hook 
up to IBM program*, so the details of program 
hookup are not always made clear. Here, too, 
many smaller companies Insist they should be 
made to do it. 
B. Control and guidance of what the customer 
can gat. 
To a remarkable degree. If you are an 
IBM customer, you pracucally have to buy what 
they tell you. This IBM manages by an intri­
cate system of fluctuating degrees of sales and 
support and contractual dealing. The IBM cus­
tomer always has several opUons: but these are 
like forced cards, IBM la always introducing 
and discontinuing products, and changing prices 
•nd contractual arrangement* snd software op­
Uons in an elaborate choreography, which applies 
calculated pressures on Ihe customer. IBM has 
a flnely-luned syatem of customer Incentives by 
which it controls product phasing, to use the 
polite term, or planned obsolescence, as some 
people call it,

Program*, especially, are available with 
different degress of approval from IBM Ths 
technique of "support" Is ths concrete manlfea-
tation of approval. A support* d program Is 
one which IBM promises lo II* when bugs turn

matter of exquisite degree. It's not so much 
that you can or can't get a particular thing, 
but that the pricing and available contracts at 
a given time exert strong pressure to put you 
where they have chosen within their currently 
featured product line Moreover, extremely 
strong hints are always available; the salesman 
will tell you what model of their computers Is 
likely to be a dead end, or. on the other hand, 
what model is likely to offer various options 
and progressive developments in the near future. 
Some things are half-available, either as 
"RPQs" Ian IBM term for special orders-
Request Price Quotation), or available to 
sophisticated customers at IBM's discretion. 
With all the degrees of availability, It is 
easy for IBM to open or close by degrees

Also, different size* of computer will or

What It boils down to la that you. the 
customer, have few genuine options, especially

brings out a new computer, the prices and

does not always work. When the 370 was Intro­

It is as though they fostered a continual turnover 
of unnecessary complications to keep a captive

"IBM." as everyone knows, is the trade 
nark of the International Business Machines 
Corporation, an Immense company centered in 
Armonk. N.Y., but extending to over a hundred 
countries and employing well over a quarter of 
• million people. 
To many people. IBM is synonymous with 
computers. Some of the public, indeed, believes 
them to be the only computer manufacturer. 
B and lllm. there is Kodak. In 
automobiles, there is General Motors. And in 
the computer Held there is IBM. 
IBM sells some 6S to 701 of all tha com­
puters and programs thai are sold. In this res­
pect, the balanced near-monopoly, they are like 
Kodak and GM. 
But there are important differences. Ev-
everybody knows what a camera la. or an auto­
mobile. But to many, II not most, people, a 
computer is what IBM says it is. 
Ths Importance of this firm, for good or 
111, cannot be overstated: whose legend Is so 
thick, whose slock prices have doubled and re­
doubled, ten umea over, to its mulubillion-dollar 
mass: whose seeming Infallibility-- at least, as 
seen by outsider*-- have been the stuff ol 
legend, whose style ha* proliferated across the 
world. • style which has in a way itself become 
synonymous with "computers," whose name sym­
bolizes for many people-- remarkably, both 
those who love it and those who hate it— the 
New Age, 
The rigidity associated in the public mind 
with "tha computer" may be related in some 
deep way to this organization. As a corporation 
they are used to designing systems that people 
have to use in their )ob* by fiat, »nd thus there 
are few external limitations on the complications 
to our live* that IBM can create. 
Many people mistake IBM for ")u*t another 
big company," and here lies the danger. IBM's 
postuon in tha world is so extraordinary, so 
carefully poised (as a result of various anti­
trust proceedings and precautions) just outside 
of total monopoly of a vitally important and all-
penetrating field, that much of what thsy do haa 
implications lor all ol u*. Ralph Nader'* con­
tention that General Motor* l* too powerful to 
function as an Independent government surely 
applies even more to IBM. General Motors Is not 
in s poaluon to persuade th* public that every 
car has to have tan wheels and a snowplow.

tars in its c 
world that t 
But IBM la deeply sensluvs, in it* way, 
lo public relations, and has woven sn axtsnslve 
aystaa ol political Uas and 1 agenda (if not 
mythology) which hav* kept it almost completely 
exempt from the critical attention of concarn.d 
ctuzena, 
Thus It if necessary her*, simply as a 
matter of covering the field at an Introductory 
level, to rale* aome que*lion* and criticism* 
that occur to people who are concerned about 
IBM IBM presumably wilt not mind having 
these matters raised. th*ir public-spirited con­
cern in so many ar*** assures that wh*n some­
thing so publicly important •• the character ot 
their own power Is concerned, occasional 
scrutiny should be welcome It Is important to note first of all lhat IBM 
is In many respects the very model of a gener­
ous and dutiful corporate citizen. In "commun­
ity relations," in donations to colleges and uni­
versities, In generous release of the time of Its 
employees for charitable and civic undertaking*, 
it It almost certainly the most public-spirited 
corporation In America, and perhaps on Ihe 
face of the earth. 
They have been generous about many 
public interest project*, from Braille transcrip­
tion to donating photographers and facilities Tor 
films on child development. 
The corporation sponsors worthwhile cul­
tural events. "Don Quixote" with Rex Harrison 
on TV was terrific. Katherlne Hepburn's "Glass 
Menagerie" was marvelous. 
IBM's enlightenment and benevolence 
toward its employees la perhaps beyond that of 
any company anywhere They have rigorously 
upgraded the position of women and other minor­
ity employees; the opportunities for women may 
be greater there than anywhere else. They have 
upgraded repair of their systems, at any level, 
to white-collar status, and tool kits are disguised 
as briefcases. This innovation, making a repair­
man Into a "field engineer," Is one of the clever­
est public-relations and employment policies ever 
instituted. 
They are opanhanded to employees who 
want to run (or office, evidently regardless of 
platform. In the sixties there were peace candi­
dates who worked for IBM. and evidently got 
time off for it. More recently, Fran Youngsteln. 
an IBM marketing instructor, was a 1973 candi­
date for Mayor of New York on the ticket of the 
Free Libertarian Party, opposing all laws against 
victimless crimes (e.g. prostitution and odd sex), 
as well as Day Care and welfare. 
They also rarely fire people. Once you're 
in. and within certain broad outlines, it's ex­
tremely safe employment. For those who turn 
out not to fit in well, they have a tradition of 
certain gentle pressure-practices like moving 
you around the country repeatedly at IBM ex­
pense. This encourages leaving, but also ex­
poses the less-wanted employee to a variety of 
opportunities he might not otherwise see. without 
the trauma and anxiety of dismissal. 
(It is said that there are IBM firings, but 
they are rare and formidable. Hey wood Gould's 
description of an IBM firing (Corporation Freak,

thenticity, ia nevertheless bloodcurdling.) 
IBM's international manners (in its 115 
countries) are likewise praiseworthy. Compared 
to the perfidious behavior of some of our other 
multinational corporations, they are sweetness 
and light and highschool civics. Sensitive to 
the feelings of people abroad, they are said to 
operate carefully within arrangements made to 
satisfy each country. They train nationals for 
real corporate responsibility rather than bringing 
in only outside people. And they are sensitive 
to issues: for instance, they recently refused lo 
set up an Apartheid computer in South Africa. 
ONE THING IS PERFECTLY CLEAR: 
IBM has no monopoly on understanding or sophistication. 
Among computer people, feelings toward 
IBM range from worship to furious hate (depen­
ding only in part on whether you work there). 
Many, many are of course employed by 
IBM. and the devotion with which they embrace 
the corporation and Us spirit is a wonder of the 
But the spiritual community of IBM extends 
further. Upper-management types, especially 
Chairmen of Boards and comptrollers, seem to 
have a reverence for IBM that is not of this 
world, some amalgamated vision which entwines 
images of eternal stock and dividend growth 
with an idealized notion of management efficiency. 
Many others use and live with IBM's equipment, 
and view IBM as anything from "the greatest 
company in the world" to "a fact of life" or even 
"a necessary evil." In some places whole colo­
nies of users mold themselves in its image, so 
that around IBM computers there are many "Utile 
IBMs." full of people who imitate the personali­
ties and style of IBM people. (RCA. before lis 
computer operation fell to pieces. Imitated not 
Just the design of IBM's 360 computer, but a 
whole range of titles and departmental names 
from out of IBM. The sincerest form of flattery.) 
But outside this pale-- beyond the spiri­
tual community of IBM-- there are quite a few 
other computer people. Some simply ignore IBM. 
being concerned with their own stuff. Some 
like IBM but happen lo be elsewhere. Others 
dislike or hate IBM for a variety of reasons, 
business and social. And this smoldering 
hatred Is surely far different In character from 
anybody's atutud* toward Kodak or GM.

grams for a variety ol purposes. 
A company or governmental agency 
can get immense amounts of "help" 
and "information" from IBM. which 
offers free courses, even IBM 
people on "released time" to look 
over the problems on the premises. 
IBM offers various kinds of com­
patibility among its systems. 
IBM equipment Is rugged and 
durable, and their repairmen 
or "field engineers" struggle 
with great diligence and alacrity 
to keep it running Now for the bad news.. 
These programs are not necessarily 
sat up the way you would want them. 
(But If you take the trouble to adapt 
to them, you'll probably never get 
back.) 
The programs favor card or 
card-like input and. to date, strongly 
discourage time-sharing and widespread 
convenient terminal use by untrained 
people. 
IBM programs are also notoriously 
inefficient. (That way you have to use 
bigger machines for longer .) 
The courses indoctrinate with the IBM 
outlook, and the planted people spread 
II. Moreover, both mechanisms help 
IBM spot the people they can work wilh 
to make a big sale-- and (lt is alleged 
by some) those who stand in the way. 
It always seems to cost extra. 
1. SOCIAL ASPECTS OF IBM. 
It Is perhaps in the social realm. Including 
its Ideological character, that a lot of people 
are turned off by IBM. 
IBM has traditionally been the paternalistic 
corporation. [Paternalistic corporations were 
some kind of big philosophical issue to people 
In the fifties, but nobody cares anymore. Anyway, 
the rest were perhaps inconsequential compared 
to IBM.) Big IBM towns not only have a Country 
Club (no booze) , but a Homestead far the comfort 
of important corporate guests. There are dress 
codes (although non-white shirts and below-the-
collar hair are now allowed) , and yes. codes 
of private behavior (now subdued) . These irritate 
people with libertarian concerns. They do not 
bother employees, evidently, because employees 
knew what they were getting into. 
Generalizations about IBM people obviously 
cannot be very strong . Obviously there is going 
to be immense variation among 265,000 people, 
half of whom have college degrees; but of course 
one of the great truths of sociology is that any 
non-random group haa tendencies. 
More lhan that In this case. In a way IBM 
people are an ethnic group. Impressive indeed 
are the general energy and singlemindednesi 
of the people, galvanized by their certainty that 
IBM is true, good and right, and that the IBM 
way is the way. This righteousness is of course 
a big turn-off for a lot of people. Perhaps It 
leads in turn to the most-heard slurs about IBM 
people, that thay are brainwashed or provincial.

Those of us who were around will never 
forget the Days of Madness (1968-9). Computer 
stocks were booming, and their buyers didn't 
Know what it was about; but everywhere there 
were financial people trying to back new com­
puter companies, and everywhere the smart 
computer people who'd missed out on Getting 
Theirs were looking for a deal. 
Datamation for November 1969 was an inch 
thick, there were that many ads for computers 
and accessories. 
At the Fall Joint Computer Conference that 
year in Las Vegas, I had to cover the highlights 
of the exhibits in a hurry, and it took me all 
afternoon, much of it practically at a trot. Then, 
after closing time, I found out there had been 
a whole other building. 
It is important to look at how a lot of these 
companies were backed, the better to understand 
how irrationality bloomed in the system, and 
made the collapse of the speculative stocks in 
1970 quite inevitable. 
A number of companies were started at 
the initiative of people who knew what they were 
doing and had a clear idea, a new technique or 
a good marketing slant. These were in the 
minority, I fear. 
More common were companies started at 
the initiative of somebody who wanted to start 
"another X"— another minicomputer company, 
another terminal company, expecting the product 
somehow to be satisfactory when thrown together 
by hired help. Perhaps these people saw com­
puter companies as something like gold mines, 
putting out a common product with interchangeable 
commodity value. 
The deal, as some of these Wall St. hangers-
on would explain it, was most intriguing. Their 
idea was to create a computer company on low 
capital, "bring it public" (get clearance from the 
SEC to sell stock publicly), and then make a 
killing as the sheep bought it and the price went 
up. Then, if you could get a "track record" 
based on a few fast sales, the increasing price 
of your stock (these are the days of madness, 
remember) makes it possible to buy up other 
companies and become a conglomerate. 
*«••, it*a real. 
Life imitates art 
on Routs 46, N.J. It was very difficult to talk to these people, 
particularly if you were trying to get support for 
a legitimate enterprise built around unusual ideas. 
(Everybody wants to be second.) And what's 
worse, they tended to have that most reprehen­
sible quality: they wouldn't listen. Did they 
want to hear what your idea actually was? "I'll 
get my technical people to evaluate it"-- and 
they send over Joe who once took COBOL. I 
finally figured out that such people are impossible 
to talk to if you're sincere-- it's a quality they 
find unfamiliar and threatening. I don't think 
there's any way a person with a genuine idea 
can communicate with such Wheeler-Dealers; 
they just fix you with a piercing glance and say 
"Yeah, but are we talking about hardware or 
software?" (the two words they know in the 
field). 
"ITS A WHEELER T 
The joker is that if you missed out on all 
this you were much better off. Anyone with a 
genuine idea is being set up for two fleecings: 
the first big one, when they tell you your ideas, 
skills and long-term indenture are worth 2i% 
(if you're lucky) compared to their immense con­
tributions of "business knowhow," and the second, 
when you go public and the underwriter gets 
vast rakeoffs for his incomparable services. What 
is most likely to get lost in all this is any orig­
inal or structured contribution to the world that 
the company was intended, in your mind, to 
achieve. 
In part this is because anyone with tech­
nical knowledge is apparently labelled Silly 
Technician in the financial community, or Impos­
sible Dreamer; it is entrenched doctrine among 
many people there that the man with the original 
idea cannot be allowed to control the direction 
of the resulting company. In one case known 
to me, a man had a beautiful invention (not 
electronic) that could have deeply improved 
American industry, lt was inexpensive, simple 
to manufacture, profoundly effective. He made 
his deal and the company was started, under 
his direction. But it was a trick. When the 
second installment of financing came due (not 
the second round. mind you), the backers 
called for a new deal, and he was skewered. 
Result: no sales, no effect on the world, no 
nothing to speak of. 51 
This is all the sadder because the com­
panies that achieve important things in this field, 
as far as I can see, are those with a unifying 
idea, carried out unstintingly by the man or 
men who believe in it. I think of Olsen's Digital 
Equipment Corporation, Data General, Evans and 
Sutherland Computer Corporation, Vector General. 
This is not to say that a good idea succeeds 
without good management or good breaks: for 
instance, Viatron, a firm which was the darling 
of the computer high-flying stocks, had a per­
fectly sound idea, if not a deep one: to produce 
a video terminal that could be sold for as little 
as $100 a month. But they got overextended, 
and had manufacturing troubles, and that was 
that. (You can now get a video terminal for 
$49 a month, the Hazeltine.) Of course, a lot 
of ideas are hard to evaluate. A man named 
Ovshinsky, for instance, named a whole new 
branch of electronics after himself ("ovonics"), 
and claimed it would make integrated circuits 
cheaper or better than anybody else's. Scoff, 
scoff. Now Ovshinsky has had the last laugh: 
what he discovered some now call "amorphous 
semiconductor technology," and his circuits are 
being used by manufacturers of computer equip­
ment. Another example is one Frank Marchuk, 
whose "laser computer" was announced several 
years ago but hasn't been seen yet. Many com­
puter people are understandably skeptical. 
This is still a field where individuals can 
have a profound influence. But the wrong way 
to try it is through conventional corporate fin­
ancing. Get your own computer, do it in a 
garret, and then talk about ways of getting it 
out to the world.

For (he most part, his; computer;- hnve 
alwayn been rented or leased, rather than 
bought outright. There are various rcanons f'ir 
thia. From the customer's point of view, it 
mskes the whole thing tax-deductible without 
amortisation problems, and means that it's pos­
sible to change part of the package - the model 
of computer or the accessorieB-- more easily. 
And big amounts of money don't have to be 
shelled out at once. 
From the manufacturer's point of view (and 
of course we are speaking mostly of IBM), It is 
advantageous to work the leasing gnme for 
several reasons. Cash inflow is steady. The 
manufacturer Is in continuous communication 
with the customer, and has his ear for changes 
and improvements costing more. Competitors 
are at a disadvantage because the immense 
capital base needed to get into the selling-and-
leaslng game makes competitition impossible. 
Basically, leasing really may be thought 
of as having two parts: the sale of the computer, 
and banking s loan on it; essentially the lease 
payments arc Installment payments, and the real 
profits come after the customer has effectively 
paid the real purchase prk-e and is still forking 
over. 
Many firms other than IBM prefer to sell 
their computers outright. Minicomputers are 
almost always sold rather than rented. However, 
for those who believe in renting or leasing, the 
so-called "leasing firms" have appeared, effec­
tively performing a banking function. They buy 
the computer, you rent or lease it from them, 
and they make the money you would'vo saved 
if you'd bought. 
IBM, now required to sell its computers 
as well ss lease them, keeps making changes 
in its systems which cynics think are done partly 
to scare companies away from leasing, since 
if you've bought the computer you can't catch up. 
(Large computers bought from companies that 
like to sell them, auch as DEC and CDC, do not 
aeem to have this problem.)

Computer progroits. or "software," used 
10 come fr«c with the computer. Bul IBM turned 
around and "unbundled," meaning you had lo 
buy It separately, and Ihere has been some fol­
lowing of this example. However, for users who 
are buying a computer with some conned program 
for a particular purpose, prices are obviously 
for the whole package; it's people who use the 
same computer for a lot of different things that 
have to pay for individual programs. 
There are many small software companies. 
For the cost of a letterhead anyone can start one; 
the question is whether he has anything special 
lo sell. Some people whomp up programs on 
Iheir own which turn out to be quite useful. 
(For instance, one Benjamin Pitman offers a 
magnificent program in Fortran to generate tex­
tual garbage. It's so good it can be used lo 
expand proposals by hundreds of pages. He 
calls it Simplified Integrated Modular Prose (SIMP) 
and lt sells for J10. His address is Computer 
Center, University of Georgia, Athens GA 30602?) 
Obviously, lo create big systems for intri­
cate management purposes requires a great deal 
more effort. Traditionally these are done by 
vast programmer teams working in COBOL or 
the like, constantly fighting wilh monitor programs 
snd chewing up millions of dollar*. However, 
the ntw Quickie Languages (three shown pp. |L-?$) 
may offer great simplification of such programmin^ 
Programs are protected by copyrighl--
Ihflt'e. the only way there can be a software In­
dustry at all-- but since there has been no 
court litigation in Die field, nobody knows what 
the law really is or whht it covers. Everybody 
agrees that traditional copyright precedent covers 
a lol of ground— "derivative works" definitely 
violate copyright, even study guides to textbooks -
-- but no one knows how far this goes. 
Same for patents. The Patent Office has 
granted program patents, notably the one on 
Ihe sorting program of Applied Data Research, 
Inc., but The Patent Office has a profound dis­
taste for this potential extension of its duties, 
unrt it telling everyone that programs aren'l 
patentable, even though they clearly fall within 
its mandate as unique, original prccesscs. 
People who only nud Ihe headlines thirk 
thai the Supreme Court struck down the patent­
ability of programs. No such thing. 
In this light the patents lhat the University 
of Utah has gotten on the halflonc image synthesis 
programs of Warnock and Wylic and Romney (sec 
p. ) are of considerable interest. These 
patents use the "software-as-hardware" ruse: the 
program it. described in detail as taking place in 
a fictitious machine shown In many detailed draw­
ings whose nebulous character is not readily 
seen by the uninitiated: events vaguely taking 
place in "micreprogrammable microprocessors" 
have been neatly foisted on the Patent Office as 
detailed technical disclosure. It's a great game. 
The idea is that the claims are so drawn as to 
cover not just the fictitious machine, but any 
program that should happen to work the same 
way. But such approaches, though c 
previous.patent practices, have not ye! 
litigated in this field. USED COMPUTERS 
While in principle there would seem to be 
every advsntage in buying used computer!., there 
ore certain drawbacks, Service is the main one: 
the manufacturer ia not very helpful about fixing 
discontinued machines, and you may have to know 
how to do it yourself. Even with machines still 
available, you may have trouble getting onto a 
service contract from Ihe manufacturer, since 
It "may have been mistreated." (American Used 
Computer, in Boston, will usually guar ante* 
that its merchandise will be accepted back into 
manufacturer's contract service.) A final draw­
back is price: a popular machine may cost aa 
much used aa new, since they're saving you the 
waiting period. 
It's kind of unfortunate: otherwise usable 
machines get wasted. (But here's waste for 
you: certain well-known laboratories, owned by 
e profit-making monopoly, smash their u*ed com­
puters if nobody wants them within Ihe lab. 
They claim they can't resell them because they 
would then be "competing" with the manufacturers. 
I wish thr conservationists would get on that one.) 
(Notts from all over: it seems thst all the 
surviving numbers of the Philco computer, a nice 
machine but very much discontinued, have ei­
ther gone to the stste of Israel or to Prslt Insti­
tute in Brooklyn. When I spoke at Pratt they 
showed me their Philco machines, chugging heal­
thily, and said they had (I think) some four more 
Phil cos in crates, donated by their original owners. 
ANNOUNCEMENTS 
An eccentric aspect of the computer field 
is the Announcement, the statement by a company 
(or even individual) that he is planning to make 
or sell a certain computer or program. Some 
very odd things happen with announcements in 
this field. (None of this is unique tu computer­
dom, but it goes to unusual extremes here.) 
Under our system it is permissible for any 
person or firm to announce that he will make or 
sell any particular thing, and even if he's lying 
through his teeth, it's not ordinarily considered 
fraud unless money changes hands. Talk is 
cheap. Thus it is common prsctice in American 
industry for people to say that they will soon 
be selling hundred-mile-an-hour automobiles, 
tapioca-powered rocketships. antigravity belts. 
Okay. In the computer world the ssire 
thing happens. Th' strategy depends on the 
announcer's market position. The liitle guys 
arc often bluffing wistfully, hoping someone will 
get interested enough lo put up the money to 
finish the projtct, or the like; the big companies 
are often "testing the water." looking to see 
whether there are potential customers for what 
they hsven'1 even attempted to develop. Announce­
ments by big companies also havt strategic value: 
if they announce something a smaller guy has 
already announced, they may cut him off at Ihe 
pass, even though they htvo no intention of 
delivering. That's just one example. The anal­
ysis of IBM's announcements is a parlor game 
in the field. It has been alleged, for Instance, 
thht IBM announced its 360 computer long be fere 
it was ready to cut off incursions on its cus­
tomers by oilier firms; Control Data, in a recent 
suit, alleged that the Model 90 number* of (he 
360 were announced, and then developed, simply 
tt> destroy Control Data and its own big fast 
mcchincs. These art just examples.

One of the stranger projects of the sixties was a game 
played by the most illustrious programmers at a well-known 
place of research; the place cannot be named here, nor 
the true name of the project, because funds were obtained 
through sober channels, and those who approved were 
unaware of the true nature of the project, a game we shall 
call SURFIT ("SURvival of the FITtest".) Every day after 
lunch the guys would solemnly deliver their programs and 
see who won. It was a sort of analogy to biological evolution. 
The programs would attack each other, and the survivors 
would multiply until only one was left. 
It worked like this. Core memory was divided up 
into "pens," one for each programmer, plus an area for 
the monitor. 
3K'<Kt| 
///\ 
/// ' / / X / 
Each program, or "animal," could be loaded anywhere 
in its pen. The other programs knew the size of the pen 
but not where the animal was in it. Under supervision 
of the special monitor, the animals could by turns bite 
into the other pens, meaning that the contents of core at 
several consecutive locations in the other pen was brought 
back, and changed to zero in its original pen. 
Your animal could then "digest"— that is, analyze--
the contents bitten. Then the other animal got his turn. 
If he was still alive— that is, if the program could still 
function— it could stay in play; otherwise the animal who 
had bitten it to death could multiply itself into the other 
pen. 
The winner was the guy whose animal occupied all 
pens at the end of the run. If he won several times in a 
row he had to reveal how his program worked. 
As the game went on, more and more sophistication 
was poured into the analytic routines, whereby the animal 
analyzed the program that was its victim; so the programmer 
could attack better next time. The programs got bigger 
and bigger. 
Finally the game came to a close. A creature emerged 
who could not be beaten. The programmer had reinvented 
the germ. His winning creature was all teeth, with no 
diagnostic routines; and the first thing it did was multiply 
itself through the entirety of its own pen, assuring that 
no matter where it might just have been bitten, it would 
survive.

THE PHANTOM STRIKES 
All kinds of dumb Jokes snd cartoons circulate among 
the public about computers. Then our friends regale us 
computerfolk with these Jokes and cartoons, snd because 
we don't laugh they say we have no sense of humor. 
Oh we do, we do. But what we laugh at ie rather 
more complicated, and relates to what we think of aa the 
real structure of things. 
Some of the best humor in the field is run in Datamation; 
an anthology called Faith, Hope and Parity reran a lot of 
their best pieces from the early sixties. Classic was the 
Kludge series, a romp describing various activities and 
products of the Kludge Komputer Korporation, whose foibles 
distilled many of the more idiotic things that have been 
done in the field. ("Kludge," pronounced "klooj," is a. 
computerman'B term for a ridiculous machine.) Datamation's 
humorous tradition has continued in a ponderous but extremely 
funny serial that ran in '72 called Also Sprach von Neumann, 
which in mellifluous and elliptical euphemisms described 
the author's adventures st the "airship foundry" and other 
confused companies that had him doing one preposterous 
thing with computers after another. 
Pranks are an important branch of humor in the field. 
Here are some that will give you a sense of it. 
ZAP THE 94 
One of the meaner pranks was a program that ran 
on the old 7094. It could fit on one card (in binary), and 
put the computer in an inescapable loop. Unfortunately 
the usual "STOP" button was disabled by this program, 
so to atop the program one would eventually have to pull 
the big emergency button. This burnt out all the main 
registers. 
TIMES SQUARE LIGHTS 
One of the weirder programs waa the operator-waker-
upper somebody wrote for the 7094. It was a big program, 
and what it did was DISPLAY ALPHABETICAL MESSAGES 
ON THE CONSOLE LIGHTS, eliding past like the news in 
Times Square. You put in this program and followed it 
with the message; the computer's console board would light 
up and the news would go by. Since the lights usually 
blink In uninteresting patterns, thla was very startling. 
This program was extremely complex. Since the 
94 displayed the contents of all main registers and trap, 
arithmetic and overflow lights, it was necessary to do very 
weird things in the program to turn these lights on and 
off at the right times. 
THE TIME-WASTER 
In one company, for some reason, it was arranged 
that large and long-running programs had priority over 
short quick ones. Very well: someone wrote a counterattack 
program occuping several boxes of punch cards, to which 
you added the short program you really wanted run, and 
a card specifying how long you wanted the first part of 
the program to grind before your real one actually started. 
This would blink lights and spin tapes impressively 
and lengthen the run of your program to whatever'you wanted. 
BOMBING THE TIME SHARE 
One of the classic bed-boy pranks is to bomb time­
sharing systems-- that ia, foul them up and bring them to 
a halt. Many programmers have don* this; one has told 
me It's a wonderful way to get rid of your aggressions. 
Of course, it con damage other people's work (especially 
if disks are bombed); and it always gels the ay stem program-
mere hopping mad, because it means you've defied their 
authority and maybe found a hole they don't know about. 
Hare are a couple of examoles. The way this story is told, ona of the time-sharing 
systems at MIT would go down at completely mysterious 
times, with all of core and disk being wiped out, and 
the lineprinter printing out THE PHANTOM STRIKES. 
For a long time the guilty program could not be 
found. Finally it was discovered that the bomb was 
hidden in an old and venerable statistics program 
previously believed to be completely reliable. The 
reason the phantom didn't always strike was that the 
Bomb part queried the system clock and made a pseudo­
random decision whether to bomb the system depending 
on the instantaneous setting of the clock. This is why 
it took so long to discover; the program usually bided 
its time and behaved properly. 
Apparently this was the revenge of a disgruntled 
programmer, long since departed. Not only that, but 
his revenge was thorough: the Bomb part of the program 
was totally kni*'ed into the rest of it, it was a very 
important program that had to be run a lot with different 
data, and no documentation existed, making it for 
practical purposes impossible to change. 
The final solution, so the story goes, was this: 
whenever the rowdy program had to be run, the rest 
of the machine was cleared or put on protect, so it ran 
and had its fits in majestic solitude. 
2. RHBOMB 
The time-share at the Labs, never mind which 
Labs, kept going down. Mischief was suspected. Mis­
chief was verified: a program called RHBOMB, sub­
mitted by a certain programmer with the initials R.H., 
was responsible, and turned out always to be present 
when the terminals printed TSS HAS GONE DOWN. It 
was verified by the systems people that the program 
called RHBOMB was in fact a Bomb program, with no 
other purpose than to take down the time-sharing system. 
R.H. was spoken to sternly and it did not hap­
pen again. 
However, some months later a snoopy systems 
programmer noted that a file called RHBOMB had been 
stored on disk. Rather than have R.H. scalped pre­
maturely, he thought he would check the contents. 
He sat down at the terminal and typed in the com­
mand. PRINT RHBOMB. But before he could see its 
contents, the terminal typed instead 
TSS HAS GONE DOWN 
But this was incredible! A program so virulent lhat 
if you just tried to read its contents, without running 
it, it still bombed the system! The systems man 
rushed from the room to see what had gone wrong. 
He did so prematurely. The contents of the 
new file RHBOMB were simply 
TSS HAS GONE DOWN 
followed by thousands of nuU codes, which were sil­
ently being fed to the Teletype, 10 per second, pre­
venting it from signalling that it was ready for the 
next thing. 
Games with computer programs are universally enjoyed 
in the computer community . Wherever there are graphic 
displays there is usually a veraion of the game Spacewar. 
(Bee Steward Brand's Spacewar piece In Rolling Stone, 
mentioned elsewhere.) Spacewar, like many other computer-
based games, is played between people, using the computer 
as an animated board which can work out the results of 
complex rules. 
Some installations have computer games you can play 
against; you arc effectively "playing against the house," 
trying to outfox a program. This is rarely easy. A variety 
of techniques, hidden from you , can be used. 
When "a computer" plays a game, actually somebody's 
program is carrying out a set of rules that the programmer 
haa laid out In advance. The program has s natural edge: 
it can check a much longer serlea of possibilities In looking 
for the best move (according to the criteria in the program). 
There Is s more complicated approach: the computer 
can be programmed to test for tha best strategy in a game. 
This la much more complicated, and ia ordinarily considered 
an example of "artificial intelligence" (aee "The God-Builders," 
elsewhere in thla book). A Grand Fad among computerfolk in the last couple 
of years has been the game of " Life," invented by John 
Horton Conway. 
The rules appeared in the Scientific American in 
October 1970, in Martin Gardner's games column, and the 
whole country went wild. Gardner was swamped with 
results (many published in Feb. 71); after a couple more 
issues Gardner washed his hands of it, and it goes on 
in its own magazine. 
The game is a strange model of evolution, natural 
selection, quantum mechanics or pretty much whatever 
else you want to see in it. Part of its initial fascination 
was that Conway didn't know its long-term outcomes, and 
held a contest (eventually won by a group from MIT). 
The rules are deceptively simple: suppose you have 
a big checkerboard. Each cell has eight neighbors: the 
cells next to it up, down and diagonally. 
Time flows in the game by "generations." The pattern 
on the board in each generation determines the pattern 
on the board in the next generation. The game part simply 
consists of trying out new patterns and seeing what things 
result in the generations after it. Each cell is either OCCUPIED 
or EMPTY . A cell becomes occupied (or "is born") if exactly 
three of its neighbors were full in the previous generation. 
A cell stays occupied if either two or three of its neighbors 
were occupied in the previous generation. All other cells 
become empty ("die"). 
These rules have the following general effect: patterns 
you make will change, repeat, grow, disappear in wild 
combinations. Some patterns move across the screen in 
succeeding generations ("gliders"). Other patterns pulsate 
strangely and eject gliders repetitively (glider guns). 
Some patterns crash together in ways that produce moving 
glider guns. Weird. 
While the game of Life, as you can see from the rules, 
haa nothing to do with computers intrinsically, obviously 
computers are the only way to try out complex patterns 
in a reasonable length of time.

Tln-ir name makes people think they're a war protest group, 
but actually Ihe R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R.S, of Princeton. N ,J. are n 
bunch of kids who play with computers. They're nil young; mcmbei 
are purged when they finish high school. Their clubroom la at 
Princeton University, but the Initiative la strictly theirs. 
The name stands Tor "Radically Emphatic Students Interested 
In Science. Technology and Other Research Subjects." Computers 
are not all they do--they've also gotten Inlo slot racing nnd the 
game of Diplomacy-- but computers arc what Ihoy're known for. 
The Resistors (lei's spell 11 the short way) exhibit regularly at 
the computer conferences. and have startled numerous people 
with the high quality of their work. They've been invited to 
conferences abroad. They have built various language procei 
and done graphics! lately their fad la working with the LDS-1 
In Princeton's Chemistry Department. 
r»F-t 
Where do they learn il all? They lcact 
Newcomers hang around, learn computer talk. work on projects , 
and tease each other. They also use the informal trade channels, 
subscribing to magazines and filling oul information request 
cards under such company names as Plebney International Signal 
Division and Excallbur Wax Fruit. 
The great thing about these klda Is their zany flippancy. 
They've never failed, they've never been ofruld for their jobs, 
and so they combine the zest of the young with their expertise. 
Their forms of expression arc aa startling to professionals as 
they are to outsiders: don't say anything ponderously if it can 
be said playfully. Don't say "bit ricld" if you can say "funny 
bits;" don't say "alphanumeric buffer" If you can soy "quick brown 
fox box; " don't say "interrupt signal" If you cai

They have varied backgrounds. The father of one Is n bulcl 
the falher of another Is one of ihe country's foremost intellectuals. 
(None of that matters to the kids.) I have dined in a number ot 
their homes, and find this in common: their parents show them 
great respect, love and trust. Indeed, Resistor parents have 
expressed some surprise to learn that their children's work Is 
at the full-fledged professional level. The important thing, lo 
the parents, is that the kids are working on constructing things 
Ihey enjoy. 
P..E.S.I.S.T.O. a.: 
after infamous 
Onega ceremony. 
Tho trade press is umblvalcnt toward the Resistor*. On 
the one hand they make good copy. (Al one Spring Joint they 
had the only working time-shoring demo-- on a carpel next to 
a phOne booth.) On the other, Ihcy sometimes Nccm hriitty and 
publicity-hungry . like many celebrities. (At another Spring 
Joint they dug up an IBM Songbook und serenaded the guys ut 
the IBM pavilion, who hud to act nice about it.) So they don't 
get written up in computer magazines so much anymore. 
I first met the Resistors in 1370. and started hanging around 
with them for two reasons. First, Ihcy ore perfectly delightful: 
enthusiastic in the way Ihnl most Adults forego, und very wilty . 
To them computer talk was not u thing ii|>;irt. us it Is Cur both out­
siders end many professionals. 
Secondly, und this was the self-seeking impect, I noted 
that these kids were quite export, and interested in Riving me 
advice where computer professionals would not. They got interested 
in helping me wilh my (perhaps quixotic) Xanadu"" project (see 
flip side). This was enough lo keep me visiting for a couple of 
years. Now, some people arc too proud lo auk children for informa­
tion. This is dumb. Information is where you find it. 
The last I hcurd. the Resistors were ut work in ;i COBOL 
compiler for the Pl)l'-ll. hoping it would save the local high school 
from the disastrous (10 them) purchase of an IBM 1130. (Since 
the school's intent WOB lo teach business programming, Ihcy hoped 
that the avuilabillty of COBOL would encourage the school to buy 
the more powerful und less expensive PUP-11.) 
The Resistors urc few, but I think they are very important 
in principle, an cxislencc proof. They show how silly and artificial 
is our edifice of pedagogy , with ull its sequences und sterilizations, 
end how anybody cun learn anything in Ihe right atmosphere, 
stripped of Its pomposities. The Resistors arc not obsessed with 
computers; their love at computers is part of their love of everything, 
and everything is whut computers arc for. R.W.\J.T.0.|y. frtteta,. "7

of several hundred thousand dollars. 
Did they rale free subscriptions to computer ma go tines* 
I asked. Could they claim Ihcy really "make decisions affecting 
the purchase of computers"? 
"Of course we do!" was the reply. "All together: shall

salesman of burg lar alarms was about to arrive. "Let's have 
a little fun with him." said Gaston. The kids were to be introduced 
as Gaston's children, I was an uncle. We took our stations. 
The salesman may have realized ho was walking into a trap 
from all the strangely beaming adolescents that stood in the living 
room. He got out his wares and started to demonstrate the burglar 
iilarm, but it didn't go right. Peter, standing in front of Ihe equip­
ment with n dcmonicully vucuous grin, had reversed n diode behind 
his back so thul Ihe alarm rang continuously unless you broke 
the light beam. 
"Itumpf," said Gaston, "you wan

running.

John was typing this from the other Teletype in the barn. 
The salesman stared nt the Teletype He looked around 
at our cherubic smiling faces, lie looked at the Teletype. "That's 
all right," said the salesman. "But now I'd like to show you a 
real security system. . ." And it was back to the old burglar 
alarm. 
The public is thoroughly confused about 
computers, and the press and publicists are 
scarcely free from blame. IT'S TIME FOR EX­
PLANATIONS. People want to know what computer 
systems really do-- no more of this "latest 
space-age technology" garbage. Mr. Business* 
•an, Mr. Writer, are you man enough to start 
telling it straight? 
The computer priesthood, unfortunately, 
often wants to awe people with, or unduly 
stress, the notion of the computer being in­
volved in a particular thing at all. It is 
time for everybody to stop being impressed by 
this and get on with things. Don't just copy-
edit what they give you. Nose around and 
really find out, then write it loud and clear.

It is only by clarifying distinction; 
' going to get anything 
7. Don't say "a ma 1functioning computer' 
(hardware error) if the computer functioned 
as it was directed on an incorrect program 
(software error). (And remember that the 
best programmers make mistakes, so that a 
catastrophic bug in a system is no sign that 
it was programmed by an incompetent, only 
that it isn't finished.) 
8. (A particular point about graphics. 
See flip side.) Don't say "TV screen" if a 
computer screen is not TV, i.e., S2S hori­
zontal lines that you can see on the screen 
if you look for them. (See p. >»\fc versus p. 
£w\?J.) HOW ABOUT: "visual display screen"? 
-- you can add, "on which the computer can 
draw moving lines," or whatever else the 
particular system does. 
9. Don't assume that your audience is 
computer-illiterate. 
10. Don't assume that lt can't all be 
said simply. Only lazy or hard-pressed write! 
are unclear. 
11. Do not use cutesy-talk, particular 
that which suggests that computers have an in­
trinsic character. By "cutesy" I mean sen­
tences like "Scientists have recently taught 
a computer to play chess," Mis-Leads like 
"What does a computer sound like?" (when talk­
ing about music constructed by a particular 
program in a particular way), and awe-struck 
' icrlptlons like, "At last the Space Age has 
come to the 1 bus! 
12. Do not use the garbage term "compu­
terized," unless there is a clear statement 
of whore the computer is in the system, what 
the computer is doing and how. A "computer­
ized traffic system," for instance, could be 
any damn thing, but a "system of traffic light 
under computer control, using various timing 
techniques still under development," says 
something. 
13. Don't put in cliches as fact, for 
example by the use Jit such terms as "mathe­
matical" or "computer scientist" unless they 
really apply. Do not imply any mathematical 
character unless you know the system possesses 
it: many programs contain no operations that 
can fairly be called mathematical. Similarly,

Computer people nay best be thought of 
as a new ethnic group, very »"ch unto them­
selves. Now, it is very hard to characterize 
ethnic groups in words, and certain to give 
offense, but if I had to choose one word for 
them it would be elfin. We are like those 
little people down among the mushrooms, skit­
tering around completely preoccupied with 
unfathomable concerns and seemingly indif­
ferent to normal humanity. In the moonlight 
(i.e., pretty late, with snacks around the 
equipment) you may hear our music. 
Most importantly, the first rule in deal­
ing with leprechauns applies ex hypothes i to 
computer people: when one promises to do you 
a magical favor, keep your eyes fixed on hla 
until he has delivered. Or you will get what 
you deserve. Programmers' promises are notor-
iously unkept. 
But the dippy glories of this world, the 
earnestness and whimsy, are something else. 
A real computer fre»k, if you ask him for a 
program to print calendars, will write a pro­
gram that gives you your choice of Gregorian, 
Julian, Old Russian and French Revolutionary, 
in either small reference printouts or big 
ones you can write in. 
Computer people have many ordinary traits 
that show up in extraordinary ways-- loyalty, 
pride, temper, vengefulness and so on. They 
have particular qualities, as well. Of dogged-
ness and constrained fantasy that enable them 
to produce in their work. (Once at lunch I 
asked a tablefull of programmers what plane 
figures they could get out of one cut through 
a cube. I got about three times as many ans­
wers .as I thought there were.) 
Unfortunately there is no room or time 
to go on about all these things-- see Biblio­
graphy-- but in this particular area of fan­
tasy and emotion I have observed some interes­
ting things. 
One common trait of our times-- the tech­
nique of obscuring oneself-- may be more com­
mon among computer people than others (see 
"The Myth of the Machine." p. <f , and also 
"Cybercrud," p. J }. Perhaps a certain dis-
gruntlement with the world of people fuses 
with fascination for (and envy of?) machines. 
Anyway, m»ny of us who have gotten along badly 
with people find here a realm of abstractions 
to invent and choreograph, privately and with 
continuing control. A strange house for the 
emotions, this. Like Hegel, who became most 
eloquent and ardent when he was lecturing at 
his most theoretical, it is interesting to be 
among computer freaks boisterously explaining 
the cross-tangled ramifications of some system 
they have seen or would like to build. 
(A syndrome to ponder. I have seen it 
more than once: the technical person who, with 
someone he cares about, cannot stop talking 
about his ideas for a project. A poignant 
type of Freudian displacement.) 
A sad aspect of this, incidentally, is by 
no means obvious. This is that the same com­
puter folks who chatter eloquently about sys­
tems that fascinate them tend to fall dark and 
silent while someone else is expounding his own 
fascinations. You would expect that the person 
with effulgent technical enthusiasms would 
really click with kindred spirits. In my ex­
perience this only happens briefly: hostili­
ties and disagreements boil out of nowhere to 
cut the good mood. My only conclusion is that 
the same spirit that originally drives us mut­
tering into the clockwork feels threatened 
when others start monkeying with what has been 
controlled and private fantasy. 
This can be summed up as follows: NOBODY 
WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT ANOTHER GUY'S SYSTEM. 
Here as elsewhere, things fuse to block human 
communication: envy, dislike of being domina­
ted, refusal to relate emotionally, and what­
ever else. Whatever computer people hear 
about, it seems they immediately try to top. 
Which Is not to say that computer people 
are mere clockwork lemons or Bettelheimian 
robot-children. But the tendencies are there.

In the early throes of computer enthusiasm, 
it ii easy to suppose that anything tan be done 
by computer-- that is, any thine involving the 
chewing or diddling of information. This is 
decldealy not so. 
For Instance, lt Is easy enough, and often 
practical, to have a computer do something a few 
mi 111 on tines. But it is almost never practical 
to have a computer do something s trillion times. 
Why? Well, let's say (for the **ke~oT sTSpli-
city) that a certain program loop takes 1/1000 
of a second. To do it a thousand times, then, 
would take one second, and to do it a million 
tines would take a thousand seconds, or about 
seventeen minutes. But to do it a trillion times 
now, would mean doing it 17,000,000 "minutes. or ' 
over thirty years. 
Now, you will note that even if you speed up 
thst loop to 1/1,000,006 of a second, a trillion 
repetitions will take almost twelve days which 
is obviously going to need some justifying, even 
assuming that it Is otherwise feasible. 
(For problems of this type people begin 
thinking about building special hardware, any­
way. It will be noted, for instance, that the 
PDP-I6-- see p. JT - - lets you compile your own 
special equipment for problems thst need eter­
nal repetitions. 
COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSIONS 
One kind of thing that's too much to do 
is generally called a combinatorial explosion--
that is, a problem that '^explodes" into too 
many things to do. for instance, consider the 
game of chess. Just because you can write a 
program to look ahead at all the possible out­
comes of, say, tic-tac-toe, that doesn't mean 
you can consider ail the possibilities of chess. 
To look at "all" the possibilities just a few 
moves ahead involves you in trillions of 
calculations. Renembcr about trillions? And 
it turns out that there are a lot of problems 
like that. Basically, an opernl i rig s y s 1 cm is 
program thst supervises all the other p 
grams in s computer. For this 
also called a supervi sor or a 
Because the operating system i 
be in charge, many computers nun 
cial wired-in instructions that r 
operating system can use. This j 
other programs from taking complete control 
of the machine. 
Operating systems cone in all sues. 
The bigger ones take up a lot of computer 
tine because they have to do a lot. The 
smallest kind,which are really kind of 
different, are just to help a single pro­
grammer move quickly between his basic 
programs. {A typical such system is DEC's 
DOS, or Disk Operating 5ystem, which you 
can get with the PDP-11.) This system is 
really a kind of butler that keeps track of 
where your basic programs are stored on disk 
and brings then in for you quickly. 
A step up is the Batch Monitor, or op­
erating system set up for Batch Processing 
(see p.5~£3r). In batch processing, pro-
grans go through the computer as if on a 
conveyer belt, one at a time (or in some 
systems several at a tine). The operating 
system shepherds then. 
Hatch processing is used when programs 
don't need any interaction with human users. 
(Or, and this is more common, when human 
users want tine-sharing but can't ge_t it; 
see below.) A multiprogramming operating 
system is one that allows several different 
prograns (or conveyor-belt sequences of 
batch programs) to operate at one tine. 
(This is how most IBM J60s are used.) IS

.Then there is the problem of "Turing im­
possibility." Turing was a mathematician who 
discovered that some things can be done se­
quentially in a finite amount of tine, snd 
some things can't, such as proving certain 
types of mathematical theorem. In other words, 
anything that has to do things in sequence--
whether a computer or a nind of God, if any--
cannot possibly know anything which is not 
Turing-computable, Another important limita­
tion. 
On a more practical level, though, there 
ar* just lots of things which nobody has figur­
ed out how to do in any feasible way, or are 
just now figuring out different systematic ways 
of doing. (For s favorite such area of mine, 
compare the different conputer half-tone image 
synthesis systems described on pp. DM "ILto 
DM "J"! .) 
Thus you see that figgering < 
doing stuff is still one of the principal as­
pects of the computer field. (Whole journals 
are devoted to it, such as CACM, JACM and so on.) 
But then of course, every few years there 
comes a new movement in the field that bodes to 
make us start all over. 
One such trend is called structured prog­
ramming . being promulgated by a Dutch research-
er named Dijkstra, among others. The idea of 
structured programming is to restrict computing 
languages in certain ways and "eliminate the 
GO TO," i.e., no longer have jumps to labeled 
places in programs. By dividing computer prog­
rams up only in certain ways, goes this school 
of thought, the programs can perhaps be proven 
workable, in the mathematical sense, rather 
than just demonstrated to work, as they are now--
a notoriously error-prone situation. If the 
Dljkstra school is correct, we say have to 
start all over again with a new bunch of prog­
ramming languages. 
These remarks give you the flavor of some 
restrictions and lines of development. The rest 
of this page is devoted to The Great Software 
Problem-- the Operating System.

We have no space here to discuss OS,

which is just si well: it Li a notoriously 
heavy-handed system, elaborated with what

equivalent complications, the programmer

programs, as the 160 demands.) The pro­
grammer must even set s»lde the previous 
programmer's information in "SAVE AREAS," 
which is liks a restaurant guest having to

and return them when he leaves. Several of

Then there is time-sharing. 
Tine-sharing means the simultaneous use 
of one computer by several different users 
at once. It's basically a complex form of 
nultiprogrammi ng. 
In principle this is like a la:y sua an. 
The centra) conputer works on one user's pro­
gram for a while, then on another's... until 
it is back to the first user. 
There are basically two kinds of tine-
sharing: tinc-sharing where you can only use 
certain facilities or languages, and time­
sharing where you can use all the facilities 
of the computer (including programming in the 
computer"s assembly 1 annuage). 
Examples of restricted time-sharing are 
the various minicomputer systens that arc 
available which time-share the BASIC language. 
(Nova and PDP-11 and Hewlett-Packard, for it (• was created by keneny and Kurtz, 
ited the BASIC language to be used 
;ee p. (fc ). 
BIBLIOGRAPHY Sorae examples of unrestricted time­
sharing arc the PDP-10 (see p. lo), Dart­
mouth's DTSS, Honeywell's MULT1CS, IBM's TSO, 
and General Electnc's MARK III. 
Bigger is not necessarily better. For 
instance, there are time-shared versions of 
BASIC that run on big IBM computers. How­
ever, tt may very well be that big IBM in­
stallations can save money by eliminating 
this function and buying instead a small 
Hewlett-Packard minicomputer to run their 
BASIC on, thereby supplying BASIC to more 
users at less cost and freeing the 360 for 
whatever it is IBM systems do better. 
Restricted time-sharing, with only one 
or a few languages offered, is much easier to 
provide for than full tine-sharing. 
Full time-sharing is always shared with 
batch. In other words, the computer, darting 
among users, still finds some tine to Jevote 
to the batch stream. 
Time-sharing is self-1imi11ng. That is, 
the more users are signed onto a tine-sharing 
system at a given moment, the more slowly the 
system responds to all of them. 
Operating systems i 
program. They take a lc. __ 
lime: tor instance, Dartmouth'* time-sharing 
operating system, taking as ouch as 211 of 
Che computer's time, is considered efficient. 
The importance of time-sharing is not in 
terms of "raw" efficiency, that is, the cost 
of each million operations, but in terms of 
human efficiency, the ability of each user to 
get so much more out of the computer by using 
Interactive programs and languages. 
OPERATING SYSTEMS TRICKERY 
Swapping means transferring one user's 
program out of core memory in order to move 
in somebody else's program. Thi* can happen 
very rapidly, and even when it's done to you 
the < i continuous possessloi 
Paging is one of the Great Abstruse 
Problems of modern operating system*. The 
problem is this: you've always got fast ex­
pensive memory and cheap slow memory. How 
can the operating systea store most of your 
program in cheap flow memory and still predict 
which parts you'll need soon enough to get 
them In there for you? In the hotter syitems, 
indeed, the operating system tries to predict 
what's most Important and move It to a fast 
little memory called a cache. Thi* »r*a is 
so bitarr* and complicated I prefer not to 
think about it. "Minis for me," says Mr. 
Natural. Their computer arrived in fall '63. 
Their time-sharing system went into opera­
tion in spring '64, prograwneJ mostly by 
Dartmouth students. and has grown and i im­
proved continuously since then. On that 
basis: programmed bv students. 
' „..,„«. 
J The Dartmouth conputer philosophy--
i.e., the idea carried through by John 
Kemeny and Tom k'urt;--was that a conputer 
is like a library: its services should he 
iree to all in a community, paid for 
through some general fund. 
Students and faculty at Dartnouth 
use it free. (Unless they have grants.) 
You can use it too, if you pay. 
The result: everybody at Dartmouth 
uses the computer. It's always running, 
(ahem) six days a week. There are almost 
two hundred terminals around the campus; 
peak afternoon usage is about a hundred 
and fifty. Freshmen learn BASIC first 
thing, after which the computer is a 
standing facility, to he used in courses 
in music, sociology, literature, history, 
engineering or whatever; for independent 
research; or just for fun and canes and 
showing off to visitors,

terminals. I The connand i

"any TuJJy-JudJ i es insist that computer 
usage should be billed, is it is on most 
college campuses" That is essentially the 
Calvinist view. But what if wc treated li­
braries like that? It would probably cost 
S10 just to borrow any book. The point is 
that it we bcTTevc that certain conditions 
are a social good, then we should be flex­
ible about how to inplemcnt them. (See Arthur 
W. Luehrmann and John H. Nevison, "Computer 
Use under a Free-Access Policy, Science, II 
May 74, 9S7-961. This article continues this 
line of argument and further describes the 
Dartmouth billing system.) 
Anyway, Dartmouth will sell you its time­
sharing system for about S?500 a month (and 
you'll need a computet setup that begins at 
517,500 a month). That'll run SO terminals. 
A bigger setup will cost more. But that gets

No way can we here get into the prose and 
cons (both senses) of the myriad time-sharing 
services that are available. An excellent 
summary of fifty-six different time-sharing 
services (variously using computers by Honey­
well, IBM, DEC, Univac, CDC, Xerox and 
Burroughs) appeared in the February, 1973

HfRf THEY COMC—He 
Microprocessors are what's happening. 
Computers cost several thousand bucks on up. 
Microprocessors cost several hundred on up, and 
that price range is falling fast. 
So»e microprocessors are already on integra­
ted circults, postage stamp-sized electronic 
tangles that are simply printed and baked, rather 
than wired up; this means there is effectively 
no bottom limit to the price of microprocessors. 
Hark this wel 1. It means thst in a few years 
there will be a microprocessor in your refriger­
ator, your typewriter, your lawnmower, your car, 
and possibly your wallet. (If you don't believe 
this, look what happened to pocket calculators in 
the last couple of years. The chip those arc 
built around costs five bucks. But next come the 
programmable chips, the microprocessors.) 
Microprocessors should not be called micro­
computers , a tern that seems to have captivated 
Hall Street lately. "Microcomputer" just means 
any teeny computer; but there is an exact and 
crucial difference between an ordinary computer 
e) and a microprocessor (what-
licroprocessor el computer. 
You will remember from the "Rock Bottom" 
section (pp. 3Z-3) that every computer has an 
internal language of binary patterns or "aachine 
language" (i11 ustrated in horrendous detai1 in 
the program called "Bucky's tfristwatch," pp.33-4). 
Well, a microprocessor has two levels, 
has an upper-level program follower with it 
binary program; but each instruction of th 
upper-level program is in turn carried out 
program follower running a program at a lowe: 
level-- called a nlcroprog' by • 
This has • r extraordinary ramifications. 
First of all, it means that the upper-level 
binary language can be anything you want-- that . 
any feasible computer language--because each of 
its instructions, in turn, will be carried 
program. by 
This for . __. , that machines can 
be created which may be programmed directly in some 
higher-level language, such as APL (note Canadian 
machine described on p. Z_i) or BASIC (note one of 
the Hewlett-Packard machines described on p. 17 ). 
Th* characters in the upper-level program (APL or 
BASIC), stepped through by the upper-level program 
follower, cause the lower-level program foilower to 
carry out the operations of the language. 
Second, the machine costs less to Bake than an 
ordinary computer. The reason is that the archi­
tecture of ordinary computers is designed now (at 
last) for programmer convenience. Thus a machine 
like the PDP-11, which in principle does nothing 
any other computer doesn't do, is still more desir­
able than most, because its instructions arc so 
well designed. It is clear and sensible to the pro­
grammer, with the result that programming it takes 
less time and costs less money. 
Microprocessors reverse this trend. The lower-
level structure of registers and instructions can be 
anything that is convenient to manufacture, whether 
-* -**. programmers like it. Low manufacturing cost 
' ' i design criteria. ! of the i 
The purpose of microprocessors, you see, is 
generally to be hidden in other equipment and do 
some simple thing over and over; not to have their 
programs changed around all the time as on an ordi­
nary computer. 
There are exceptions, computers which have a 
second level down where you can put microprograms; 
and these are called, sensibly enough, microprogram-
Sable computers. They are bought and set up with 
regular computer accessories, plus facilities to 
change the microprograms. Thus they cost a lot more 
but oh, they do so much more for you. You can design 
your own computer-- i.e., its in*truetion-sat-- and 
then create it, with a microprogram. (See the Stan­
dard Computer and the Met.-4, nearby.) TWO LF.VELS, TWO SPEEDS 
The trick that makes this alt work-- whether 
for the hidden-away type or the computer type of 
microprocessor-- is that the lower level has a ouch 
faster memory than the upper level. This means 
that an upper-level word can be taken, and looked 
up in the lower level, and all the lower-level steps 
carried out, very fast compared to the upper-level 
memory. Many such machines, for instance, have 
lower-level speeds in the nanoseconds (billionth: 
of a second), while the upper-level speeds are mere­
ly in the microseconds (millionths of a second).

Sooo 
I have heard no computer more widely 
praised among computer people than the Bur­
roughs SOOO (replaced by the 5SO0). The SOOO 
was designed about 1960 by Edward Claser and 
Bob BaTton. It was designed to be used only 
with higher languages, not allowing program­
mers access to the binary instructions them­
selves. Indeed, it was particularly designed 
to be used with ALGOL, which would have been 
the standard language if IBM had allowed it 
(see p. 31 ) and is still the "international" 
language. 
Because of this approach, its main regis­
ters were to be hidden from the programmer, 
and attention centered instead upon the stack, 
a high-level programming device (see box on 
Stacks). However, index registers were added 
to make it better for Fortran. 
The SOOO was marketed as an "all-purpose" 
computer with an operating system, anticipating 
IBM's 360 of a few years later. Indeed, after 
the 360 was announced, Burroughs sales picked 
up, because IBM salesmen were at last-promoting 
the concepts that customers hadn't understood 
when they heard about them from Burroughs 
salesmen years before.

Apparently their sales force is something else 
unfortunately. I once spent some time with a

information unless I demonstrated that the

The Stack is a mechanism-- either built 
into the computer ("hardware") or incorpora­
ted in a program ("software") which allows a 
computer to keep track of a vast number of 
different activities, interruptions and com­
plications at the same time. 
Basically, it Is a mechanism which allows 
a program to throw something over its shoulder 
in order to do something else, then reach hack 
over its shoulder to get back what it was 
previously working on. But no matter how many 
things it throws over its shoulder, everything 
stays orderly and continues to work smoothly, 
till it has resumed everything and finished 
them all. 
It goes like this: if the program has 
to set aside one thing, it puts that one thing 
in core memory at a place specified by a 
number called a stack pointer. Then it adds 
one to the stack pointer, to be ready in case 
something else has to go on the stack. This 
is called a PUSH. 
"ruriT 
When a program is ready to resume a prev­
ious activity, it subtracts one from the 
stack pointer and fetches whatever that stack 
pointer points to. This is called a POP. 
It may not be immediately obvious, but 
this trick has immense power. For instance, 
we may stack any number of things together--
the addresses of programs, data we are moving 
between programs, intermediate results, and 
codes that show what the computer was doing 
previously, 
Using stacks, programs may use each other 
very freely. It is possibIe, for instance, 
to jump among subroutines-- independent little 
programs-- willy-nilly, using a stack to keep 
track of where you've been. 
In this case the stack holds the previous 
locations and intermediate data, so that the 
program follower can go back where it came 
from at the end of each subroutine. STICK

Stacks are also used for handling "interrupts" 
-- signals from outside that require the 
computer to set aside one job for another. 
Having a built-in hardware stack enables the 
interrupts to pile up without .-nnfi.tinn-
Finally, stack arithmetic, like that done on 
the BurrougK^SbUO, enables arithmetic (and 
other algebraic types of activity) to be han­
dled without setting aside registers or space

is deeply simplified, because any device with 
a proper bus interface can simply be plugged 
onto the bus. 
It does mean a lot more complexity of

going to put your car's electrical system on

once what is snd isn't working, and hook up 
new goodies easily. The PDP-11 is not a beginner's computer. 
But the power and elegance of its architecture 
have established it, since its introduction in 
1970, as perhaps the foreraost smal1 computer 
in the world. 
Actually, though, we can't be too sure 
about the word "small." Because as successive 
parts of the line arc unveiled, it becomes in­
creasingly clear that this line of "small" 
computers has been designed to include some 
very powerful machines and coupling techniques 
among them; and it would seem that we haven't 
seen everything yet.

The PDP-11 was designed by C, Gordon Bell 
and his associates at Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
sity. In designing the architecture, and es­
pecially the ins truetion-set, they simulated 
a wide variety of possibilities before the 
final design was decided. The resulting ar­
chitecture is extremely efficient and powerful 
(see box, "The ll's Modes"). well. 
There are eight main registers. Two, 
though, function specially: the program coun­
ter (that part of the program follower that 
holds the number of the next instruction), and 
the hardware stack pointer, both follow the 
s.ime programming rules as the main registers--
jn unusual technique. Thus a jump in the pro­
gram is simply a "move" instruction, in which 
the next program address is "moved" into main 
register *7, the program counter. 
In addition, all external devices seem to 
the program to be stored in core memory. That 
is, the interface registers of accessories 
ri.ive "addresses" numerically similar to core 
locations-- so the program just "moves" data, 
,ith MOVt instructions, to doorways in core, 
ilhis is facilitated by the automatic handling 
of previously bothersome stuff, like Ready, 
Wait and Done bits.) 
Physically all devices are simply attached 
to a great sash of wires called a Unibus. (See 
Grand Bus box.)

A strange unseen curse seems to haunt the 360 series; in­
deed, some cynics even think it results from deliberate poli­
cies of IBM! Yet the 360 (and its software) seem somehow or­
ganized to make programs inefficient and slow; to make programs 
big, needing lots of core memory (with numerous enticements for 
the programmer to take up more); to prevent the compatibilities 
that are so widely advertised, except through expensive options; 
to make things excessively complicated, thus locking in both its

intricacies that are somehow unnecessary on other brands of FI«T OF Tl|f

Control Data's 6600 computer was the 
first really big computer. The first one was 
delivered around 196S. The machine and its 
operating system, CHIPPEWA, were created by 
Seymour Cray and his team in hinterland Min-
lixtreme speed was designed into the com­
puter in a number of ways. The main computer 
has no input or output at all; this is hand­

The architecture of the 360 was quite simil

form of addressing was adopted, called "base-
register addressing." This had certain advantages for the oper­
ating system that was planned, and was thought to be sufficient­
ly powerful that you wouldn't need Indirect Addressing. Two 
main registers were required, one holding a "base" more or less 
equal to the program's starting address, and an "index register,' 
whose contents are added to the base to specify an address. 
Often a third number, or "offset," is added as well. 
The ides of this technique is that programs can be "relo­
catable," operating anywhere in core memory. A few instructions 
at the beginning of each program can ascertain where it is run­
ning from, and establish the Base accordingly. 
The basic idea of the 360 seems to have been doped out for 
multiprogramming, or the simultaneous running of several pro­
grams in core, a feature IBH has pushed heavily with this com-
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE 360* 
The main differences between the 360 and the PDP-6 and 10 
represent conscious and legitimate and arguable design decisions. 
To fans of the PDP-6 and 10, here are the 360's main drawbacks: 
NO INDIRECT ADDRESSING. This was because, within the ad­
dressing scheme adopted, indirect addresses could not be adjusted 
automatically. (But it also makes programs more inefficient, 
thus more profitable to IBM.) 
NO STACK. Why? Too expensive, said Amdahl, Blaauw and 
Brooks in tha IBM Systems Journal. Funny, they have stacks on 
IS000 PDP-IU-—nj' it would have saved everybody a lot of 
money on programming. 
NO MEMORY MAPPING (axcapt on certain models). Where the 
PDP-6's successor, the PDP-10, automatically takes care of re­
distributing addresses in core to service evory program •> if 
it were operating from location zero on up, the 360 left this 
general problem to local programmers and (on certain levels) to 
operating systems. 
Handling this automatically in the PDP-10's hardware ob­
viates the complications of base-index addressing and make* pos­
sible the efficiencies of indirect addressing. 
And Amdahl, no longer with IBM and now head of the Amdahl 
Corp. Is coming down the pike with a super-360 of his own, in 
Eart backed by Japanese money. It will be bigger lhan IBM's 
iggast-- and cheaper. (See Hesh Wiener, "Outdoing IBM: th* 
Amdahl Challenge," Computer Decisions. March 73, 18-20.) However, • memory much slower than the main registers, a trick 
is used: program instructions arc drawn from 
core into a superfast instruction list 'often 
called a cache). and any jumps or loops with­
in this seven-word cache can be executed at 
unthinkable speeds-- perhaps tens of millions 
of times per second.

referred to as "the classic Line," was perhaps 
the first minicomputer. It was an important 
forerunner of our highly interactive systems of 
today, notably including today's graphic dis­
plays with double program followers (see p. 
ahT,^ ), which offer the highest interactive 
Perhaps most importantly, it was designed 
with none of the biases that creep in from the 
traditions of business computing. 
It was called the Line because it was 
designed at Lincoln Laboratories (about 1960), 
for "biomedical research"-- actually it was 
the sort of computer you'd warl for hooking 
up to all sorts of inputs and o-tputs, to 
make music, to run your darkroom, but only 
medical scientists could afford it, so that's 
what they said it was for. 
The LINC had two interesting 
It was probably the first computer to be des­
igned with a built-in CRT display (see flip 
side). It also came with a funny little tape 
drive, designed for reliability and high res­
ponse, that was supposed to perform almost as 
conveniently as a disk and be reliable even 
in dusty or messy environments. This was the 
LINCtape, still offered as an accessory by 
company. DEC adapted it somewhat and made 
the DECtape, handy pocket tape unit of the 
computer line. PDP

DEC was offered the option of b 
Lincoln Laboratories' classic LINC, 
ded instead to combine it, in the mid-sixties, 
with the already-successful PDP-S. That way 
a!] the PDP-8 programs and most of the LINC 
programs would work on it. The result is kind 
cf strange, but very popular in biomedical re­
search: two computers in one, handing control 
back and forth as needed. You can write pro­
grams on the Line with sections for the 8, and 
vice versa. Hmm. A more recent and slicker 
called the PDP-12. 
While you might half-think that both 
sides of the computer could work simultaneously, 
giving you double speed, it doesn't work that 
way. There's only one core memory, and that 
sets the basic speed; cither a PDP-8 instruc­
tion or a Line instruction can be underway at 
once, but not both. 
Nevertheless, we see here the double 
structure that plays such an important part 
in highly interactive computer displays (see 
P- £)*XT> ). Indeed, Line programmers often 
use the machine just that way: the PDP-8 run­
ning an actual program, the Line part running 
the CRT display in conjunction with it.

mental monkey sitting on a POP-12 and making

Here, then, are some thumbnail descrip­
tions of some great, classic or popular com­
puters, expanding OUT basic diagrams as needed. 
Individual computers represent variations 
of the patterns shown so far. 
The particular structure of registers, 
memories and pathways among them is called the 
architecture of a computer (see p. 02, ). The 
binary instructions available to the program­
mer are called the instruction-set of the 
particular computer (see p,J3). (The word 
"architecture" is oftenuscd to cover both, 
including the instruction-set as well.) 
The principal variations among computers 
are the word length (in bits-- see "binary 
patterns," anti tne number and arrange­
ment of main registers. Then come the details 
of the instruction-set, especially the ways 
in which items are selected from core memory 
-- the addressing structure. Then the instruc­
tion-set, whose complications and subtleties 
can be considerable indeed. 
The individual computer is the complex 
result of all of these. If they fit together 
well, it is a good design. If they fit to 
gether poorly, it is a bad design. A bad de­
sign is usually not so much a matter of overt 
stinky features as of ramifications which fit 
together disappointingly. (Glitch is a term 
often used for such stinky features or rela­
tionships .) 
The possible ways of organizing computing 
hardware are vast, and only partly explored, 
(An aside to computer guys: on the Intel chip 
debugging consoles they have an address trap 
(trapping on a presettable effective address) 
and a pass counter (trapping after n passes). 
How come we haven't seen these sooner?) 
The machines mentioned here are an arbi­
trary selection. Some of them are the Great 
Numbers, computers so important that folks use 
their numbers as proper nouns, with no brand 
name:

The IBM 7090 was the classic computer. 
Introduced about 196O and mostly gorfo by '66, 
it was simple and powerful, with clean and 
decent instructions. With its daughter the 
70941 it became virtually standard at uni­
versities, research institutions and scien­
tific establishments. At many installations 
that went on to 360s they long for those 
clearminded days. 
The 90 had three index registers and 
fifteen bits to specify core addresses. 
(This meant, of course, that core memory 
could ordinarily be no longer than 32,768 
words ("32Kn— see "Binary patterns," p.'J'J.) 
A later model, the 94, went up to 7 index 
registers, since there were three bits to 
select them with. 
Though these were million-dollar ma­
chines ten years ago, you now hear of them 
being offered free to anyone who'll cart 
them away; partly because they needed a lot 
of power, airconditioning and oso on. But 
they were great number crunchers. (if you 
want a 90, I believe that 90 lookalikes are 
still available from Standard Machines in 
California.) 
Univac's 1106 and 1108 are fast, highly 
regarded machines. In designing the computer 
Univac did a clever thing: they built an up­
graded 7094. This meant (as I understand it) 
that all the programs from the old 7094 will 
run on it. But instead of two main registers 
they have 28. 
(Where they found the bits in the instruc­
tion word to select among all those registers 
I can't tell you.) 
The 1108 is a larger version, with twice 
as marly main registers. DEC's PDP-10 is in some ways the 
computer that the IBM 7094 was in the 
The PDP-10 is excellent for making highly interactive 
systems, since it can respond to every input character 
typed by the user. 
It is a favorite big computer among research people 
and the well-informed. The ARPANET, which connects bia 
computers at some of the hottest research establishments 
is largely built with PDP-lOs. There are PDP-lOs at MIT ' 
U. of Utah, Stanford, Yale, Princeton and Engelbart's snon 
(see p. Jnu-fc). The -Watkins Box (see p.»ny>) hooks to a 10. 
Digital Equipment Corporation, aware that its computer 
trademark PDP" connotes minicomputers to the uninformed 
now wants the 10 to be called DECsystern-1Q rather than PDP 
We'll see if that catches on. 
Who designed it is not entirely clear. I've heard 
people attribute it variously to the Model Railroading Club 
at MIT, to Gordon Bell, and one Alan Kotok. 
Originally it was the PDP-6, which appeared about 1964 
and was the first computer to be supplied with a time-sharing 
system, which worked from the beginning, if rockily. Now 
it's good and solid. DEC'S operating system for it (see p 
45) is called TOPS, but BBN sells one called TENEX, also 
highly regarded. The 10 does time-sharing, real-time pro­
gramming and batch processing simultaneously, swapping to 
changeable areas of core memory. (This feature should soon 
be available, at last, on IBM computers ("VS2-2").) 
PDP-10 time-sharing works even if you don't have a disk, 
using DECtape (DEC's cute little tapes). Of course, without 
disk it's really hobbling, but this capacity is nevertheless 
noteworthy. 
The PDP-10 has debugging commands which work under time­
sharing and with all languages, and hugely simplify program­
ming. 
Unlike the IBM 360, whose hardware protection comes in 
options, the 10 has seven levels of protection: the user can 
specify who may road his files, run them, change them, and do 
four other things. The PDP-10 does have job control commands, 
but they are not even comparable in cumberosity to IBM's JCL 
Language (see p. 31), and they are the same for all three 
modes of operation: time-sharing, real-time and batch.

The PDP-10 has 36 bits but has instructions to operate 
on chunks, or bytes, of any length. It has sixteen main reg­
isters, as does the 360, but uses them more efficiently. 
The PDP-10 also has unlimited indirect addressing: an 
instruction can take its effective address from another lo­
cation, which can in turn say to take its effective address 
elsewhere, ad infinitum. For your heavy tight elegant stuff. 
Perhaps most important, the 10 has a full set of stack 
instructions (see "The Magic of the Stack," p. 42), allowing 
programmers to use multiple stacks for purposes of their own. 
(The operating system's own stacks are protected.) 
mers do not have to save each other's registers, as on the 360. 
Programmers are relatively safe from each other. 
Some think of the PDP-6 and 10 as a glorified 7094 (with 
18 addressing bits, instead of 15). In this case we might 
consider the 360 a stripped-down version of the 6, since IBM 
threw out the stack and in most models the memory napping. 
PDP-lOs are ordinarily sold where the views of scientists 
and engineers are considered important, and comptrollers do 
not have first choice. Nevertheless, some say that its busi-
ness-programming facilities (i.e., COBOL, duh) are just as good 
as those of companies who claim to have designed computers tor 
all purposes." First National City Bank of New York has found 
that the PUP-10 makes a splendid banking computer for internal 
use, profitable at an internal charge of $3.75 an hour plus 
processing charges. Prices for a PDP-10 system with disk start 
start about JS00.OO0, or (15 grand a month, and go up into 'he 
millions. 
However, DEC salesmen are not like IBM's, who can reputed­
ly sell Eskimos to iceboxes. For one thing, DEC salesmen are 
on salary. That fits DEC'S demure, aw-shucks image, but it 
doesn't exactly sell big computers. 
(For you Firesign Theater fans, the mutterings of the 
dying computer on the "Bozos" album are various PDP-10 system 
thingies, artistically juxtaposed.)

For that reason some big computers,

Big computers can have multiple 
program followers and sets of regis­
ters (a program follower and its 
?ml.n re*isters are together called a 
CPU, Central Processing Unit) A 
computer with two CPUs, i.'e., two 
sets of program followers and regis­
ters to carry the programa6ut, is 
called a dual processor; a computer 
with more than two CPUs is called a 
multi-processor. 
Separate independent sections of 
core memory may be put in one computer, 
allowing separate program followers 
and data channels to work at the sane 
time. (Note: a "bank" of core memory 
is an independent section. Except in 
this sense of "core memory bank" or 
"core bank," there is no other correct 
usage of the layman's vague term 
"memory bank." Computer people only 
say "memories," and distinguish fur­
ther among core, disk, tape, etc. 
Note that "data banks" are a separate 
issue-- see "Issues," p.J"?.) 
DINOSAURS? 
Many computer people, the author 
included, entertain certain doubts a-
bout the long-term usefulness of big 
computers, since minicomputers are 
cheaper, especially in the long run, 
and can actually be in the offices and 
homes where people create and use the 
information. Big computers are neces­
sary for time-sharing (see p. 45) and 
huge "number-crunching" jobs (see 
"Grosch's Law," nearby). However, it 
will soon be cheaper to put standard­
ized number-crunching jobs in stand­
alone or accessory hardware; see "Mi­
croprocessors," p. i)^. 
Fans of big computers also argue 
that they are necessary for business 
programming, but that only means tra-
ditional business programming-- non-
interactive and batch-oriented. For 
tomorrow's friendly and clear business 
systems, networks of minis may be pref­
erable. But makers of big computers 
may be unwilling to admit this possi­
bility. 
Tend* to happen several times e day. 
Glow's W 
Minicomputers are ao nifty that we may ask 
why have big computers at all. The answer is 
that there arc considerable economies, especially 
in applications that require many repetitive oper­
ations and don't need interaction with users. 
A hypothesis about the economy of big 
computers waa formulated a long time ago by 
Herbert J.R. Grosch, onetime director of IBM's 
Watson Lab und now a heovy detractor of IBM. 
Thus it is called Grosch's Law. The idea is 
basically that there is a square-law relationahip 
between a machine's size and its power (narrowly 
defined in terms of the coat of millions of operations, 
and without considering the edvantsges of interactive 
systems or other features which may be of more 
ultimate value). Anyway, when I asked him recently 
for his formulation of Grosch's Law. 1 got the fol­
lowing: 
"Grosch's Law (formal): Economy in computing ia as the 
square root of the speed. 
(informal): If you want to do it ten limes 
as cheap, you have to do it a hundred times 
as fast. 
(interpretive): No matter how clever the 
hardware boys are. the software boys piss it away!

-BIGGIE 
The operator muses at the console of the main computer at the University 
of Illinois at Chicago Circle. It is an IBM 370 model 159, which rents for 
about $50,000 a month, including all accessories and a dozen or so terminals 
-- in the parlance of big-computer people, a "medium-sized installation." 
This is a big computer. 
In principle it's no different from a small one; but it has 
bigger memories, more registers, more program followers. There 
are more specialized parts, and more things happening at once. 
(Thus the term "digital computer complex" is sometimes used for 
a big computer.) It comes supplied with a monitor program or 
operating system (see p. 45) and a variety of other utility pro­
grams and language processors. 
Biggies have many ominous and seemingly incomprehensible 
things to scare the layman. 
For one thing, where is the computer? All you see is a lot 
of roaring cabinets. WhicTPis it? 
Answer: all of them. "The computer" is divided among the 
different cabinets (note diagram and cluster of pictures locating 
the operator among them, below).. The external devices or peri­
pherals (see p. S"7) are usually in separate housings. Usually 
there is one single box or "mainframe" containing core memory, 
main registers, program-following circuitry, etc., as in the ma­
chine illustrated, but these things don't have to be in one box, 
and sometimes aren't. Operator's console of 
this particular setup.

Why are the different parts so 
far apart? So there's room to swing

down and repair them. Refrigerators 
could, and perhaps should, also be 
built in separate sections, but it's 
not traditional. Automobiles can't 
be spread out because they have to en­
dure the jostles of the road. But 
computers like this baby aren't going 
anywhere.

that you have to step up as you enter 
a computer room. ~TnatTs because com­
puter rooms ordinarily have raised 
floors, permitting cables to be run 
around among the pieces of equipment 
without your tripping. 
Computer rooms are generally lit 
by millions of fluorescent bulbs, 
making them garishly bright. This is 
simply tradition. 
Big computers can have millions 
of words of core memory. Moreover, 
there are usually several disk drives 
and tape drives, as seen in the pic­
tures, used to hold data and programs. 
(Some of the programs are the system 
programs, especially the language pro­
cessors and the operating system--
see p. tfS-- but other programs and 
most of the data belong to the users.) 
AN OPERATOR IS NOT A PROGRAMMER 
Cindy Woelfer is the day-shift operator of Circle's big computer. 
The job mainly consists of changing disks and tapes, starting and stop­
ping different jobs listed on the scope, and restarting the computer 
when the system crashes (gratuitously ceases operation). 
Ms. Woelfer, a thoughtful person, says she does not find her job 
very stimulating. She can program, but the job doesn't involve pro-
granming. It's also a lonely job. Non-systems people, except Mayor 
Daley, aren't ordinarily allowed around. About the only people to talk 
to are the systems programmers who stop through to look at the scope 
and see whether their programs are up next.

^ MINI 
This is a PDP-11, one of the world's beet-designed minicomputers (see p. YZJJ • 
The PDP-11 is a 16-bit machine. Shown is Model 45, the fastest PDP-11, which 
has various special features. Stripped, with 4K of core memory (that's 4096 
locations), it costs about $13 grand. A smaller PDP-11 goes for some $5000. 
A minicomputer simply means a 
small computer, no different in 
principle from the big ones (see 
next spread), and it can do all the 
same things except as limited by 
speed and memory capacity. 
(Mind, we are talking about 
real computers, not the little cal­
culators you hold in your hand that 
just do arithmetic. A real compu­
ter is one which works on stored 
programs and all kinds of data, 
working not merely on numbers but 
on such other things as text, mu­
sic and pictures if supplied with 
appropriate programs; see flip side.) 
There is some argument over 
what constitutes a minicomputer; 
basically we will say it's any com­
puter with a word length of.18 bits 
or less (see "Binary Patterns," p. 
2-7). (Some companies, like Data-
craft and Interdata, are trying to 
peddle their worthy computers as 
"minicomputers" even though they're 
24 and 32 bits, respectively, but 
that's very odd. Interdata says 
any computer under ten thousand is 
a mini-- which means all computers 
will be minis by and by; a vexing 
thing to do to the term.) 
Traditionally minicomputers 
come with much less. In the old 
days pretty much all the programs 
you got with it were an assembler 
(see p. ys) and a debugger (see p. 
Jo) and a Fortran compiler (see p. 
2D if you were lucky. Today, 
though, with minis having highly 
built-up software like (see pp.io-t/? 
for descriptions) the PDP-8, the 
PDP-11 and the Nova, you can get a 
lot of different assemblers, to­
gether with Fortran, BASIC, and a 
little disk or cassette operating 
system (see p. H&) to make your 
life a little easier. The idea of owning a computer 
may* seem strange to some people, 
but with prices falling as they are 
it makes perfect sense. Numerous 
individuals own minis, and as the 
price continues to drop the number 
will shoot up. For several families 
with children to pool together and 
buy one for the kids makes a lot of 
sense. One friend of mine has an 8, 
another is contemplating an 11. 
(I've been trying to get my own for 
years; perhaps this book...) Any­
how, the general price range is now 
$3000 to $6000 plus accessories, 
and that's dropping fast. Rental 
is usually a great mis take: prices 
are very high and after six months 
or so you'll have paid for it with­
out owning it. (But names of rental 
places will be found in this book, 
and some of-thera may offer good ar­
rangements.) Minis may now be had 
in quantity for $1000 each-- price 
of the PDP-8A in May 1974-- and soon 
that will be the consumer price. 
Unfortunately, the price of the 
computer itself is dropping faster 
than that of the accessories, such 
as the basic terminal you'll need, 
which still weighs in at $1000-5000. 
Moreover, as soon as you want to do 
anything serious you'11 need a disk 
(starting around $4500) or at least 
a cassette memory (starting around 
$1500). But these prices too will 
come way down as the consumer market 
opens. 
Some of us minicomputer freaks 
see little real need for big computers. 
Minicomputers are splendid for inter­
active and "good-guy" systerns (see 
P* 13)» as personal machines, to han­
dle typing and bookkeeping; even for 
business systerns, if you recognize 
the value of working out your own in 
BASIC or, say, TRAC Language. 
Minicomputers are being put in­
side all manner of other equipment 
to handle complex control. (However, 
for repetitive simple tasks, the lat­
est thing is microprocessors (see p. 
If), which cost less but are harder 
to program.) Minicomputers are now being found 
in highschools; active marketing to 
highschools is now being done by both 
DEC and Hewlett-Packard. 
Children's museums in Brooklyn 
and Boston have recently obtained PDP-
lls for the kids to interact with. In 
the Brooklyn case, the computer will 
even demonstrate the exhibit and help 
the child discover things about it, in 
ways worked out by Gordon Pask fsee D 
In the future, networks of minis 
may be the systems to offer low-cost 
information services to the home (for 
speculations, see P. 1>V\ £7). 
But minis will also start to make big­
ger and bigger incursions on the terri­
tory of the big machines. For instance, 
one group proposes a time-sharing sys­
tem which will simply consist of Novas 
interconnected in a ring, the so-called 
STAR-RING, which will supposedly com­
pete with big time-sharing. 
Here's that selfsame PDP-11 
in its overall setting. With 
peripherals shown, plus the 
magnificent Vector General 
display (shown later on in 
book, p?*3l& eleewhere), 
this setup cost well over a 
hundred grand. (This is the

Ten minutes after starting to program in 
Machine Language you will probably want Assem­
bly Language. 
It's a pain trying to get ail the ones and 
zeroes right. (£*«> i-A .L, %t 5*«< *.»-y) 
It's a pain trying to keep track of binary 
numbers for where things are stored. 
SO: let's give them alphabetical names. 
That's assembly language. (And the conversion 
program we put our alphabetical into, to turn 
them back inlo Ihe binary patterns that really 
run the machine-- lhat conversion program is 
called the Assembler.) 
An assembler is a direct and non-incky 
translator, intended mainly to handle the details 
of exact transposition between instruction code­
words and the exactly corresponding machine-
language program that you intend. 
IT WORKS LIKE THIS: The assembler 
scans through the assembly - language program, 
testing the successive alphabetical characters. 
After finding the key punctuation marks or 
delimiters (shown as comma and slash for the 
FIDO assembler), it scans for the alphabetical 
Instruction mnemonics, and translates them by 
a table in core memory into the corresponding 
binary codes. (Il ignores everything on a line 
after a slash , which is lucky, since in the 
comments you may use words which are the same 
as instruction mnemonics.) 
The assembler also counts the in st ruction a, 
and (starting wherever you say) figures where 
in core memory the instructions (and any data 
or spaces you put in) go. Then it makes a list 
of these addresses, called a symbol table (also 
called a name Hal at less elegant places). 
An assembler is the simplest form of 
compiler (see p.30). Basically it translates an 
aaaembly-language program, which cannot be run 
directly, inlo a binary program which can. 
Then from this symbol table it fills Ihe 
resulting binary addresses into the binary com­
mands of the program. 
m't you glad you don'l have to? 
Generally the assembler then sends out 
the binary program to some external device, 
such as a disk memory or paper tape punch. 
Then it can be put into core memory when you 
want to run it. 
(You can put s program into core memory 
one bit al a~tlme through the front-panel switches; 
but nobody likes doing this except for teeny pro­
mote: an aaaembler for one computer (say 
the PDP-8) lhal runs on a different computer 
(say, the 360) is called a cross assembler.)

There is a certain folk hero whom the 
people all call Bucky. It ia said that he wears 
three wrletwatches: one for where he la now, 
one for where he will be next, and one that 
telle whst time it is at his home. 
Well now. Here's sn example of a little 
problem on which to try our FIDO computer. 
Let's wire up a msgic wrlstwatch for 
Bucky the Folk Hero, one that will use a teeny 
FIDO on a chip (the coming- thing), attached to 
three rows of numerical readouts flike those 
on pocket calculators). 
Thia application Is not so absurd aa you 
might think. 
It la obvloualy quite simple in principle. 
It will let us see some of the ways that 
the rock-bottom machine langusges or computers 
are used. 
Naturally this got saved for last, and 
what is presented here shows it. 
The example was meant to be a case of 
not-very-numerical programming that would 
ahow the abstract ness of it all. The program 
Itself has no intrinsic quality related to the 
problem; thai much should be visible. 
Anyhow, I programmed this myself a few 
weeks ago In the FIDO language, and was very 
pleased with it, but then discovered a couple 
of appalling bugs. As time closed in on this 
project 1 asked my friend Mike O'Brien to code 
the program, and he kindly consented, taking 
time out of his previous weekend plans. Here 
is Mike's program, for which I am grateful. 
HowEVer, after it waa set in type, Mike 
realized that lt too has some gross flaws and 
would not work as here presented. We thought 
of having a chocolate chip cookie contest for 
corrections, sending out chocolate chip cookies 
to entrants fixing it up, but we don't have 
such a computer and we wouldn't run the pro­
gram if we had one anyway, so see if you can 
get the basic'idea of it, snd if you are a real 
wise guy fix the program for your own satis­
faction, and that will be that. 
The basic idea is that we have a FIDO, 
presumably on a single integrated circuit chip, 
attached to thirteen external devices (or periph­
erals, or input-output devices, or I/O devices 
or whatever). These devices are a timer or 
clock, which reaches zero once per minute--
thls is a computer clock, meaning a timer, not 
something that people can read-- and the three 
rows of numerical readouts that are the desired 
Superwatch. 
For simplicity's sake we assume here that 
each numeral is interfaced to do either input or 
output; thus the FIDO computer can aak any 
given numeral what it says, and change its con­
tents. 
The finished Wriatwatch ia going to give 
time on a twenty four-hour baaia. not twelve, like 
at NASA and suchlike places. After 12: 59 comes 
13:00. After 23:59 comes 01:00. 
The bulk of the program is occupied with 
testing the numerala and changing them. How­
ever, in proportions of activity, the poor thing 
ia going to spend moat of its time Baying, "Is 
it time yet? Is it time yet? Is it time yet?" 
(That's the second, third and fourth instruction.) 
Because the FIDO selects the particular 
input-output device with the last seven bits of 
an input or output instruction, this has been 
done with "address modification" arithmetic: 
creating an output instruction to address a par­
ticular device by adding the Inst ruction to the 
"*"» °I »« device. Thia ia an ancient snd" 
honorable programming trick. 
In several cases, the program chooses a 
device to examine, or fill, by taking a blank 
input or output instruction (kept at locations 
X OXO XOX and X OXO XXO, reapectively) and 
*dd" '« the AC, to a counting number that 
la being used to step around In the array of 
numerala. (Thia counting number is "N," 
alored in location X OXO XXX.) (Theae instruc­
tions were put into the slots in octal form, ss 
"6»MB" and "62MB" respectively. The al ashes 
sre meant lo distinguish &eroea from Ohs. The 
*B" at the end (in the assembly Hating) means 
that the assembler ia supposed io translate these

when it finds the timer has reached zero, is. 
testing whether the rightmost digit is a nine. 
(It only has to test one, since minutes are the 
same round the world.) If it's not nine, il 
just adds one to each— a part of ihe program 
called ADMIN, starting at XXO OXO. If it's 
nine, however, il sets the final digits all to 
zero, end then testa the tens digit to aee if it's 
a five, meaning the end of an, hour. (The num­
ber five has been Ingenuously stored in a loca­
tion which Mike has called FIVE, which assem­
bled lo slot number X OXO OXO. If you look 
there, you will see that the slot does, indeed, 
contain the binary pattern for the number 5.)

(Faithful Instrument. Domesticated and Obliging). 
The FIDO la a twelve-bli machine. The 
main register (It haa only one) la twelve bit* 
long, and every memory slot la twelve bits long. 
Every Instruction ts twelve bits long; 
every data word Is twelve bits long, though of 
course much longer pieces of data can be put 
together by taking more than one twelve-bit 
Some rudimentary instructions of the FIDO 
are listed In a nearby box. The instruction* of 
the FIDO are of two type*: plain onea that Just 
use the main register (like CLEAR), and the 
divided one*, which select a memory alot or 
output device. On the FIDO theae are divided 
Into an operation code (opcode) of five blia--
the bits that tell the program follower what the 
operation ia to be: and an address of seven 
bits, specifying which memory alot (or external 
device) 1* to be operated on. 
These seven bili allow exactly 128 differ­
ent patterns. (from OOOOOOO to XXXXXXX), 
which means we can select among exactly 12B 
different memory slot*. (See Binary Patterns. 
p.->S.) (HJ».)

and switches; the row of lights can ahow the 
contents of any specific working register or

This is a common test instruction,

of the AC are compared with the specified 
core memory location, tf they are not the 
same, the program continuea and lakes the 
next instruction in Ihe normal fashion. IF 
the two patterns are Ihe same, the pro­
gram follower SKIPS the next instruction

An occult aspect of computer design la the 
matter of how lo pack into the so-many bits of 
an instruction word all the option, th. programmer 
should have. 
ft For no particular reason ths instruction 
•elect bit* are usually on the left, the address

them in thia book, unfortunately) In the middle.

Ihe programmer can choose among, 15 bits in 
the address means s choice of 12.768 memory lo­
cations. 7 bita mean* • choice of only 128 
(See "Binary Patterns," p. 33 .) 
Deciding whal the instruction layouts are 
lo be hinges on the architectural design of the 
computer (see p.3*. ) and the ins<ruction-set. 
It all gets worked out together. 
It's ultimately a matter of design elegance, 
but the consequences sre very concrete. An 
elegant instruction-set Is easy to use and there­
fore aaves a lot of time and money. (Anyone 
interested in studying the matter might want lo 
compare the PDP-11, a 18-bit computer with a 
brilliantly designed inatructlon-set. with some 
other 16-bil computer.) 
The FIDO is nothing but a stripped-down 
rsion of that beloved family pooch of computerdom, 
It PDP-?-

If you buy s PDP-8 from Digital Equipment 
Corporation, you get all this and more. (Except

Every computer ia wired to accept a spe­
cific ayatem of commands. When theae commands 
•re atored in the computer's memory, and the 
computer'? program follower gels lo them, they 
cauee it to respond directly by electronic reflex. 
Thia is called nusohln* laaMfusfjs. the very lan­
guage of the machine Itself 
In most available computers the machine 
languages »™ binary, meaning composed of only 
two eltemstive symbols. Binary because it's a 
sensible way of organizing the machine's struc­
ture; It permits programs to be reduced to a 
•ingle common form of information, and permits 
programs to be stored in binary memory. Each 
individual instruction or command ordinarily 
occupies one memory slot, though some compu­
ters have commands of varying length. 
Different computers have different machine 
languages, but the Inatructiona of all computers 
are basically aimilar. Big computera have more 
commands, with more variations, and carry 
them oul faster; bul those variations are lust 
extra ways of saving atepa. not qualitatively 
different features. 
These deep-down operations ARE ALL THE 
THINGS THE COMPUTER EVER DOES. However, 
in their combinations these instructions can be 
woven Into chains and diadems of complex actiona. 
ALL COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE EVEN­
TUALLY WRITTEN OR ENACTED IN THE MACHINE'S 
PARTICULAR BINARY LANGUAGE . 
Now, it ia entirely poe«ible to write your 
programs at thia level, considering and arran­
ging rock-bottom commands. Thia is called 
machine-language programming (and assembly 
programming; aee examples a little later on). 
Indeed, working at thia level ia very highly 
respected in aome quarters. Others avoid it. 
Thia l« a very aerioue matter of teats and what 
you're working on. 
Higher-level languages. seen on earlier 
pages, have more convenient forms for people, 
but must be translated, either ahead of time or 
on • running basis, to the bottom-most codes 
that make things happen in the machine. All of 
them are built out of machine language. Writ­
ing the language processors, programs that 
enact or translate theae higher-level languages, 
is considered a black art. (See p.J*.) 
Every programmable device haa a "machine 
language," or rock bottom code aystem that acti-
vatea the thing directly; ite program follower 
responds electrically to these codea. and enacta 
them one instruction at a time. 
True computera are programmable devlcea 
thai can modify their own i nat ruction a, change 
their sequence of operations and do other versa­
tile stuff. (>^U^r^kcHITEtT^

Computera are baalcally alike. Ignore their 
appearances: a roomful of roaring cabinets may 
have a great deal in common with • small blinking 
box; indeed, they may have the same architecture, 
or atructure. and therefore be the same computer. 
The atructure of computers, in their glorious 
similarities and fascinating differences, ia called 
computer architecture. 
(For the architecture of a beginner's com­
puter, see p.S*; for the architecture of aome 
famous computers, eee^p.'jo-} .) 
Computer architecture covera three main 
things: registers (places where something happens 
to information); memories (places where nothing 
happens to information): their interconnections; 
and machine language, all the bottom-level instruc­
tions (for this last see "Rock Bottom," p. 32,). 
REGISTERS AND MEMORIES 
Computers are made, basically, of two 
things', registers snd memories. A register is 
where something happens to information; a memory 
la where nothing happens to information. Let'a 
go over that alowly. 
A register is a place where something 
happens to information: the Information can be 
flipped around, tested, changed by arithmetic, 
or whatever. (We noted earlier that registers 
are what connect a computer to its accessories. 
They are also principal parts of the computer 
Itself.) 
A memory is a place where nothing hap-
pena to information. A program puts the infor­
mation there, and there it stays till some pro­
gram pulls it out again or replaces it, 
A main or general register (often called 
ths accumulator, for no good reason) is where 
the program brings things to be worked on, 
tested, compared, added to and so on. There 
can be several of them in a computer. 
Other registers perform other functions in 
the computer; a given computer's design, or archi-
techture, is largely the arrangement of registers 
and the operations that take place between them. 
The reason we don't just have all registers--
and no memories at all-- ia that registers tradi­
tionally cost more than memories. (However, some 
machines are being tried that have all working 
registers instead of memory. See STARAN, p.43.) 
Memories come in all sizes and speeds. 
So lots of computers have big alow memories, 
such as disk memories, along with their small 
fast r THE ROCK BOTTOM PROGRAM FOLLOWER 
How, you ask desperately, does thla inner­
most program follower work? The on* that ia 
built into the computer? 
A memory consists of numerous holding 
places or storage locations, each holding one 
standard piece of information for the computer, 
e word having a specific number of bits (see p. 
.) We muat stress: a "COMPUTER WORD" 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ENGLISH WORDS OR 
ALPHABETICAL CHARACTERS. The term refera 
to a specific machine's standard memory slot, 
having a fixed number of bit positions. 
One important reason for this standardiza­
tion is that each holding place, or memory loca­
tion, can be given a number or address. If 
every slot in the memory has an address, infor­
mation can be stored in specific places: and gotten back out of specific places: 
A core memory has a definite rhythm or 
cycle, into which It divides the passing time. 
The memory cycle of a core memory ia so im­
portant that Its duration is often called the 
cycle time of the A request to the core 
memory made at the beginning of the cycle 
is honored at the end of the cycle. Core cycles 
are very fast, being theae days about one 
microsecond, or millionth of a second. 
A core memory can only perform one act 
(store or fetch) during one memory cycle. 
One last point about core memories. The 
number which speciSes an address to the mem­
ory is a binary pattern-- lust like all the other 
information (see "Binary Patterns," p. ). 
(Or more exactly, whatever binary pattern is sup-
piled lo the memory as the address to store or 
from which to fetch, that pattern will be treated 
as the address to store or from which to fetch, 
that pattern will be treated aa a binary number 
whether it was supposed to be or not. It could 
be the alphabetic word GRINCH which got there 
by mistake (aee "Debugging," p. JJO ), but the 
memory will treat it as an address number and go 
to the address specified by that pattern. 
The word length 
(number of bit-spaces in a main 
register and memory slot) 
The number of main registers 
and what they can do; i.e., how 
they are set up and what operationa 
can take place in and among them; 
i.e., 
the Instruction Set (see nearby); 
The amount of memory; 
The accessories or peripherals; 
The cycle time. 
Here's the computer, then, in all its glory: 
s device with a symbolic program, stored in a 
memory, being stepped through by s program 
follower. 
The commands of the program cauae the 
program follower to carry out the individual 
steps requested by each command of the program. Aha. 
Basically it consists of two specific regis­
ters, tha Program Counter (usually sbbreviated 
PC) and th* Instruction Register (usually abbre­
viated IR), and other electronic a tuff, loosaly 
termed "decoding logic." 
(Since we are already visualizing the 
program follower aa a little hand, let's think of 
the index finger as the program counter and 
imagine that the thumb can flip an Instruction 
into a little cup, the Instruction Register or IR 
What the heck.) 
WHEN s program is set into operation, the 
binary pattern specifying Its first address In 
memory la put Into the program counter. 
Then the instruction at that address 1* 
fetched to the program follower (that is, put in 
the Instruction register), decoded and carried 
THEN THE PROGRAM COUNTER AUTOMAT­
ICALLY HAS ONE ADDED TO IT, SO IT POINTS 
TO THE NEXT INSTRUCTION . 
The instruction pulled from memory is 
held In the command or instruction register 
and there decoded by the system's electronics. 
It ia of no concern to the programmer how 
Ihis Is done electronically. (And indeed elec­
tronics is generally of little concern to computer 
people, unless they are trying to design or op­
timize computers or other devices themselves. 
Indeed, the electronic techniques are constantly 
changing.) 
All we need to know is that an electrical 
decoding ayatem (called the logic circuits) carries 
out the specific instruction-- for instance, by 
shutting off the path to the memory, turning on 
the adding circuit, and opening paths through 
the adding circuit and beck to the main register. 
Now that the program counter holds tha 
number of the next instruction it in turn Is 
accordingly fetched and executed. 
When an instruction calls for a jump or 
branch in the program, what happens? 
The Jump command causes a new number 
to be stuffed into the program counter, that's 
what, and ao that's where the program goes next. 
ALTERNATING CYCLES 
Many Instructions tell the program follower 
to take a data word (also a binary pattern) from 
memory and put lt in a main register or vice 
Such an Instruction is translated by the 
decoding logic into a request to the memory. 
Since a core memory can only do one 
thing during one of ita cycles, the next instruc­
tion In the program cannot be fetched until the 
data haa moved to or from the memory. 
Thus in many types of program the cycles

A certain number of computer languages 
sre very widely accepted and used; 1 list them 
here. If you wsnt to learn any of them, I believe 
that Dsniel McCrscken has written a manual on 
every one of them. (Not the variants listed, 
though.) 
Why their namea are always spelled with 
capital letters I don't know. (Generally they 
get let down in longer articles, though.) 
FORTRAN wsa crested in the late fifties, 
largely by John BackuB, ae sn algebraic pro­
gramming syatem for the old IBM 704. fflowever, 
the usual story is thst it stands for "FORmula 
TRANslator.) 
Fortrsn is "algebraic," thst is, it uses 
an algebraic sort of notation and was mostly 
suited, in the beginning, to writing programs 
that carried out the sorts of formulas that you 
use in highschcol algebra. It's Btrong on num­
bers carried to a lot of decimal places ("scientific" 
numbers) snd the handling of arrays, which Is 
something else mathematicians and engineers do 
a lot (see Arrays under BASIC). 
Fortran has grown and grown, however; 
after Fortran 1 came Fortran II, Fortran III and 
Fortrsn IV; as well ss a lot of variants like 
Fortran Pi ("irrational, and somewhere between 
HI and IV"), WAT FOR and WATFIV. 
The larger Fortrsns-- thst is, language 
processors that run on the bigger computers--
now have many operations not contemplated in 
the original Fortran, including operations for 
handling text and so on. 
BASIC, presented earlier, is in some res­
pects a simplified version of Fortran. This program uas a surprise from 
Alan Nslles, a student at Chicago 
Circle. Be wae amused by my praa-
tias of alphabetising phone num­
bers, and wrote a program to do it 
automatically. 
Premises of tha program: you sup­
ply it -jith your phone number, and 
it prints out all the alphabetical 
combinations that could also be 
dialled to reach your telephone.

Behold ecne of the combinations. The reaipient picks out the one he likes from pages of them. 
ALGOL is considered by many to be 
one of the best "scientific" languages; it has 
been widely accepted in Europe, and is the 
standard "publication language" in which procedures 
for doing things are published in this country. 
It is different from FORTRAN in many ways, 
but a key respect is this: while in FORTRAN 
the programmer must lay out at the beginning 
of his program exactly what spaces of core 
memory are to have what names, in ALGOL 
the spaces in core memory are not given names 
except within subsections of the program, 
or "procedures." When the program follower 
gets to a specific procedure, then the language 
processor names the spaces in core memory. 
This has several advantages. One ia 
that it can be used for so-called "recursive" 
programa, or programa that call new versions 
of themaelves into operation. I guess we better 
not get into that. But mathematicians like 
Originally this language was called IAL, 
for International Algebraic Language, but then 
as it grew snd got polished by various inter­
national committees it was given its new name. 
0 don't know if anyone consciously named 
it after Algol, the star.) 
It has gone through several versions. 
Algol 62, the publication language, is one 
thing; Algol 70, the 1970 version, is much 
more complicated and strange. 
Several versions of ALGOL have gotten 
popular in this country. One. developed at 
the University of Michigan, ia called MAD 
(Michigan Algorithm Decoder); its symbol is 
of course Alfred E. Newman. Another favorite 
(for its name, anyway) la JOVIAL (Jules' Own 
Version of the International Algebraic Language), 
developed under Jules Schwartz (and supposedly 
named without his consultation) st Syatem Devel­
opment Corporation. 
When IBM announced Ua System 360 back 
in 1964, there had been hope that they would 
support the international language committees 
and make Algol the bssic language of their new 
computer line. No such luck. Instead they 
announced PL/1 (Programming Language I), a 
computer language that was going lo be ail 
things to all man. 
In programming style il resembled COBOL, 
but had faculties for varieties of "scientific" 
numbers and soma good data structure systems, 
lt is available for the 360 and for certain big 
Honey we U computers; indeed, the operating aya­
tem tor MULTICS (see p. 1? ) was written In 
PL/1. Whether there ar* people who love the 
language I don't know; there are certainly 
people who hate It. Below: Relies' program to calculate the date of Easter.

Resesrch snd hobby types hate COBOL or 
ignore it, but it's the main bualness programming 
language. Your income tax. your checking ac­
count, your automobile license— all are presum­
ably handled by programs in the COBOL language. 
COBOL, or COmmon Business Oriented Lan­
guage, was more or lesa demanded by the Depart­
ment of Defense, and brought into being by a 
committee called CODASYL. which is apparently 
still going. COBOL uses mostly decimal numbers, 
is designed basically for batch processing (des­
cribed elsewhere), snd uses verbose and plonking 
command formats. 
Just because it's standard for business 
programming doesn't mean it's the best or most 
efficient language for business programming; 
I've talked to people who advocate bualness pro­
gramming in FORTRAN, BASIC, TRAC and even 
APL. But then you get into those endless argu­
ments... and it turns out thai a large proportion 
of business programmers only know Cobol. which 
pragmatically settles the argument. 
There are people who say they've discovered 
hidden beauties in COBOL; for instance, that it's 
a splendid language for complex pointer manipulation 
(see Data Structures, p. Xie )- That's what makes 
horse racing.

JCL is a language with which you subrait programs 
to an IBH 360 or 370 computer. "Submit" ia right. Its 
complications, which many call unnecessary, symbolise 
the career of submission to IBM upon which th* 360

SNOBOL is the favorite computing language 
of a lot of my friends. It is a list-processing 
language, meaning it's good for amorphous data. 
(It derives from several previous list-processing 
languages, especially IPL-V and COMIT.^ 
SNOBOL is a big language, and only runs 
on big computers. The main concept of it is 
the "pattern match," whereby a string of symbols 
is examined to see if lt has certain characteristics, 
including any particular contents, relations between 
contents, or other variations the programmer can 
specify; and the string substitution, where some 
specified string of symbols is replaced by another 
that the programmer contrives.

intelligence freaks (see .ff* UP • A fondnesas for 
LISP, incidentally, is not considered to reflect 
on your masculinity. 
LISP is a "cult" language, and its adherents 
are sometimes called Lispians. They see computer 
activities in a somewhat different light, as com­
posed of ever-changing chains of things called 
"cars" and "cudders," which will not be explained 
here. 
LISP was developed by John McCarthy at 
BUT, based largely on the Lambda-notation of 
Alonzo Church. It allows the chaining of oper­
ations and data in deeply intermingled forma. 
While it runs on elegant principles, moat people 
object to its innumerable parentheses (a feature 
shared to some extent by TRAC Language). 
Joaeph Weizenbaum, also of MIT, has 
created a language called SLIP, somewhat resem­
bling LISP, which runs in FORTRAN. That means 
you can run LISP-like programa without having 
access to a LISP processor, which is helpful.

and IF you laid out in the spell 
a plan that would effectively 
do what you had in mind. 
BUT if you make a mistake in casting your spell. that is 
a BUG. (As you see from the IFs aLove, many types of 
bug are possible.) Program bugs can cause unfortunate 
results. (Supposedly a big NA'iA rocket failed in takeoff 
once because of a misplaced dollar in a program.) 
Getting the bug* out of a program is celled debugging. 
It's very hard. 
DESIGNING COMPUTER LANGUAGES 
Every programmer who's designed a language, and 
created a processor for it. had certain typical uses in mind. 
If you want to create your own Innguagc, you figure out 
what aorta of operations you would like to have be basic 
in it, and how you would like it all lo fit together so as 
to allow the variations you have in mind. Then you program 
your processor (which ia usually very hnrd) . fj C0«A»;|e> tt\s ^ Basically there are two different methods . 
A compiling language, auch as FORTRAN or COBOL. 
i compiler program, which nits in the computer, and 
"source program," the way receives the input progri 
the assembler does. It analyzes the source program and 
substitutes for it an object program, in machine language, 
which is a translation of the source program, and can actually 
be run on the computer. The relation of the higher language 
is not one-to-one to machine language: many instructions 
in machine language are often needed to compile a single 
instruction of the source program . (A source program of 
100 lines can easily come out a thousand lines long in its 
output version.) Moreover , because of the interdependence 
of the instructions in the source program. the compiler 
usually has to check various arrangements all over the 
program before it can generate the final code. 
Most compilers come in several stages. You have 
to put the first stage of the compiler into the computer, 
then run in Ihe source program, and the first stage puts 
out a first intermediate version of the program. Then you 
put this version inlo a second stage, which puts out a second 
intermediate version; and so on through various stages. 
This is done fairly automatically on big computers, but 
on little machines it's a pain. 
(In fact, compilers tend to be very slow programs; 
but that depends on the amount of "optimizing" they do, 
that is, how efficient they try to make the object program.) 
An interpretive language works differently. There 
sits in core a processor for the language called en interpreter; 
this goes through the program one step at a time, actually 
carrying out each operation in the list and going on to the 
next. TRAC and APL are interpretive; it's a good way 
to do quickie languages. 
Interpreters are perhaps the easier method of the 
two to grasp, since they seem to correspond a little better 
to the way many people think of computers. That doesn't 
mean they're better. For programs that have to be run 
over and over, compiling is usually more economical in 
the long run; but for programs that have to be repeatedly 
changed , interpreters are often simpler to work with. 
A BLACK ART 
Making language processors, especially compilers, 
is widely regarded as a black art. Some people have tricks 
that are virtual trademarks (see below) . 
Actually, the design of a language-- especially the 
syntax. how its commands fit logether-- strongly influences 
the design of its processor. BASIC and APL. for instance, 
work left-to-right on esch line, and top-to-bottom on a 
program. Both act on something stored in a work area. 
TRAC, on the other hand, works left-to-right on a text 
string that changes size like a rubber band. Other languages 
exhibit comparable differences. 
MIXED CASES AND VARIATIONS (for the whimsical) 
There are a lot of mixed cases. A load-and-go compiler 
(such as WATFOR) is put into the computer wilh the program, 
compiles it. and then atarts it going immediately. An interpretive 
compiler looks up what to do with a given instruction by in­
terpreting il into a series of steps, but compiling them instead 
of carrying (hem out. (A firm called Digitek is well known 
for making very good compilers of this type.) An incremental 
compiler just runs along compiling a command at a time; 
this can be a lot faster but has drawbacks.

How does a computer program 
print something out an a printing 
machine? tt sends the code for each 
letter out to the printing machine. 
How doea a computer program 
respond to something a user types in? 
It compares the codes that come in 
from the letters he types with a 
series of codes in memory, and when 
it finds a match between letters, 
numbers, words or phrases, brsn-
ches to the corresponding action. 
How does a computer program 
measure something? It lakes in 
numerical codes from a device which 
has already made the measurements 
and converted them to codes. 
DOES NOT COMPUTE! 
Some TV writer's 
idea of a computer 
announces this when 
data are insufficient or 
contradictory. Ho hum. 
Codes are patterns or symbols which 
are assigned meanings. Sometimes we 
make up special codes to cut down the s-
mount of information that has to be stored. 
On your driver's license, for instance, 
they may reduce your hair color to one 
decimal digii (four bits of information), 
since there are less than nine possibilities 
for quick identification of hair-color anyway. 
Obviously, codes can be any dam 
thing: any set of symbols that is less than 
what you started with. But by compressing 
information they lose information, so that 
subtleties disappear (consider the use of 
letters A to F to grade students). When 
you divide a continuum into categories, not 
Just the fewness of the categories, but the 
places you draw the line— called "breaks" 
or "cutting-points"-- present problems. Such 
chopping frequently blurs out important dis-
tinctiona. Coding is always arbitrary, fre­
quently destructive and stupid. 
Lots of waya now exist to handle writ­
ten information by computer. These often 
present better wsys to operate lhan by using 
codes of this type. But many computer pro­
grammers prefer to make you use codes. 
(NOTE: there are two other senses of 
"code" used hereabouts: 1) the binary pat­
terns msde to stand for any information, 
especially on input and output; 2) what 
computer programs consist of, that is, lines 
of commands.) IF yvO WAMT MUtV&tKS,

The basic kinds of number operations 
wired into all computera are few: Just add 
(and sometimes subtract) binary numbers. 
However, up above the minicomputer range, 
a computer may have multiply, divide, and 
more. Fancier computers offer more types 
and operations on them. 
PLAIN BINARY— Very important for coun­
ting. Represents numbers aa 
patterns of l's snd O's (or X's 
and Oha, if you prefer). How 
to handle negative numbers? 
Two waya: 
TRUE NEGATIVE-- binary number 
with a sign bit at the begin­
ning, followed by the number. 
JoMt Points 
"Logical deduction" really consists of tech­
niques for finding out what's already 
in a data structure. 
"Logical inconsistency" means a data 
structure contradicts itself. Rarely 
does it happen that a computer helps 
you discover something new about a 
subject that you didn't auspect or see 
coming without the computer: after 
all, you hsve to set up a study in 
auch a way as to make room to find 
things out, and you can only make 
room to find some things out.

Punch cards are not Intrinsically evil. 
They have served many uaeful purposes. 
Bul the punch-card mentality is still around. 
Thia will be seen in the programmer who 
habitually aels things up so we have to use 
punch cards (when other media, or inter­
active terminals, would be better); who in-
aists on the user or victim putting down 
numbers (when with a Utile more effort the 
program could handle text, which ia easier 
tor the human, or even look up the infor­
mation in data it has already); who Insists 
that people's last names be cut down to 
eleven letters because he doean't feel llk« 
leaving a longer field or handling exception* 
in hi* program; who insist* on the outsider 
cutting hi* information Into anarfy little codes, 
whan such digestion, if nseded al all, could 
be batter don* by tha program; and ao on. 
The punch card mentality is responsible 
tor many of the mow that have been blanked 
on "oonputars." Trouble is, the arithmetic is 
harder to wire for this kind, 
because there are two zeroes 
(plus and minuB) between 1 
and -1. 
ADD ABLE NEGATIVE— this system 
does a sort of flip and begins 
a negative number with all 
ones. It means that the ma­
chine doesn't have to have sub­
traction circuitry: you Just add 
the flipped negative version of 
a number, and that actually 
subtracts it. This has now 
caught on generally. (It's 
usually called "twos complement 
negative," which has some ob­
scure mathematical meaning.] 
BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal)— the accoun­
tant's numbering system. Used by 
COBOL (see p. ^\ ). It's plain old 
decimal, with every numeral stored 
in four bits; the machine or language 
has to add them one numeral at a 
time, instead of crunching together 
full binary words. 
FLOATING POINT-- the scientist's number 
technique for anything that may not 
come out even. Expresses any 
quantity as an amount snd a size. 
The "amount" part contains the ac­
tual binary numerals, the "size" is 
the number of places in front of or 
after the decimal point that the num­
ber starts. Very important for as­
tronomical and infinitesimal matters, 
since a floating-point number can be 
bigger, say, than 
9,676,543,210.000 
or smaller than 
.00000001234567 
For some people even this isn't pre­
cise enough, so they program up 
"Infinite precision arithmetic," which 
carries out arithmetic to as many 
places as they want. It takes much 
longer, though. 
WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN 
MACHINES AND LANGUAGES 
Some machines, like the 360, are 
more-or-less wired up to handle several 
number types: binary, floating point, BCD. 
Little machines usually only have plain bin­
ary, so other types nave to be handled by 
programa built up from that fundamental 
binary. 
Languages make up for this by 
providing programs to hsndle numbers in 
some or all of these formats. There are 
languages that offer even more kinds of 
numbers--
IMAGINARY numbers 
(two-part numbers 
following certain rules) 
QUATERNIONS 
(like Imaginary numbers 
but worse) 
and goodness knows what else. 
On Ihe other hand, aome languages 
restrict what number facilities are avail­
able for simplicity's sake. BASIC, for 
Instance, doesn't distinguish between 
Integers (counting numbers) and those 
with decimal points; all numbers may have 
decimal points. TRAC Language only 
give* you integers to start, since it's easy 
enough to program other kinds of number 
behavior in QXkm Infinite precision). For historical ressons computers have 
been used mostly with numbers up to now 
but thst is going to be thoroughly turned ' 
-round. Within a few years there maTbe 
more text- written prose and poetry-
atored on computers then numbers. 
During the recent massive lawsuit by 
Srr;^" 'BM' U WM r«v«l«l 
that IBM had an awesome number of letters 
and communications stored on msgnelic 
memory. 
When I lived in New York, I had a 
driver's license with the staggering serial 
number 
NO 5443 12903 3-4121-37 
Now it may very veU be, as in some 
serial numbers, that information is hidden 
in the number thst Insiders can dope out, 
like my criminal record or automobile acci­
dents, if any, (N is my initial, and two 
of the digits show my date of birth, a handy 
check againat alteration by thirsty minors. 
But the rest of it is ridiculous.) The fact 
that that leaves 15 more decimal digits means 
(if no other codes are hidden) that New York 
State has provision in their license numbering 
for up to 999,999,999,999,999 inhabitanta. 
It is doubtful that there will ever be that 
many New Yorkers, or indeed that many 
human beings while the species endures. 
In other words, either New York 
State ia planning on having many, many 
more occupants, or an awfully inefficient 
code has been adopted, meaning a lot of 
memory space is wasted holding those 
silly big numbers for millions of drivers. 
However, thst doesn't represent a lot of 
money. 10 million decimal spaces these 
days fits on a couple of disk drives. But 
It's an awful pain in the neck when you 
want to cash a check. 
Data has to get inside the machine 
somehow, and results have to get back out. 
Two main types of codes— that is, stan­
dardized patterns— exist, although what 
forms of data programs work on Inside 
varies considerably. (The input data can 
be completely transformed before internal 
work starts.) 
1. ASCU (pronounced "Askey," 
American Standard Code for Information 
Exchange. This allows all the kinds of 
numbers and alphabets you could possibly 
want (for instance, Swahili) for getting 
information in and out of computers. 
ASCII is used to and from most 
Teletype terminals and key scopes. 
However, ASCII is also used for 
internal storage of alphabetical data in 
many non-IBM systems, andit la also ths 
running form of a number of programming 
languages, such as TRAC language (see 
p. 19), TECO jie* --"T. and GRASS 
(see 
IBM's deliberate undermining of ths 
ASCII code i* a source of widespread anger. 
(See IBM, p. 57,.) 
2. EBCDIC (pronounced "Ebaadick.") 
Extended Binary Coded Decimal. Thia was 
the code IBM brought out with the 360.

compatibility a* a privilege that mu«l be

Data la punched Into cards according to 
some plan associated with the program. MAGNETIC STORAGE 
Data usually has to be marshalled into 
rows, or even regiments and battalions, before 
lt can go into a computer. 
(Some people juat get their data into a 
computer by sitting at a terminal and typing 
it in. perhaps answering questions typed to them 
by s front-end program. But they're the lucky 
ones. Most of us have to get the data set up 
on some kind of holding surface before it gets 
fed in. That's sn input medium. J 
DATA MEDIA 
A date medium ("medium" is the singular 
of "media") is anything thst holds the marks of 
data outside the core memory of a computer. 
Thus punched cards and punched paper tape 
may be used as input media. used for putting 
information into a computer. (Each medium 
needs a corresponding input or output device, 
to whisk across the surface and translate Its 
marks or holes into the corresponding electronic 
pulses.) 
There are three types of data media: 
input, output snd storage media. An input 
medium carries the data in. An output medium 
receives the results of a program; for instance, 
a sheet of paper coming out of a printing device 
is an output medium, ss is a punched card or 
punched paper tape. 
Storage media are output media that may 
be used as input media later on. Thus punched 
cards and punched paper tape can be storage 
media. But the better storage media use mag­
netic recording (which is faster and leas bulky), 
like magnetic tape and disks, or just plain 
"disks" as we generally call them. (See fuller 
list of mag media under "Peripherala," p. 57 ) 
The units and arrangements of data used 
for input, output and storage are in principle 
not necessarily the true ones of the data structure 
used by the program. The blocks and records 
of storage, for instance, may have irregular 
data with pointers sitting in them. (Unfortun­
ately there is some carryover, in that program­
mers are tempted to use data structures which 
are easy to store and run in and out, rather 
than handling the true complexities of the sub­
ject. This is always s temptation.) 
Let us consider the units and arrangements 
of data used for input and output and storage. 
These are, respectively, fields, records, files 
and blocks. 
THE PUNCH CARD 
Let's begin with s fun example: that 
hoary old medium for input and output, the 
punched (or "punch") card. The punch card 
will ahow ua what a field is. 
The punch card is generally believed to 
have been invented by Herman Hollerith (al­
though the author's in laws had bitter recollec­
tions lo the contrary). It waa first uaed on a 
broad scale to count up the census of 1890, snd 
lster became an early cornerstone of IBM, but 
thst's another story. 
The punohes on a csrd represent a row 
of information (auch as a row of typed letters), 
this is not obvious because the card is a rec­
tangle rather than a line. However, the length 
of the card ia actually divided into eighty poai 
tiona, each of which may hold one number, 
alphabetic character or punctuation mark. 
These poaitiona are actually narrow columns, 
eighty of them, with different poaitiona in which 
holes may be punched. One hole in a column 
represents • numeral; which position in the 
column apecifiea what number. Two holes in 
a column generally mean a letter of the alphabet, 
three holes in a column mean a punctuation 
•rV»uc*.iTH v.«n 
J* \t*, r-^ Beyond those simple matters there is no 
preordained arrangement for information on a 
punch card; it nil depends on whnt the program 
calls for. But each separate piece or section 
of information-- each bunch of consecutive 
characters that together have a specific meaning 
— are called a field. 
A field can be a name, a number, an 
amount or money, an alphabetical code repre­
senting something, a numerical code represent­
ing something, or other stuff. When the cerda 
go into the program, the program can pick off 
the information it needs one field at a time--
putting the field in columns 1 to 17 into one 
program variable, the field from columns nine 
to ten into another program variable, and so 
The punch card is an important example 
of an input unit influencing the structure of 
computer programs. It is convenient to use 
fields on a punch card as the basic data struc­
ture of a program and say, "That's the way it 
has to be for the computer. In the worst cases 
we see the workings of the "punch card men­
tality" or "BO-column mind" (see box). 
—•People will often thrust a punched data 
card at you and ask, "What does this mean?" 
Who knows? It may have lettering banged along 
the top, showing what charscters the holes rep­
resent, but if these charscters don't Bhqw any­
thing understandable, such as the person's name, 
you're in the dark. The card may have pre­
printed section lines dividing it up, but these 
ere rarely self-explanatory. It's often im­
possible just to look at a punched card and 
tell by eye what the individual fields are for, 
or even where they begin and end; all that 
depends on the program. Only someone who 
understands the program, or at least knows 
what fields the card is divided into and what 
the characters represent there, can help. 
Sometimes, in dismal systems we encoun­
ter day-to-day— like for university registration 
— a punch card will have a person's name in 
the first few columns, or worse, a personal 
serial number. Other information continues 
from there. These may or may not be recog­
nizable, either from reading the holes by eye, 
or from designations pre-printed on the card. 
ASCII code. You can figure out from 
the table the bit pattern for any letter, or 
what any given combination of seven bits 
means. 
Example. Find the capital letter G 
in the table. For the first three bits of the 
code, look at the top of the column: 100. 
For the next four, look sideways to the 
left: Olll. So G la: 1000111.

tha number of ones in the code; this la 
called the parity bit, and either rounds to 
an even number of bits (even parity) or an 
odd number of bits (odd parity). Thus if 
a code cornea through to the computer with 
a wrong number of ones, ths computer 
can take remedial action.) 
Thoee funny multlletter codes are for 
controlling terminals and like that. 
Pocket card courtesy of Computer 
Transceiver Syatema, Inc. The same principle of fields applies in 
other data media, especially magnetic tape and 
disk. We may extend the notion of a field to 
explain records and files. 
A fl*ld- generally speaking, is a section 
of positions on some medium reserved for one 
particular piece of information, or the data in it, 
A record is a bunch of fields atored on 
some medium which have some organized use. 
(For instance, the accounting information held 
by an electric utility company about a particular 
customer is likely to be stored as a record with 
at least these fields: account number-, last name; 
initials; address; amount currently owed.) 
A file is a whole big complete bunch of 
information thst is stored someplace. In many 
applications a file la composed of numerous 
similar, consecutive records. For instance, 
an electric company may well store the records 
for all of its customers on a magnetic tape, 
ordered by account number (account 000001 
first). 
Storing sequences of similar records in 
long files is typical of business programs, 
though perhaps this should begin to change. 
It's especially suited to batch processing, 
that is. handling many records in the same 
way at the same time. (See "System Programs.") 
Now, the divisions of field, record and 
file are conceptual: they are what the program­
mer thinks about, based on the information 
needs of a specific computer program. 
A block is something else, which may be 
related only to quirks of the situation. 
A block is s section of stored material, 
divided either according to the divisions of the 
data or peculiarities of the device holding it, 
such as a disk drive. Short records may be 
stored many to a block. If records are long 
they may be made up of many blocks. 
-tin particular, tape blocks can be almost 
any size, while disk blocks often hsve a certain 
fixed size (number of characters or bits) based 
on the peculiarities of the individual device. 
(This can be a pain in the neck.) 
On the other hand, due to. the quirks of 
magnetic recording, your program usually can't 
just change something in the middle of a block; 
the whole disk block or tape file has to be re­
placed. This is less trouble with s short disk 
block than a long tape file. 
TRADITIONAL CONVEYER-BELT PROGRAMS 
Many traditional business programs sre of 
this type, reading in one data record at a time, 
doing something to it (such as noting that an 
Individual haa paid the exact amount of his gas) 
and writing out a new record for that customer 
on the current month's tape. 
THB PROBLEM 
Standardized fields, blocks snd records 
sre often necessary or convenient. But, on th* 
other hand, the kinds of computer programs 
people find oppressive often have their roots in 
this kind of data storage and Its associated styles 
of programming, especially the use of fixed-field 
records as the be-all and end-all. The more 
interesting uses of th* computer (Interactive, 
obliging, artistic, etc.) use a greater variety 
of data structures. 
People's naive idea of "programming" is often a reasonable 
approximation to the notion of "dels structure." Data atructur* 
ia how information ia est up_. After it's set up. programa 
can twiddle it; but the twiddling options ar* based on how 
the information is set up to begin with. 

--- Page 106 ---

A CONCRETE EXAMPLE . Suppose we went 
to represent the genealogy of the moneroha of Eng-
England. so far aa ia known, in a computer data 
atructure. NOTE THAT A DATA STRUCTURE IS 
DIFFERENT FROM A PROGRAM: if eeveral program­
mers agree beforehand on a data structure, then 
they can go separate ways and each can write a 
program to do something different with it-- if they 
have really agreed on a complete and exact layout. 
which they may only think they've done. 
First we con alder the subject matter. Gen­
ealogy is conceptually simple to us, but aa data 
ia not aa trivial aa it might seem at first. Every 
person haa two parenta and a specific date of birth. 
Each pair of parents can have more than one child. 
and individual parenta can at different times share 
parenthood with different other individusls. 
Presumably we would like a data structure 
that allows a program to find out who waa a given 
person's parent, who were a given person's chil­
dren, what brothers and sisters each person had. 
and similar matters (BO far as is known by histor­
ians-- another difficulty). 
Note that just because it ia simple to put this 
Information in a wall chart, that does not mean it 
la simple to figure out an adequate data structure. 
Note too, that any aspect of the: data which 
is left ou£ cannot then be handled by the program. 
What's not there is not there. 
The easy way out is to use a language like, 
say, TRAC Language, and use its basic units (in 
this case, "forms") to make up a data structure 
whose individual sections would show parentage, 
dates, brothers and sisters and so on. 
The braver approach ia to try to aet it up 
Tor something like FORTRAN or BASIC, languages 
which treat core memory more like a numerically-
addressed array or block, as does rock-bottom 
machine language. 
Let us assume that we hsve decided to use 
an array-type data structure, for instance to go 
with a program in the BASIC language on a 16-
bit minicomputer. We do not have much room 
in core memory, so for each person in our data 
structure we are going to have to store a sepa­
rate record on a disk memory, and call it into 
core memory as required. 
After much head-scratching, we might 
come up with something like the following. It 
is not a very good data structure. It is not a 
very good date structure on purpose. 
It uses a block of 28 words, or 448 bits, 
per individual, not counting the length of his 
name, which is an additional 8 bits per char­
acter or space. However, this in itself is nei­
ther good nor bad. It's more than you might 
expect, but leas than you might need. 
(Incidentally, out of concern for storage 
space, some date fields are packed more than 
one to a 16-bit computer word. This is scorn­
fully called bit-fiddling by computerfolk who 
work on big machines and don't have to worry 
about such matters.)

As explained already, that waa the basic 
block. We atill have to keep the namea some­
where, in a string area. Whether to keep thia 
in core all the time, or on dlak, la a decision 
we needn't go into hare.

Y Here are some assumptions I have embodied 
in thla deta structure. That la, I had them in 
mind. (The parte you didn't have In mind sre 
what get you later.) 
Parents and children of monarcha 
are included, as well as 
monarchs. 
All monarchs have a separate mon­
arch number. 
p No monarch reigned more than 
twice. (?) 
No monarch or parent of a monarch 
had more than five children 
of one sex. (Note the danger 
of these assumptions.) 
We are not interested in grandchil­
dren of monarchs unless they 
are also monarchs, or siblings, 
or parents of monarcha. 
The information about the different 
people can be input in any 
order, as the years of reign 
can be stepped through by s 
program to find the order of 
reign. 
If this seems like too much bother, that is 
In a way the point. Data structures must be 
thought out. Since computers hsve no intrinsic 
way of operating or or handling data (though 
particular languages will restrict you in partic­
ular ways), you will have to work all this out, 
and a carelessly chosen data structure will leave 
something out, or Tail lo distinguish among im­
portant differences, or otherwise have its revenge. 
(For instance, if you haven't noticed yet: 
we left out legitimacy. For many purposes we 
want to know which kings were bastards.) 
(Self-test: is five bits long enough to ex­
press the grestest number of months any English 
monarch reigned? -- see "Binary Patterns." Or 
do we have to fix this data structure on that 
score also?) 
A program to ascertain how many kings 
were the sons of kings would look at each entry 
that had a monarch number, test whether the 
monarch waa male, and if male, would look at 
the male parent's serial number. Then it would 
look up that parent's entry, and see whether it 
in turn had a monarch number, and if so, add 
one to the count it was making. Then it would 
go back to the entry it had been looking at. 
and step on to the one after that. 
This is actually a pretty lousy data struc­
ture. The clumsiness of this approach to such 
data-- and you ore welcome to think of a better 
one-- shows some of the difficulties of handling 
complex data about Ihe real world. Things like 
lengths of names and numbers of relatives pro­
duce great irregularities, but make these kinds 
of data no less worth of our attention. 
We could add lots of things to our data 
structure (and so make it more unwieldy). For 
instance, we might want lo mark eoch serial 
number specially if it referred to someone who 
was the offspring of a monarch. We could sim­
ply set a particular bit to 1 in the serial number 
for them (called a flag or tag). We could also flag 
dates and genealogies that are regarded as un­
certain. There is no limit to the exactness and 
complexity with which information may be rep­
resented. But doing it right can, as always, 
be troublesome. 
A lol of computer people want to avoid 
dealing with complex data; perhaps you can be­
gin to see why. But we must deal with the 
true complexities of information; therefore lan­
guages and systems that allow complex informa­
tion structures must become better-known and 
THE FRONTIER: COMPLEX FILE STRUCTURE 
The ingements of whole files-- groups 
of records or other info chunks-- are up to the 
programmer. The structure of filea is called, 
not surprisingly, file structure, and it is up to 
the programmer to decide how his filea should 
Habits die hard. The notion of sequence--
even falae, imposed sequence - is deep in the 
racial unconscious of computer people. An inter­
esting concrete term shows this nicely. Because 
computer people often think any file should have 
a baaic sequence, they use the term inverted 
file for a file that haa been changed from its 
basic sequence to another sequence. But increas­
ingly, all the sequences are false and artificial. 
Where now are inverted files? All files sre in­
verted if they're anything. 
Fortunately, the final frontier of data 
structure is now increasingly recognized aa tha 
control of complex storage of filea on diak mem­
ory. The latest fancy term for thia Is data base 
system, meaning planned-out overall storage that 
you can send your programs to like messengers. 
The fact that IBM now has moved Into thla 
area (with its intricate "access methods" and all 
their Initials) means complex storage control haa 
finally arrived, although the pioneering work 
was done by Bachman at GE some years ago 
(see bibliography). Till the laat few years, 
external storage, with pointers and everything, 
haa not been conveniently under the programmer's 
control except in crude ways. Finally we are 
seeing systems beginning lo get around lhal 
automatically handle complex file structures in 
versatile waya that programmers can use more 
easily. qastvat*-

-•This book can be recommended to 
ambitious beginners. It has useful sum­
maries of different languages, as well as 
fundamental treatment of data structures 
as they intertwine with specific languages. 
An obscure and intricate study of the inter-
chongcability of data structures-'- how they 
fundamentally interconvert-- has been the 
longtime research of one Anatol Holt, who 
calls his work Mem-Theory. Mem is from 
memory. and also, conveniently, a Hebrew

This is an extremely ambitious study, 
as it in principle embraces not juat much 
or all of computer science, but perhaps 
mathematics itself. Math freaks attention: 
Holt haa said he intended to derive all of 
symbolic logic and mathematics from 
relation* and pointer structures. Let's 
hear it for turning Russell on his head. 
I don't know if Holt has published 
snything on it in the open litersturt or not. 
However, he does have a game 
available which seems weirdly to embody

J)AT4 STfOCW 
One of the commonest end most destructive 
myths about computers is the idea that they "only 
deal with numbers." This is TOTALLY FALSE. 
Not only ia it a ghastly misunderstanding, but it is 
often an intentional misrepresents!ion, and as such, 
not only ia it a mi arep re sen tat ion but it is a damned 
lie, and anyone who tells it ia using "mathematics" 
as a wet noodle to beat the reader with. 
Computers deal with symbols and patterns. 
Computers deal with symbols of any kind--
letters, musical notes. Chinese ideograms, arrows, 
icecream flavors, snd of course numbers. (Num­
bers come also in various flavors, simple and 
baroque. See chocolate box, p, 9f\ . 
Data structure means any symbols and pat­
terns set up for use in a computer. It means what 
things are being taken into account by a computer 
program, and how these things are aet up-- what 
symbol* and arrangements are used to represent 
them. 
The problem, obviously, is Representing 
The Information You Want Just The Way You Want It, 
in all its true complexities. 
(This is often forbiddingly stated as "making 
a mathematical model"-- but that's usually in the 
rhetorical, far-fetched and astral sense in which 
all relations are "mathematical" and letters of the 
alphabet are considered to be a special distorted 
kind of number.) 
Now It happens that there are many kinda of 
data atructure, and they are interchangeable in 
intricate ways. 
The aame data, with all its relationships and 
intricacies, can be set up in a vast variety of ar­
rangements and styles which are inside-out and 
upaide-down versions of each other. The same 
thing (aay, the serial number, 24965, of an auto­
mobile) may be represented in one data structure 
by a set of symbols (such as the decimal digits 
2, 4, 9, 6, 5 in that order), and in another data 
structure by the position of something else (such 
as the 24965th name in a list of automobile owners 
registered with the manufacturer). 
Furthermore, many different forms of data 
may be combined or twisted together in the same 
overall aetup. 
The data structure choaen goes a long way 
in impoaing techniques and stylea of operation on 
the program. 
On the other hand, the computer language 
you use has a considerable effect upon the data 
structures you may choose. Languages tend to 
impose styles of handling information . The deci­
sion to program a given problem in a specific lan­
guage, auch aa BASIC or COBOL or APL or TRAC 
Language, either locks you into specific types of 
data structure, or exerts considereble pressure to 
do it a certain way. In moat cases you can't aet it 
up just any way you want, but have to adjuat to 
the language you are using-- although today's 
languages tend to allow more and more tvDea of 
data. 
Plainly, then, it ia theae overall structures 
that we really care about; but to understand over-
alt atructures, we need an idea of all the different 
forma of data that may be put in them. 
VARIABLES AND ARRAYS 
The earliest data structures in computera. 
and still the predominating ones, are variables and 
(We met them earlier under BASIC, aee 
fP-H>-f7. and APL . aee pj, ) 
A variable ie a apace or location in cor* 
memory. (Por convenience, moat programming 
languages allow the programmer to call a variable 
by a name. ao that he doesn't have to keep track 
of its numerical address.) An array (also called a table) ia a section 
of core memory which the programmer cordon8 off 
for the program to put and manipulate data in. If 
SPENCER is the name of the array , then SPENCER(l) 
Is the first memory slot in it, SPENCER(2) is the 
second, and ao on up to however big it la. 
(You can get a feel for how this ordin­
arily relates to input from outside-- see "How 
Data Comes, Goes . and Sits ," nearby .) 
The contents of a numerical field, or 
piece of data coming in, can simply be stuffed 
by the programmer into a variable. 
The contents of a record, or unified 
set of fields, con get put into an array. The 
program can then pick into it for separate 
variables. If desired, or just leave them 
there to be worked on. 
Then you twiddle your variable) 
your program as desired. with 
When you've done one record, you 
repeat. That's how lots of business programs 
go. Some other routine kinds, too. 
FANCY STRUCTURES 
Many forms of advanced programming are 
based on the ides that things don't have to be stored 
next to each other, or in any particular order. 
If things aren't next to each other, we need 
another way the program can tell how they belong 
together. 
A pointer, then-- sometimes called a link--
is a piece of data that tells where another piece of 
data is, in some form of memory . Pointers often 
connect pieces of data. 
1 One piece Pointer I 
j of Data 1 
Another piece] 
of Data 
A pointer can be an address in core memory: it 
can be an address on disk (diskpointer); it con 
point to a whole string of data, such as a name, 
when there is no way of knowing in advance how 
long the siring may be (stringpointer). 
A series of pieces of data which point to each 
other in a continuing sequence is celled a threaded 
For this reason the handling of data held together 
by pointers-- even though it may make all sorts of 
different patterns-- is called list processing. (The 
(The term "list processing" might seem to go a-
gainst common sense, as it might suggest something 
like, say, a laundry lisl. which is structured in a 
very simple blocklike form. But that's what we 
call it.) 
Prominent list-processing languages include 
SNOBOL, L6 and LISP (see p.^l ). There is argu­
ment as to whether TRAC Language is a list-proc­
essing language. 
Here are some interesting structures that 
programmers create by list processing: 
RINGS (or cycles). These are arrangements 
of pointers that go around in a circle to their first 
item again. 
deii; 
-a 
TREES. These are structures that fan out. 
(There are no rings in a tree atructure. technically 
speaking.) 
D • • an aa • 
GRAPH STRUCTURES (sometimes called 
plexca). Here the word "graph" is not used In the 
ordinary way, to mean a diagrammatic sort of pic­
ture, but to mean any atructure of connected 
points. Rings and trees are special cases of graph PAST - CHANGING DATA 
One of the uses of such structures is in 
strange types of programs where the interconnec­
tions of information are changing quickly and 
unpredictably. Such operations happen fast In 
core memory. In this kind of programming (for 
which languages like LISP, SNOBOL and TRAC 
Language are especially convenient), the pointers 
are changed back and forth In core memory, every 
which way, all the time . Presumably according to 
the programmer's fiendish master plan-- if he's 
gotten the buga out. (See Debugging, p.To .) 
FANCY FILES 
But these structures are not restricted to 
data in core memory. Complex and changeable 
filea can be kept on disk In various ways by the 
same kind of threading (called "chaining" on ma 
storage). 
Another way of handling changeable files is 
through a so-called directory block, which keeps 
track of where all the other blocks are stored. 
But these techniques, you see, may be used 
in both fast and slow operations, and for any pur­
pose, so trying to categorize them tends not to be 
helpful. (Note also that these techniques work 
whether you're dealing with bits , or characters , 
or any other form of data.) 
Note: By decent standards of English, 
the word data should be plural, datum sin­
gular. But the mBtter is too far gone: data 
is now utterly singular, like "corn" and 
"Information," a granular collective which 
may be scooped, poured or counted. 
But I draw the line at media 
ore many, "media" Is plural! Media 
"Computers pui 'orylhing into pigeonholes." 
Graph atructures 
can go any which way. Wrong. People put things into pigeon­
holes. And designers of computer programs 
can set up lousy pigeonholes. If you let 'em. 
More sophisticated programming con often 
avoid pigeonholes entirely. 
People who want to feel With It 
occasionally uae the term "bit" for 
any old chunk of information. like a 
name or address. Thia is Wrong. 
A Bit is the smallest piece of binary 
information, an item that can b* one 
of two things, like heads or tails, 
X or 0, one or zero; end all other 
information can be packed into a 
countable number of bits. (How many 
may depend on th* data structure 
chosen,) 
As a handy rule of thumb: 
uvery letter of the alphabet or punc­
tuation mark ie eight bits (se* ASCII 
box); for heavy storage of ev*ryday 
decimal numbers, every numerical 
digit can be further packed down (to 
four bit* in BCD code)

FAST ANSWERBACK IN APL 
If you want quick answers, the APL terminal 
just gives you the result of whatever you type in. 
For instance, 
7 1 2 3 4 (carriage return) 
typed-in array 
PROGRAMS IN APL 
But the larger function of APL is to create 
programs that can be stored, named and carried 
out at a later time. 
For thia, APL allows you to define programs, 
a line at a time. The programs remain stored in the 
system as long aa you want. Using the "Del" 
operator (V), you tell the system that you want to 
put in a program. Del causes the terminal to help 
you along in various ways. 
A nice feature is thai you can lock your APL 
programs, that is, make ihem Inaccessible and 
unreadable by others, whether they are 
programmers or not. in this case you define a 
program starting with the mystical sign del-tilde 
(Ays) instead of del ( V>. Bnd invoke the names 
of dark spirits. 
APL, like BASIC, can be classed as an "algebraic" 
language— but this one is built to please 
real msthematlcians, wilh high-level stuff 
only they know about, like Inner and Outer 
Products. 
Paradoxically, thia makes APL terrific for teaching 
these deeper mathematical concepts, helping 
you aee the consequences of operations and 
the underlying structure of mathematical 
things. Matrix aUjebra, for Instance, can be 
visualized a lot better by working up to It 
with lesser concepts (like vectors and 
inner products) enacted on an APL terminal. 
It would be really swell if someone would put to­
gether a tour-guide book of higher mathem­
atics at the grade/high school level for people 
with access to APL. 
Interestingly, Alfred Bork (U. of Cal. at Irvine) 
Is taking a similar approach to teaching 
physics, using APL as a fundamental 
language in his physic* 
SNEAKY REPEATER STATEMENT IN APL? 
One of the APL operators, "iota" ( i). 
seema to make Its own program loop within a line. 
When uaed one-sided, it furnishes a series of 
ascending numbers up to the number It's operating 
on. This until the last one la reached. 
You type: 3 x \ T 
APL replies: 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 
In other words, one-sided iota looks to be 
doing Its own Utile loop, Increasing its starting 
number by 1, until It gets to the value on lta right, 
and chugs on down tha line with each. 
Very aneaky way of doing a loop . 
However! It isn't really looping, exactly. 
What the lota doea Is crest* a one-dimensional 
•rray , a row of integers from 1 up to the number 
on It* right. Thia result ia what then moves on IBM doesn't sell APL services. Their time­
sharing APL Is available, however , from various 
suppliers. Of course, that means you probably 
have to have an IBM-type terminal, unless you find 
a service that offers APL to the other kind-- an 
addition which seems to be becoming fashionable. 
Usual charge Is about ten bucks an hour 
connect charge, plus processing, which depends 
on what you're doing. It can easily run over $15 
an hour, though, and more for heavy crunching 
or printout, so watch It. 
The salesman will come to your house or 
office, verify that your terminal will work (or 
tell you where you can rent one), patiently show 
you how to sign on, teach you the language for 
maybe an hour if he's a nice guy, and proffer 
—•APL services are probably safer to sign 
onto, in terms of risked expenses, than most other 
time-sharing systems. (Though of course all 
time-sharing involves financial risk.) Because 
the system Is restricted only and exactly to APL, 
you're not paying for capabilities you won't be 
using, or for massive disk storage (which you're 
not allowed in most APL services anyway), or 
for acres of core memory you might be tempted 
lo fill. 
—• In other words, APL Is a comparatively 
straight proposition, and highly recommended If 
you have a lot of math or statistics you'd like to do 
on a fairly small number of cases. Also good for 
a variety of other things, though, including fun. 
Different vendors offer interesting variations 
on IBM's bssic APL\360 package, ss noted below. 
In other words, they\ompete with each other in 
part by adding features to the basic APL\360 pro­
gram, vying for your business. Each of the ven­
dors listed also offers various programs in APL 
you can use interactively at an IBM-type terminal, 
in many cases using an ordinary typeball and not 
seeing the funny characters; though how clear and 
easy these programs are will vary. 
And remember, of course, that you can do 
your own thing, or have others do It for you, 
using APL. 
APL is also available on the PDP-10, and 
preaumably other non-IBM big machines. 
THE VENDORS 
Scientific Time-Sharing Corporation (7316 Wiscon­
sin Ave., Bethesda MD 20014) calls its 
version APL'PLUS. They'll send you a 
nice pocket card summarizing the commands. 
APL-PLUS offers over twentyfive 
concentrators around the country, per­
mitting local-call services in such metro­
politan centers as Kalamazoo and Rochester. 
(Firms with offices in both cities , please 
note.) 
They also hsve an "AUTOSTART" 
feature which permits the chaining of pro­
grams into grand complexes, so you don't 
have to call them all individually. 
APL'PLUS charges the following for 
storage, if you can dig it: J10 PER MILLION 
BYTE-DAYS. (A byte is usually one 
character.) The census is probably taken 
once a day. 
This firm also services ASCII ter­
minals, which some people will consider 
to be a big help. That means you can have 
Interactive users of APL programs st ASCII 
terminals, and that you can also program 
from the few APL terminals that aren't of 
the IBM type. 
Time Sharing Resources. Inc. (777 Northern Blvd., 
Great Neck, N.Y. 11022) offers a lot of APL 
service, including text systems and various 
kinds of file handling, under the name 
TOTAL/APL. 
Among the interesting features 
Time Sharing Resources. Inc. have added 
is an EXECUTE command, which allows an 
APL string entered st the Keyboard in 
user on-line mode to be executed as straight 
APL. This Is heavy. 
Perhaps the most versatile-sounding APL service 
right now Is offered by , of all people, a 
subsidiary of Ihe American Can Company . 
American Information Services (American 
Lane, Greenwich CT 06830) calls their 
version VIRTUAL APL, meaning thst it can 
run in "virtual memory"-- a popular 
misnomer for virtually unlimited memory--
and consequently the programmer is hardly 
subject to apace limitations st ell. Moreover, 
files on the AI5 syatem are compatible with 
other IBM languages, so you can use APL to 
try things oul quickly and then convert to 
Fortran, Cobol or whatever. (Or, conversely, 
a company may go from those other language* 
lo APL without changing the way their filea 
are stored on thla service.) APL may indeed 
Intermix wilh theae other language*, how 
And Ihe prices look especially good: 
$8.75 an hour connect, »15 a month minimum 
(actually their minimum disk space rental 
-- 1 IBM cylinder-- ao for that amount you 
get a lot of storage), But remember there 
are still core charges, and II per thousand 
characters printed or transferred to storage. 
In the West, a big vendor is Proprietary Computer 
Systems. Inc. , V*n Nuy*. Csllfornla. For an APL terminal, you might just want • 
2741 from IBM (about a hundred a month, but on a 
year contract). 
Or see the list under "Terminals" (p.^), 
or ask your friendly APL company when you sign up. 
Two more APL terminsls, mentioned here 
instead of under "Terminals" for no special reason: 
Tektronix offers one of its green ie graphics 
terminals (see flip side) for APL (the model 4013). 
This permits APL to draw pictures for you. It 
seems to be an ASCII-type unit. 
Computer Devices, Inc. supposedly makes an 
an APL terminal using the nice NCR thermal printer, 
which is much faster and quieter lhan a mechanical 
typewriter. Spookier, though. And the special 
paper costs a lot of money.

Few people know ell or APL. or would went to. 
The operation" are diverse and obscure. 
and many or them are comprehenaible only 
to people in mathematical fields. 
However. if you know a dozen or so you can 
really get off the ground 
Aa in BASIC, you can use subscripts to 
get at specific elements in arrays. Referring to 
the examples above, if you type 
JOE [2] 
you get back on your typewriter its value 
7.1 
and if you type 
NORA £2. 4J 
you get back 
There are basically four kinds of information 
used by APL, and all of them can be put in arrays. 
Three of theae types are numerical. and arrays of 
them look like thia on paper: 
Integer arraya: 2 4 -6 8 10 2048 
Scalar arrays: 2.5 -3.1416 0.001 2795333.1 
(a scalar is something that can be 
measured on a ruler-like scale, 
where there are always points 
in betweeen.) 
Logical arrays: 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 
(theae arrays of ones and zeroes are 
called "logical" for a variety of 
reasons: in this case we could call them 
"logical" simply because they sre uaed 
for picking and choosing and deciding.) 
These three numerical types of information may be 
freely intermixed in your arrays. One more type, 
however. 1B allowed. It's hard to figure out from 
the manuals, but evidently this type can't be 
mixed in with the others too freely. We refer to 
the alphabetical or "literal" array, as in 
The quick brown fox tumped over the lazy dog. 
Now, pre-written APL programs can print out 
literal information, end accept it from a user al 
a terminal, which ia why APL is good for the 
creation of systems for naive users (see "Good-Guy 
Systems," p. '7). 
Literal vectors may be picked apart, 
rearranged and assembled by all the regular APL 
operators. That's how we twiddle our text. 
CRASHING THE SYMBOLS TOGETHER 
Now that we know about the operators and 
the arraya, what does APL do? 
It works on arrays, singly and in pairs, 
according to those funny-looking symbols, ss the 
APL processor scans right-to-left. 
IVERSON'S TAFFY-PULL 
A number of baaic APL operators help you 
stretch, squish and pull apart your arrays. 
Consider the lowly comma (called "ravel," which 
means the same as "unravel"). 
,A forget A's old dimensions, 
make it one-dimensional. 
A,B make A and B one long 
one-dimensional array. 
Here la how we make things appear and disappear. 
("Compression.") 
A/B A must be a one-dimensions! 
array of ones and zeroes. 
The result is those elements 
of B selected by the ones. 
Example: 
1 0 1 / c a t 
results in 
The opposite slash has the opposite effect, 
inserting extra null elements where there 
are zeroes: 
1 1 0 l\3 5 » 
results in 
3 5 0 9 
Here's another selector. Thia operator 
takes the first or laat few of A. depending on size 
and sign of B: 
snd B 4 A is the opposite. 
If you want to know the relative poaitiona of 
numbers of different sizes in a one-dlmenaional 
array, 
^ (name of array) 
will tell you. Il gives you the positions, in order 
of size, of the numbers. And ^ doea It tor 
descending order. 
These sre Just samples. The list goes on SAMPLE PROGRAMS 
Here is an APL program that types out 
backwards what you type in. First look at the 
program, then the explanation below. 
V 
Explanation. The down-pointing triangles 
("delB") symbolize the beginning and end of a 
program, which in this case wc have called REV. 
On Line 1, the "Quote-Quad" symbol (on the right) 
causes the APL processor to wait for alphabetical 
input. Presumably the user will type something. 
The user's line of input is stuffed into thing or 
array 1. The user's carriage return tolls the APL 
processor he has finished, so it continues in the 
program. On the second line. APL takes array I 
and does a one-Bided (Jj to it, which happens to 
mean turning it around. Left-arrow into the 
quote-quad symbol means print it out. 
Because of APL's compactness, indeed, this 
magnificent program can all go on one line: 
^7 REV 
v 
First the input goes into I, (hen the processor does 
a p I (reversal) and puts it out. 
And here is our old friend, the fortune-cookie 
prisoner. 
V1NF 
'HELP, I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP' 10 o 
v 
On line 1 the program prints out whatevcr's in 
quotes. And line 2 causes it to go back and do 
line 1 again. Forever. 
THE TKT-W>-&BMJcH 'V( I|TL 
It should be mentioned at Ihis point that 
branching tests are conducted in APL programs 
by specifying conditions which are either true or 
false, and APL's answer is 1 if true, 0 if false. 
(This is another thing these logical arrays are for.) 
This operation leaves the number 1, because 3 
is greater than 2. So you could branch on a test 
with something like 
—» 7 a A > B 
which branches to line 7 in the program if A Is 
greater than B. and is ignored (as an unexccutable 
branch to line zero) if B is greater than A. 
Some love lt, some hate it. 
THE APL ENVIRONMENT 
Aside from Ihe APL language itself, lo 
program in APL you must learn a lot of "system" 
commands, alphabetical commands by which to tell 
the APL processor what you want to do in general 
-- what to store, what to bring forth from storage, 
and so on. 
Ordinarily you have a workspace, a collec­
tion of programa and data which you may summon 
by name. When it comes-- that is, when the com­
puter has fetched thia material and announced on 
your terminal that it ia ready-- you can run the 
programa and use the data in your workapace. 
You can also have passwords for your different 
workspaces, so others at other terminals cannot 
tamper with your stuff. 
This is not the place to go into the syatem 
commands, ir you're serious, you can learn them 
rrom the book or the APL salesman. 
There are many, many different error 
messages that ihe APL processor can send you, 
depending on the circumstances. It is possible 
to make many, many mIntakes In APL, and 
there are error messages for all or them. All 
or them, that ia. lhat look to the computer like 
errors; If you do something permissible that's 
not what you intended, the computer will not 
tell you. 
But It is a terminal language, designed to 
help people muddle through. Crjoitej of jYMtocy 
Iverson's notation Is built around the 
curious principle of having the same symbols mean 
two things depending on context. (Goodness 
knows he uses enough different symbols; doubling 
up at least means he doesn't need any more.) It 
turna out that this notation represents a consistent 
series of operations in astounding combinations. 
The overall APL language, really. Is the 
carrying through of this notation to create an im­
mensely powerful programming language. The 
Impetus obviously came from the desire to make 
various intricate mathematical operations eosy to 
command. The result, however, is a programming 
language with great power for simpler teaks aa well. 
Now, the consequences of this overall Idea 
were not determined by God. They were worked 
out by Iverson. very thoughtfully, so as to come 
out symmetrical-looking and easy to remember. 
What we see is the clever exploitation of apparent 
but inexact symmetries in the ideas. Often APL's 
one-sided and Iwo-sided pairs of operators are 
more suggestively similar than really the same 
thing. 
When Iverson assigns one-sided and two-
aided meanings to a symbol, often the two meanings 
may look natural only because Iverson is such an 
artist. Example: 
two-sided one-sided 
AX B AB 
A times B the sign of B 
This makes sense. To argue that it is Inherent in 
"taking away half the idea of multiplication." 
however, is dubious. 
Some symmetries Iverson has managed to 
come up with are truly remarkable. The arrow, 
for instance. The left arrow: 
Assignment statement: B (which 
may have been computed during 
the leftward scan) is assigned 
the name of A; 
The jump statement, where B 
(which may have been com­
puted during ihe leftward scan) 
is a statement number; the 
program now goes and executes 
that line. 
This symmetry is mystically interesting because 
the assignment snd jump statements are so basic 
to programming. 
Or consider this: 
x«-n 
take input from the user and 
stuff it into X. 
Another weird example: supposedly ihe 
conditional branch 
B/A 
(one way of writing, "jump to A if B is true") 
is a special case of the "compression" operator. 
(Berry 360 primer. 72 and 165.) This is very 
hard to understand, although it seems clear while 
you're reading it. 
On the other hand, there is every indication 
that APL is so deep you keep finding new truths 
in it. (Like the above paragraph.) The whole 
thing is Just unbelievable. Hooray for all that. 
APL FOR USER-LEVEL SYSTEMS 
(See "Good-Guy Systems." p. 15 ) 
Because APL can solicit text input from a uaer and analyze It, 
the language la powerful for the creation of user-level environment 
and systems-- with the drawback, universal to all IBM terminals, 
that input linea muat end with specific characters. In other worda, 
it can't be aa fully Interactive a* computer languages thai use ASCII 
terminals. 
Needless to say, the mathematical elegance and power of th* 
system Is completely unnecessary for moat user-level syatems. Bul 
It's nice to know it's there. 
APL Is probably beat for syatems with well-defined and seg­
regated filea - "array-type problems," like payroll, accounts and 
so on. It Is not suited for much larger emorphoua and evolutionary 
aluff. the way liat languages like TRAC are. Don't us* APL if 
you're going to store large evolving texts or huge brokerage data 
bases, like what tankers are free in the Mediterranean. 
The quickesl payoff may lie in using APL to replace bu*in*aa 
form* and hasten the flow of information through • compsny. A 
salesman on the road with an APL terminal, for instance, can at once 
enter hi* order* in the computer from the cu*tomer'a office, checking 
inventory directly . If th* program ia up.

Here is another example showing how we chug 
•Jong the row of symbols and take it apart, Again, 
the alphabetical entitles represent things. 
^ first operation (one-sided^ 
second operation (two-sided) 
Try dividing up these examples: 
ROMEO 
ELEANOR <3> SAM C^? SUSIE 
One more thing needs to be noted. Not only 
can we work out the sequences of operations, from 
right to left, between the symbols; the computer can 
carry them out in a stable fashion. Which is of 
course essential. 
The truth of the matter is that APL In the com­
puter is a continuing succession of things being 
operated on and replaced in the work area.

and so o 
What is effectively happening is that the APL 
processor is holding what it's working on in a 
holding area. The way it carries out the scan of 
the APL language, there only has to be one thing 
in there at a time. 
Suppose we have a simple user program, 
Y + - Z 
Starting at the right of this user program, the 
main APL program puts Z into the work area. That's 
the first thing. Then, stepping left in the user 
program, the APL processor follows the rules and 
discovers that the next operation makes it 
which happens to mean, "the negation of Z." So it 
carries this out on Z snd replaces Z with the result, 
-Z. Then, continuing to scan leftward, the APL 
processor continues to replace what was in the work 
area with the result of each operation in the suc­
cessive lines of the user program, till the program 
is completed. 
0 ^ r-y-) 
f + -7. 
.-IN SOME APL OPERATORS 
It would be insane to enumerate them all. 
but here is a sampling of APL's operators. They're 
all on the pocket cards (see Bibliography). 
For old times' sake, here are our friends: 
(And a cousin thrown in for symmetry.) 
•A plain A 
(whatever A should hsppen to be) 
A+B A plus B 
(whatever A should happen to B. 
heh heh) 
-B negation of B 
A-B A minus B 
xB the sign of B 
(expressed as -1,0 or 1) 
AxB A times B 
And here are some grooviea: 
!A factorial A 
(1x2*3 ... up to A) 
A! B the number of possible 
combinations you can get from B, 
taken A at a time 
?A a random integer 
taken from array A 
A?B take some Integers at random 
from B. How many? A. 
But. of course, APL goes on and on. There 
are dozens more (including symbols made of more 
than one weird APL symbol, printed on top of each 
other to make a new symbol). 
Consider the incredible power. Single APL 
symbols give you logarithms, trigonometric 
functions, matrix functions, number system conver­
sions, logs to any arbitrary base, and powers of e 
(a mysterious number of which engineers are fond). 
Other weird things. You can apply an oper­
ation to all the elements of an arrsy using the / 
operator: +/A is the sum of everything in A, x/A 
is the combined product of everything in A. And 
so on. Whew. 
As you may suspect, APL programs can be 
incredibly concise. (This is a frequently-heard 
criticism: that the conciseness makes them hard 
to understand and hard to change.) 
MAKE YOUR OWN 
Finally and gloriously, the user may define 
hia own functions, either one-sided or two-sided, 
with alphabetical names. For instance, you can 
create your own one-sided operator ZONK, as in 
ZONK B 
and even a two-sided ZONK, 
A ZONK B 
which can then go right in there with the big boys: 
A ^ ZONK \ ^ B 
Don't ask what it means, but it's allowed. APL THINGS, TO GO WITH YOUR OPERATORS 
As we said, APL has operators (already 
explained) and things. The things can be plain 
numbers, or Arrays (already mentioned under 
BASIC). Think of them as rows, boxes and 
superboxes of numbers: 
2 4 6 
2 4 
3 5 
1 I 
S I 10 a one-dimensional thing 
a two-dimensional thing 
a three-dimensional thing, 
seen from Ihe front. Maybe 
we better look at the levels 
side by side: 
13 2 4 
5 7 6 8 
APL can have ThingB with four dimensions, five and 
so on, but we won't trouble you here with pictures. 
Oh yes, and finally a no-dimensional thing. 
Example: 
It is called no-dimensional because there is only 
one of It, so it is not a row or a box. 
Seriously, these are arrays, and Iverson's 
APL works them over, turns them inside out, twists 
snd zsps through to whatever the answers are. 
As in BASIC and TRAC, the arrays of APL 
are really stored in the computer's core memory, 
associated with the name you give them. The 
arrays may be of all different sizes and dimen­
sionality: 
(empty Biray, but a name is 
saved for it.) 
[NUML 
3.1416] 
(a zero-dimensional array, 
since it's only one number.) 
Esch array is really a series of memory locations 
with its label and boxing information— dimensions 
snd lengths— stored separately. One very nice 
thing about APL is that arrays can keep changing 
their sizes freely, and this need be of no concern 
to the APL progTsmmer. (The srrays csn also be 
boxed and reboxed in different dimensions just by 
changing the boxing information— with an operator 
called "ravel.")

22 TWO-SIDED OPERATORS SAME SYMBOLS WORK BOTH WAYS 
In old-fashioned notations, such as ordinary 
arithmetic, we are used to the idea of an operator 
between two things. Like

or in algebra,

APL 
Some people call it a "scientific" language. 
Some people call it a "mathematical" language. 
Some people are most struck by its use for inter­
active systems, so to them it's an interactive 
language. But most of us just think of it as THE 
LANGUAGE WITH ALL THE FUNNY SYMBOLS, 
and here they are: These, too, occur in APL; indeed, APL 
can also nest two-sided operators— that is, put 
them one inside the other, like the leaves of 
a cabbage. Old-fashioned notations nest with 
parentheses. But APL nests leftward. It works 
according to a very simple right-to-left rule.

Enthusiasts see it as a language of incon­
ceivable power with extraordinary uses. Cynics 
remark that it has all kinds of extraordinary 
powers for inconceivable uses— that is, a weird 
elegance, much of which has no use at all, and 
some of which gets in the way. 
This is probably wrong. APL is a terrific 
and beautiful triumph of the mind, and a very 
useful programming language. It is not for every­
body, but neither is chess. It is for bright chil­
dren, mathematicians, and companies who want 
to build interactive systems but feel they should 
stick with IBM. 
APL is one of IBM's better products, probably 
because it is principally the creation of one man, 
Kenneth Iverson. It is mainly run on 360 and 
370 computers, though implementations exist 
for the DEC PDP-10 and perhaps other popular 
machines. (Actually iverson designed the lan­
guage at Harvard and programmed it on his own 
initiative after moving to IBM; added to the pro­
duct line by popular demand, it was not a planned 
product and might in fact be a hazard to the firm, 
should it catch on big.) 
APL is a language of arrays, with a fascinat­
ing notation. The array system and the notation 
can be explained separately, and so they will. 
Let's just say the language works on things 
modified successively by operators. Their order 
and result is based upon those fiendish chicken 
scratches, Iverson notation. 
THAT NIFTY NOTATION 
The first thing to understand about APL 
is the fiendishly clever system of notation that 
Iverson has worked out. This system (sometimes 
called Iverson notation) allows extremely complex 
relations and computer-type events to be expressed 
simply, densely and consistently. 
(Of course, you can't even type it without 
an IBM Selectric typewriter and an APL ball. 
Note the product-line tie-in.) 
The notation is baaed on operators modifying 
things. Let's use alphabetic symbols for things 
and play with pictures for a minute. is operated on by 
the next thing and operator, 
yielding another result 
which is in turn operated on by 
the next thing and operator, 
yielding final result. 
ONE-SIDED OPERATORS 
We are also used to some one-sided operators 
in our previous life. For instance: 
- 1 
means the negation of 1; 
means negating that. 
APL can also nest one-sided operators. Now . one of the fascinating kickers of APL 
is the fact that most of the symbols have both a 
one-sided meaning and a two-sided meaning; but, 
thank goodness, they can be easily kept straight.' 
Here is a concrete example: the symbol T 
or "ceiling." Used one-sided, the result of 
operator f applied to something numerical is the 
integer just above the number it is applied to: 
[7.2 is 8. Used two-sided, the result is which­
ever of the numbers it's between is larger: 
10 f 6 is 10. (There is also [_ . floor, which you 
can surely figure out.) 
Now, when you string things out into a long 
APL expression, Iverson's notation determines 
exactly when an operator is one-sided and when 
it is two-sided: 
As you go from right to left, 
another thing?) OP THING 
another op? J ^-
you generally start with a thing on the right. Then 
comes an operator. If the next symbol is another 
thing, then the operator is to be treated as a two-
sided operator (because it's between two things). 
If the object beyond the first operator is another 
operator, however, that means APL is supposed to 
stop and carry out the first operator on a one-sided 
basis. Example: 
Conclusion: 
It's two-sided. 
Interpretation: 
"subtract B from A. 
first operator is 
applied to A; 
result is worked on 
by second operator; thing, 
result is worked on 
by third operator; 
result is worked on by 
fourth operator, 
yielding final result. stop. Conclusion: 
The first operator 
is one-sided. 
Interpretation: 
"negate B." 
Then take next symbol. 
A Weifcj) exwie, jt nut WITH W n°TWOIS/. 
f*\wt.i\\\jf t*w 1t*t 
In considering the successive meanings of thia 
rebus we are proceeding from right to left, as 
you note, and each new symbol adds meaning. 
ThiB is the general idea. 
You will note, in this example. the curious 
arrangement whereby you can have several 
pictures , or operators , in a row . This is one 
of the fun features of the language. Just for kicks, let us make up a notation 
having nothing to do with computers, using these 
Iverson principles: 
1) If an operator or symbol is between two 
names of things, carry it out two-sidedly. 
If not, carry it out one-sidedly. 
2) Go from right to left. 
The best simple example I can think of involves 
file cards on the table (named A, B, C...) and 
operators looking like this: 
OJ 45} 90J 180J 455 90T 1805 
to which we may assign the following meanings: 
ONE-SIDED: ROTATION OPERATORS 
0J A do nothing to A 
45^ A rotate A clockwise 45* 
90J A rotate A clockwise 90* 
etc. 
TWO-SIDED: STAPLING OPERATORS 
B 45^ A staple A (thing named on the right) 
to B (thing named on the left) 
at a position 45* clockwise from 
middle of B's centerline. A90^B T 1 
A 90) 90} B l_ 
90! A 90} B 
455 A 90} B 
455 A 90} 90} B /x 
B 0} 45) A 
C 45) B 0) 90) A 0) A 
I ~* X* B 
4,fl, .ut (.. 
And equivalently for other angles. 
Now . using these rules, and letting our things 
be any file cards that are handy, here are some results: It's hard to believe, but there you are. This 
notation seems adequate to make a whole lot of 
different stapled patterns. 
Exercise! Use this nutty file card notation 
to program the making of funny patterns . Practice 
with a friend and see if you can communicate 
patterns through these programs. one person 
uncomprehendingly carrying out the other's 
program and being surprised . 
The point of all this has been to show the 
powerful but somewhat startling way that brief 
scribbles in notations of this type can have all sorts 
of results.

of the TRAC scanner does not re-scan the result.

FAST ANSWERBACK DM TRAC LANGUAGE 
TRAC Language can be used for fast answerback to 
simple problems. Typing in long executable TRAC expres­
sions causes the result, if any, to be printed back out 
immediately. 
For naive users, however, the special advantage is in 
how easily TRAC Language may be used to program fast 
answerback environments of any kind. 
A SERIOUS LANGUAGE; BUT BE WILLING 
TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE 
TRAC Language,is, besides being an easy language to 
learn, very powerful for text and storage applications. 
Conventional computer people don't necessarily believe 
or like lt. 
For instance, as a consultant I once had programmed, 
in TRAC Language, a system for a certain intricate form 
of business application. It worked. It ran. Anybody could 
be taught to use it in five minutes. The client was consider­
ing expanding it and installing a complete system. They 
asked another consultant. 
It couldn't be done in TRAC Language, said the other 
consultant; that's some kind of a "university" language. 
End of project. 
HOW TO GET IT 
There have been, until recently, certain difficulties 
about getting access to a TRAC processor. Over the years, 
Mooers has worked with his own processors in Cambridge. 
Experimenters here and there have tried their hands at 
programming It, with little compatibility in their results. 
Mooers has worked with several large corporations, who said 
said they wanted to try processors to assess the value of the 
the language, but those endeavors brought nothing out to 
the public. 
FINALLY, however, TRAC Language service Is pub-
lically available, in a fastidiously accurate processor and 
with Mooers' blessing, on Computility™timesharing service. 
They run PDP-10 service in the Boston-to-Washington 
area. (From elsewhere you have to pay long distance. ) 
The charge should run $12 to $15 per hour in business hours, 
less elsewhen. But this depends to some extent on what 
your program does, and is hence unpredictable. A licensed 
TRAC Language processor may be obtained from Mooers 
for your own favorite PDP-10. Processors for other com­
puters, including minis, are in the planning stage. 
TRAC Language is now nicely documented in two new 
books by Mooers, a beginner's manual and a standardization 
book (see Bibliography). 
Since Mooers operates a small business, and must 
make a livelihood from it, he has adopted the standard 
business techniques of service mark and copyright to 
protect his interests. The service mark "TRAC" serves 
to identify his product in the marketplace, and is an 
assurance to the public that the product exactly meets the 
published standards By law, the "TRAC" mark may not 
be used on programs or products which do not come from 
Rockford Research, Inc. 
Following IBM, he Is using copyright to protect his 
documentation and programs from copying and adaptation 
without authority. 
Mooers also stands ready to accommodate academic 
students and experimenters who wish to try their hands at 
programming a TRAC processor. An experimenter's 
license tor use of the copyright material may be obtained 
for a few dollars, provided you do not Intend to use the 
resulting programs commercially.

DS, formname, contents 
DEFINE STRING. Discussed in text. 
CL, formname, plugl, plug2, plug3 ... 
CALL: brings form from forms storage to working program. 
Plugl is fitted into every hole (segment gap) numbered 1, 
plug2 into every hole numbered 2, and so on. 
SS, formname, punchoutl, punchout2 ... 
SEGMENT STRING: this command replaces every occurrence 
of punchoutl with a hole (segment gap) numbered 1, and so on. 
INTERNAL FORM COMMANDS. 
(All of these use a little pointer, or form pointer, that marks a place 
in the form. If there is no form remaining after the pointer, these 
instructions act on their last argument, which is otherwise ignored.) 
LN, formname, string, default 
Looks for specified string IN the form, starting at pointer. If 
not found, pointer unmoved. (NOTE: string search can also be 
done nicely with the SS command.) 
CC, formname, default 
CALL CHARACTER: brings up next character in form, moves 
pointer to after it. 
CN, formname, no. of characters, default 
CALL N: brings up next N characters, moves pointer to after 
them. 
CS, formname, default 
CALL SEGMENT: brings up everything to next segment gap, 
moves pointer to it. 
CR, formname 
CALL RESTORE: moves pointer back to beginning of form. 
MANAGING FORMS STORAGE 
LN, divider 
LIST NAMES: replaced by all form names in forms storage, 
with any divider between them. Divider is optional. 
DD, namel, name2 ... 
DELETE DEFINITION: destroys named forms in forms storage. 
DA 
DELETE ALL: gets rid of all forms in forms storage. 
TEST COMMANDS. 
EQ, firstthing, secondthing, ifso, Unot 
Tests if EQual: if firstthing is same as secondthing, what's left 
is ifso; if not equal, what's left is if not. 
GR, firstthing, secondthing, ifso, if not 
Tests whether firstthing is numerically GReater than second-
thing. If so, what's left is ifso; if not, what's left is if not. 
OH YEAH, ARITHMETIC. 
(All these are handled in decimal arithmetic, a character at a time, 
and defined only for two integers. Everything else you write your­
self as a shorty program.)

an interpretive language 
(each step carried out directly 
by the processor without conversion 
to another form first); 
an extensible language 
(you can add your own commands 
for your own purposes); 
a Ust-processing language 
(for handling complex and amorphous 
forms of data that don't fit in boxes 
and arrays). 
It is one of the few such lan­
guages that fits in little computera. 
3. DRILLING THE HOLES TEST COMMANDS IN TRAC LANGUAGE 
There are test commands in TRAC Language, but like 
everything else they work on strings of characters. Thus 
they may work on numbers or text. Consider the EQ 
command (test if equal): 
#(EQ, firstthing, secondthing, ifso, if not) 
where "firstthing" and "secondthing" are the strings being 
compared, and ifso and if not are the alternatives. If first-
thing is the same as secondthing, then ifso is what the 
TRAC processor does, and if not is forgotten. Example: 
#(EQ, 3, #(SU, 5, 2), HOORAY, NUTS) 
If it turns out that 3 is equal to #(SU, 5, 2), which it is, then 
all that would be left of the whole string would be 
The holes (called by Mooers segment gaps) are created 
by the SEGMENT STRING instruction. 
#(SS, formname, whateverl, whatever2 ...) 
where "formname" is the form you want to put holes in and 
the whatevers are things you want to replace by holes. 
Example: Suppose you have a form 
YOU ARE A CREEP| 
You make this more general by means of the SEGMENT 
STRING instruction: 
#(SS, INSULT, CREEP) 
resulting in 
•{YOU ARE A [ 1] 
which can be filled in at a more appropriate time. 
Fuller example. Suppose we type into the TRAC 
processor the following: 
#(DS, THINGY, ONE FOR THE MONEY AND TWO FOR THE SHOW) 
#(SS, THINGY, ONE, TWO, ) 
t note space 
We have now created a form THINGY and replaced parts of 
it with segment gaps. Since each of the later arguments of 
SEGMENT STRING specifies a differently numbered gap, 
we will have gaps numbered [l], [2], and [3]. The gap [1] 
will have replaced the word ONE, the gap [2] will have 
replaced the word TWO, and a lot of gaps numbered [3] will 
have replaced all the spaces in the form (since the fifth 
argument of SS was a space). The resulting form is: 
[THINGY] 
[[ll3^1^3]THE[3]MONEY[3M^ 
We can get it to print out interestingly by typing #(CL, 
THINGY, RUN, HIDE) (since after the call, the plugged-in 
form will still be in the forms storage.) This is printed: 
RUNFORTHEMONEYANDHLDEFORTHESHOW 
or perhaps, if we use a carriage return for the last 
argument , we can get funny results. The call 
#(THLNGY, NOT A FIG, THAT, [carriage return] 
should reeult in 
NOT A FIG 
FOR 
THE 
MONEY 
AND 
THAT 
FOR 
THE 
SHOW 
In TRAC Language, every command 
is replaced by its result 
as the program's execution proceeds 
This is ingenioua, weird and highly effective while otherwise the TRAC processor would produce NUTS. 
To most computer people this looks completely inside-
out, with the thing to do next appearing at the center of the 
test instruction. Others find this feature at-trac-tive. 
DISK OPERATIONS 
Now for the juicy disk operations. Storing things on ' 
disk can occur as an ordinary TRAC command. 
#(SB,name,forml,form2,form3 ... ) 
creates a place out somewhere on disk with the name you 
give it, and puts in it the forms you've specified. Example: 
#(SB, JUNK, TOM, DICK, HARRY) 
and they're stored. If you want them later you say 
#(FB, JUNK) 
and they're back. 
Because you can mix the disk operations in with every­
thing else so nicely, you can chain programs and changing 
environments with great ease to travel smoothly among 
different systems, circumstances, setups. 
Here is a stupid program that scans all incoming text 
for the word SHAZAM. If the word SHAZAM appears, it 
clears out everything, calls a whole nother disk block, and 
welcomes its new master. Otherwise nothing happens. If 
you have access to a TRAC system (or really want to work 
on it), you may be able to figure it out. (RESTART must 
be in the workspace to begin.) 
/RESTART] _ . 
fJHftsTTEMP, #{RS))#(SS,TEMP, )#(RPT)| 
#(EQ, SHAZAM, #(TEST), (#(EVENT)))#(RPT)f 
f(CS^TEMP, (#(RESTART)))[ 
#(DA)#(FB,MARVEL)*(PS, WELCOME O MASTER)| 
In this example, however, you may have noticed more 
parentheses than you expected. Now for why. 
PROTECTION AND ONE-SHOT 
The last thing we'll talk about is the other two syntactic 
layouts. 
We've already told you about the main syntactic layout 
of TRAC Language, which is 
It turns out that two more layouts are needed, which we may 
call PROTECTION and ONE-SHOT. Protection is simply 
( ) 
which prevents the execution of anything between the 
parentheses. The TRAC processor strips off these plain 
parentheses and moves on, leaving behind what was in 
them but not having executed it. (But it may come back. ) 
An obvious use is to put around a program you're designing: 
#(DS, PROG, (#(AD, A, B))) 
f safe | 
stripped stripped 
but other uses turn up after you've experimented a little. 
The last TRAC command arrangement looks like this 
and you can put any command in it, except that its result 
will only be carried one level 
##(CL, ZOWIE,3,4) 
results in (using the forms we defined earlier), 

--- Page 114 ---

THE MAGIC SCAN 
The secret of combining TRAC commands la that 
every command, when executed, la replaced by its answer; 
and whatever may result Is In turn executed. 
There la an exact procedure for thia: 
SCAN FROM LEFT TO RIGHT 
UNTIL A RIGHT PARENTHESIS; 
r-»RESOLVE THE CONTENTS OF THE 
I PAIRED COMMAND PARENTHESES 
/ (execute and replace by the command'a result); 
STARTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RESULT, 
KEEP SCANNING LEFT-TO-RIGHT 
UNTIL A RIGHT PARENTHESIS, - j 
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END, PRINT OUT 
WHAT'S LEFT. IJ'i*adk*y«^ (>/V'<i fooin fys ,Mf0 a p(9Mt 100% 
fe.*rs ope* Ins /ar***)*/, a**1 
*fr (POW!) 
IT'S SuKKfAVdoftGC/ 
The beauty part ts how it all works so good. 
An arithmetic example — so you get the procedure. 
#(AD,2,»(AD,3,4)) 
H 
execute what's in the 
command parentheses 
Si replace 
with their answer, leaving: 
scan to next right parenthesis 
execute L replace 
find no more parentheses 
print out what's left. 
You might try this yourself on a longer example: 
#(AD,»(SU, • {AD,3,4),#(SU,7,3)),1) 
Here is an interesting case: 
# (AD, 1) 
There's no third argument to add to the 1 — bu* that's 
okay In TRAC Language. 1 it remains. 
PULLING IN OTHER STUFF 
The core memory available to the use Is divided into 
two areas, which we may call WORKSPACE and STANDBY. 
• (ML, #(AD,7,3), #(SU,16, fl)) 
STANDBY 
Strings with Names 
The Standby area contains strings o( characters with names. 
Here could be some examples: 
|HAROLD 
Ijgg. HELP: I AM TRAPPED IN A LOOPWCL, PROGRAM)] 
[I MUSTN'T FORGET MY GALOSHEsTf 
There is an instruction that moves things from the 
Standby area to the Workspace. This is the CALL 
instruction. 
• (CL, whatever) 
The CALL instruction pulls In a copy of the named string 
to replace it, the call instruction, in the work area. The 
string named in the call Instruction also stays in the Standby 
area until you want to get rid of it. Example: 
#(CL, HAROLD) 
would be replaced by 
54321 
Suppose we say In a program 
#(AD,l,#fCL, HAROLD)) 
Then the result is: 
54322 
Now let's do a program loop using the CALL. II we 
type in to our TRAC processor 
*(CL, PROGRAM) 
it should type 
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
Indefinitely. 
Why is this? Let's go through the steps. 
We noted lhat in our Standby area we had a atrlnif 
named PROGRAM which consisted of 
•{PS, HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP)#(CL. PROGRAM) 
The TRAC processor acans across lt to the first right parenthesis. 
•jPMIELPM AM TRAPPED IN^RQGRAM LOOP),[CL, PROGRAM) 
and now executes this. ~~ 
PRWTh8TR*™r-th'! PS " lhC PRINT 8TRI"G instruction, fhe^it7?2^rta? 0U' 'U "Cond a"Tument, forgets me rest. But the only argument after PS la HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
so it prints that. If it had said 
HELP, I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
the PRINT STRING command would only have printed 
HELP 
Since a comma ends an argument in TRAC language. 
Now, the PRINT STRING command leaves no result, so 
it Is vaporized; all we have left in the work area is 
#(CL, PROGRAM) 
which Is now scanned. But that's another CALL, and when 
It is executed by fetching the object called PROGRAM, its 
replacement In the work area Is 
#(PS, HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP)»(CL, PROGRAM) 
and guess what. We done U again. 
(Another example of TRAC Language's consistency: 
suppose It executes the command 
*(CL, EBENEZER) 
when there is no string called EBENEZER. The result ia 
nothing; so that command disappears, leaving no residue. ) 
THE FORM COMMANDS 
Let us be a little more precise. The Standby area 
Is really called by Mooers "forms storage, " and a string-
with-name that is kept there is called a form. One reason 
for this terminology is that these strings can consist of 
programs or arrangements that we may want to fit together 
and combine. Thus they are "forms". 
1. CREATING A FORM 
#(DS, formname, contents) 
The arguments used by DS give a name to the form and 
specify what you want to have stored in it. Example: 
#(DS, ELVIS, 1234) 
I named ELVIS with contents 1234. 
(Note that to get a program into a form without its being 
executed on the way requires some preparation. For this, 
"protection" is used; see end of article.) 
II turns out that DEFINE STRING is the closest TRAC 
Language has to an assignment statement (as In BASIC, 
LET A = WHATEVER). If you want to use a variable A, 
say, to Store the current result of something, In TRAC 
Language you create a form named A. 
• CDS, A, WHATEVER) 
Whenever the value of A is changed, you redefine form A. 
2. CALLING A FORM. 
As noted already, 
• (CL, ELVIS} 
will then be replaced by 
1234 
Bul a wonderful extension of this, that hasn't been 
mentioned yet, Is 
2A. THE IMPLICIT CALL. 
You don't even have to say CL to call a form. If the 
first argument of a command - that is, the first string 
inside the command parentheses — is not a command known 
to TRAC Language, why, the TRAC processor concludes 
that the first argument may be the name of a form. So now 
if you type 
#(AD, '(HAROLD), # (ELVIS)) 
It will first note, on reaching the right-paren of the 
HAROLD command, that since HAROLD Is 54321, you 
evidently wanted this: 
• (AD, 54321, '(ELVIS)) 
eaca/i of result 
and then will do the same with ELVIS: 
*(AD, 54321,1234) 
so that pretty soon It'll type for you 
55555 Thia language is marvelously suited to data base management, 
management information systems, interactive query syatems, 
and the broad spectrum of "business" programming. 
For large-scale scientific number crunching, not so (rood. 
With one enceptlon: "Infinite precision" arithmetic, when 
people want things lo hundreds of decimal places. 
Chugga chugga. 
This implicit call is the trick that allows people to create 
their own languages very quickly. In not very long, you could 
create your own commands - aay ZAPP.MELVIN and some 
more; and while at first It Is more convenient to type in the 
TRAC format 
"(ZAPP, "(MELVIN)) 
it is very little trouble in TRAC Language to create new 
syntaxes of your own like 
ZAPP I MELVIN 
that are Interpreted by the TRAC processor aa meaning the 
same thing. 
2B. FILLING IN HOLES. 
Another thing the CALL command in TRAC Language 
does is fill in holes that exist In forms. Let us represent 
a hole as follows: 
[ 1 
[WORD 
Additional arguments in the call get plugged Into holes in 
the form. Examples: 
call result 
• (CL.WORD) HT 
f(CL,WORD,0) HOT 
•{WORD, A) HAT 
•{WORD.OO) HOOT 
Now, a form can have a number of different holes. 
Let us denote these by 
|1](2||3||4| ... 
Now suppose we have a form 
-' [»|H|2|T|3)/ 
which we might call numerous ways: 
call result 
"(WORD, W, I, E) WHITE 
• (WORD,, OO, OWL) HOOTOWL 
(Note that putting nothing between two 
commas made nothing the argument.) 
• (WORD, •(WORD, ,OB,Oi HOTSHOT 
Perhaps you can think of other examples. 
This fill-in technique Is obviously useful for program­
ming. If a form contains a program. Its holes can be made 
to accept varying numbers, form names, text strings, 
other programs. Example: Suppose we want to create a 
new TRAC command, ADD, that adds three numbers Instead 
of just two. Fair enough: 
lADfl)^. 
IAD,[l|,llAD.|2),[3J|i] and there you are. 
This brings up another example of how nicely TRAC 
Language works out. Suppose you have the following In 
forms storage: 
XZAPjlL.[2j)] 
paper. Suppose you 
• (ZOWIE.5,7) 
It happens that the arguments 5 and 7 will be passed neatly 
from ZOWIE to ZIP to ZAP to the final execution of the AD; 
all through the smooth plugging of holes by the Implicit call 
and the Magic Scan procedure of the TRAC processor.

A mild-mannered man in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
who owns his own very small business, is the creator of one 
of the most extraordinary and powerful computer languages 
there is, though lots of people in the field don't realize it. 
The language is fairly well-known among professionals, but 
its real power is hardly suspected. 
If BASIC is a fairly conventional programming language, 
strongly resembling FORTRAN. TRAC (Text Reckoning and 
Compiling) Language is fairly unusual. 
The name of it Is "TRAC Language, " not just TRAC — 
because it's a registered brand name (like Kleenex Tissues). 
Within the rules, the word "TRAC" is an adjective and not a 
noun. Thus TRAC is its first name, Language is its last; so 
we can refer to "TRAC Language" instead of having to 
precede it with the. 
It is included here for several reasons. 
1) It is extremely easy to learn, at least for beginners. 
Experienced programmers often have trouble with it. 
2) It is extremely powerful for non-numeric tasks. In 
fact, it is ideal for building your own personal language. 
3) It offers perhaps the best control of mass storage, 
and your own style of input-output, of any language. 
4) It is superbly documented and explained with the new 
"The Beginner's Manual for TRAC Language" which is now 
available. 
5) It is likely to catch on one of these days. (Some 
large corporations have been investigating it extensively.) 
It is not so much the basic idea 
of TRAC Language, but the neatness 
with which the idea has been elaborated, 
that is so nice. 
As a side point, here is an 
important motto for thinking in general 
about computers (and about other things 
in general): 
MAKING THINGS FIT TOGETHER WELL 
TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND THOUGHT. 
Let Calvin Mooers' TRAC Language be a 
shining example. 
TRAC Language is great for creating highly interactive 
systems for special purposes, including turnkey systems for 
inexperienced users and "good-guy" systems. It combines 
this with good facilities for handling text, and what is needed 
along with that, terrific control over mass storage. It is 
also excellent for simulating complex on-off systems; rumor 
has it that TRAC Language was used for simulating a major 
computer before it was built. 
Against these advantages we must balance TRAC 
Language's less fortunate characteristics. For numerical 
operations it is extremely slow, if not terrible, compared to 
the most popular languages. The same applies to handling 
numerical arrays and controlling loops, which are compara­
tively awkward in TRAC Language. 
Finally, many programmers are incensed by the 
number of parentheses that turn up in TRAC programs; in 
this it resembles the language LISP. But this is an aesthetic 
judgement. 
The TRAC Language has been thought out in grpat 
detail for total compatibility of all parts. (Moreover, by 
standardizing the language exactly, Mooers heroically 
assures that programs can be moved from computer to 
computer without difficulty.)

for the Reactive Typewriter", copyright © 1966 by Rockford 
Research, Inc. 
I am grateful to C.A.R. Kagan, of Western Electric 
Engineering Research Center, for his extensive 
(and finally successful) efforts to interest me in 
TRAC Language. In the well-thought-out ramifications of its basic concept, 
the TRAC Language is so elegant as to constitute a work of 
art. It beautifully fulfills this rule: 
"... the facilities provided by the language should be 
constructed from as few basic ideas as possible, and 
... these should be general-purpose and interrelated 
in the language in a way which avoided special cases 
wherever possible." (Harrison, Data-Structures and 
Programming, pub. Scott, Foresman, p. 251.) 
The fundamental idea of TRAC Language, which has 
been worked out in detail wl£h the deepest care, thought and 
consistency, is this: 
ALL IS TEXT. 
That is, all programs and data are stored as strings of 
characters, in the same manner. They are labelled, stored, 
retrieved, and otherwise treated in the same way, as 
strings of text characters. 
Data and programs are not kept in binary form, but 
remain stored in character form, much the way they were 
originally put in. The programs are examined for execution 
as text strings, and they call data in the form of text strings. 
This gives rise to certain interesting kinds of 
compatibility. 
a) Complete compatibility exists in the command 
structure: the results of one command can become another 
command or can become data for another command. 
ALMOST NOTHING CREATES AN ERROR CONDITION. 
If enough information is not supplied to execute a command, 
the command is ignored. If too much information is supplied, 
the extra is ignored. 
b) Complete compatibility exists in the data: letters and 
numbers and spaces may be freely intermixed. Special 
terminal characters (like carriage returns and backspaces) 
are handled just like other characters, giving the program­
mer complete control of the arrangement of output on the 
page. 
c) Complete compatibility also exists from one computer 
to another, so that work on one computer can be moved to 
another with ease. By the trademark TRAC, Mooers 
guarantees it — an innovation. 
COMMAND FORMAT 
A TRAC command has the following form. The cross-
hatch or sharp-sign is the way this language identifies a 
command's beginning. 
#(NM, arg2, arg3, arg4,..) 
NM is the name of any TRAC command. It counts as the 
first "argument, " or piece of information supplied. Arg2, 
arg3, etc. are whatever else the command needs to know to 
be carried out. 
We will look first at examples that use the arithmetic 
commands of TRAC Language, not because it is particularly 
good at arithmetic, which it isn't, but because they're the 
simplest commands. The arithmetic commands are AD 
(add), SU (subtract, ML (multiply), DV (divide). Each 
arithmetic command takes three arguments, the command 
name and two numbers. Examples: 
#(AD,1,2) 
is a command to add the numbers 1 and 2. 
#(SU,4,3) 
is a command to subtract the number 3 from the number 4. 
#(ML,632,521) 
is a command to multiply 632 by 521. 
#(DV,100,10) 
is a command to divide 100 by 10. 
Now comes the interesting part. 
The way TRAC commands may be combined provides 
the language's extraordinary power. This is based on the 
way that the TRAC processor examines the program, which 
Is a string of character codes. Watch as we combine two 
AO instructions: 
#(AD,3,#(AD, 2,5)) 
The answer is 10. Miraculous! 
How can this be? 
JT A comma ends an argument 
in the TRAC language? 
Ah, that all arguments 
could be ended so easily.

PRINT "HOW OLD ARE YOU" 
INPUT A 
LET B = A/40.0 
PRINT "YOUR AGE IS" . B. "TIMES THE AGE 
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING." 
END 
ThU will cause the following to happen: 
Program types: 
HOW OLD ARE YOU? 20 
Program types: 
YOUR AGE IS .5 TIMES THE AGE OF THE EMPIRE 
STATE BUILDING. 
The IF command 
The IF command Is a way of teaiing what's stored 
tn a variable. Example: 
88 IF M = 40 then 63 
Thla teats variable M to see if it contains the number 40. 
If M la indeed 40. the program follower jumps to line 63. 
If not. it goes right on and takes the next higher instruction 
after 88. The IF can test other relations than equality, 
including "leaa that." "greater than." "not equal," "less 
than or equal to." etc. For instance, 
89 IF Q 7 then 102 
will send the program follower to command 75 if variable 
Q containa a number less than 7. (Note that different BASICa 
for different computers may have slightly different rules

The BASIC language, developed at Dartmouth, must not be 
confused with the underlying binary languages of individual 
computers (aee "Rock Bottom," p.32,). These underlying 
codes arc called "machine languages" (or. In a dressed-up 
form, easier to use for programmers, "assembler language") 
These are the basic languages , different for each machine. 
Dartmouth BASIC, or jut plain Basic, is a widely available, 
standardized, simple beginner's language.

The program will start typing thusly:

24 BOTTLES OF BEER IN THE WALL 
and ao on. until Z has reached 0; then it will type 
0 BOTTLES OF BEER IN THE WALL

and then it will atop. 
You will note that this program, like the one that 
printed "HELP. 1 AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP," has a loop, 
that ia, a repeated sequence of operations . The first one 
was an endless loop , which repeated forever. Thia loop, 
however, is more well behaved (by some people's standards), 
In that it allows an escape when a certain criterion has 
been reached-- in thia case, printing a line of text 25 times 
with variants. 
The reason we are able to escape from this loop is 
that we have a test instruction, IF statement number 62. 
It la very Important for the programmer to Include 
tests which allow the program to get out of a loop. This 
may be couched as a motto, viz.: 
LEAK BEFORE YOU LOOP. 
AH AUTOMATIC LOOP 
Indeed, for people who are big on program loops, 
BASIC provides a pair of instructions which handle the 
program loop completely. These are the FOR and NEXT 
instructiona. Wc won't show them here, but they're not 
very hard. Using the FOR command, you can easily direct 
the computer to do something a million and one tunes, say. 
This can be exhilarating. You can even direct It lo Include 
that program in something to be done a billion times, resulting 
in s program loop that would be carried out over a trillion 
tlmea. All in a short program! But of course thia ia Juat 
power on paper; we went our programa lo be useful, and 
finish their Job a in the present century, and so such flights 
are Juat mental exercises. 
FAST ANSWERBACK WITH BASIC (in some versions) 
If you want a fast answer to a numerical question, 
you can do it without the line numbers. typing in 
PRINT 3.1416 • 7124 
will cause BASIC to print the answer right out and forget 
ths whole thing. 
TEXT STR1NOS IN BASIC 
Tha deluxe versions of the Dartmouth BASIC 
language have operations for handling text-* 
or what computerfolk call "strings," that ia. 
string* of alphabetic characters and punctuation. 
Theae operationa tend lo begin with t (standing 
for "Jtring"?) and there's no room for them here.

or print out the nine hundred million name* of

AND CAN SAVE SOME COMPANIES A LOT OF MONEY 
BASIC fa a very serious language. Advanced vera ion a 
of BASIC have Instructions that allow users lo put tn alphabetical 
information, and store and retrieve all kinds of Information 
from disks or tape. In other words, BASIC can be used 
for the fairly Blmple programming of a vast range of problems 
and "good-guy systems" mentioned elsewhere. Complete 
BASIC systems allowing complex calculations can be had 
for perhaps 13000; a general-purpose computer running 
BASIC with cassette or other mass storage, for bualneaa 
or other purposes, can now he had for some $6000. Allowing 
a few thousand dollars for programming specific applications 
In BASIC, simple systems can be created for a variety 
of purposes that some companies might say you needed 
a hundred-lhousand-dollar system for. 
This la serious business. Languages like BASIC 
must be considered by people who want simple syatems 
to do understandable things in direct ways that are meaningful 
to them, and that don't disrupt their companies or their 
lives. 
This has been a very hasty and brief presentation 
in which I have tried to convey the feeling of this important 
language. If you have the chance to learn it, by all means

WHERE TO GET IT 
(Features of the BASIC language vary considerably 
from system to system. Which ones offer the highly desirable 
alphabetic commands and mass storage have to be checked 
out individually.) 
BASIC is offered on many if not most timesharing services, 
so you can use it from your home on a lerminal. (But note lhat 
this can be expensive and even dangerous, if you're paying 
yourself; there arc not presently adequate cost safeguards lo 
prevent you from running up huge bills .) 
BEST BUY? Rumors persist of a lime-sharing service 
somewhere that offers BASIC for $S an hour, total, with disk 
storage thrown in. I have not been able to verify this. 
DEC offers minicomputer-based systems which tlme-
ahsrc BASIC among several terminals simultaneously. (But 
you have to buy the whole big system .) The ones that 
run on the PDP-8 sre marketed mainly to schools, and for 
this reason are called, somewhat peculiarly. EDUSYSTEMS 
Their multiterminal system for the PDP-11 is called RSTS 
(pronounced "Kisstiss,") and is marketed mainly to businesses. 
Hewlett-Packard offers BASIC, I believe, on all of 
its minicomputers. Of special interest is an odd computer 
called the Series 9800 Model 30. You're only allowed to 
program in BASIC. (It's actually a microprocessor; see 
p.ID 
Many other minicomputer manufacturers now offer 
BASIC. Data General's NOVA is one.

dimensional array is like a tabletop, a three-
dimensional array is like a box, and for more 
dimensions you can't visualize. 
Arrays are handy for working with a lot of 
different things one at a time. They can be given 
names just like varinbles. 
Suppose you have a one-dimensional array 
named SAM. Then in a program you can usually 
ask for the third element in SAM by referring lo 
SAM (3). Belter lhan that: you can refer by turns 
lo every element of SAM by using a counting 
variable and changing its value. SAM (JOE) can be 
any one of the elements of the array, if we set the 
value of JOE. Ihe counting variable, to the number 
of Ihe position wo want to point to. 
For arrays having more than one dimension, 
the principle is the same. You may refer in a 
program to any apace in the array by giving a 
number in parentheses, or subscript, specifying 
ihe space's position in each dimension. Suppose 
you have an array named PRICES, which gives 
the prices of, say, various sizes and brands of 
TV sets.

BASIC is a good example of an "algebraic" type of 
language, that ia, one formulated more or 
leas lo look like high-school algebra and 
permit easy conversion of certain algebraic 
formulas Into actual runnable programs. 
The most widuly used language of thia type is 
FORTRAN (see p.3| ). Thus BASIC ia 
often referred to aa a "Fortran-type language." 
The kickeroo-- and if you understand Ihis it's half 
the battle - ia that a line of BASIC or FORTRAN 
directs a certain event to take place, while 
a statement in algebra Juat describes relatione. 
The strange reaemblance between the deacrlplive 
language (algebra) and the prescriptive 
language (Fortran or Basic) ia that algebraic 
operationa (which are just recombinatlona 
and restatements) can be mimicked by the 
computer language, and this early obaeaslon 
of mathy computerfolk led to making the 
computer language look like a descriptive 
algebra. Especially with Ihe weird use of 
the equals-sign lo mean "is replaced now by." 
In hindsight this waa a ridiculoua idea; 
some of the more recent languages (Such as 
APL) use a left-pointing arrow instead of an 
equal* sign, showing lhat an action ia being 
called for, rather than a relationship being 
described. Suppose you have a two-dimensional array 
giving the telephone numbers, salaries and ages 
of several different employees of a company. You 
have decided to call the array WHAM. 
Tel.no. 
Salary 
Age 
You can refer to any single entry in this array aa 
WHAM(IRV.JOE), where IRV and JOE are two 
counting variables you've decided to set up. 
If you set 1KV and JOE both to 1. 
WHAM(IRV.JOE) is really WHAM(l.l). which 
refers you to Ihe telephone number of employee A. 
If you change JOE to 2, that gives you WHAM(l.l), 
giving you B's phone; while WHAM(2,1) would ba 
A'a salary.

BASIC 
The BASIC language, also called Dartmouth-Basic, 
was introduced in the Bixtiea at Dartmouth College by John 
Ketneny and Thomas Kurtz. It was intended to be s simple 
and easy-to-learn introduction to computer programming, 
yet powerful enough to do useful things. It has grown In 
use , in recent years, both ss the foremost beginner's language, 
and as a perfectly fine language for doing many simple 
kinds of work— like custom business applications, statistics, 
and "good-guy" ayBtems for nai. s users as discussed elsewhere 
in this book. 
Kemeny is now president of Dartmouth, and Kurtz 
runs their high-power time-sharing computer center, ao 
BASIC has a permanent home base there. 
Note that the name BASIC does not refer to the bottom-
level or elemental languages of computers. BASIC has 
been contrived specifically to make programming quicker 
and easier. It is not "basic" to all computers; such bottom 
languages are called "machine language" or "assembler 
language" (see pp. 
The simplicity of the language begins at the program 
input, or editing, level. Each command of BASIC must 
be on a separate line, and each line must have a separate 
line number. Suppose you accidentally type in 
50 IMPUGN Y 
when you meant "INPUT" instead of "IMPUGN." You may 
replace that command at any time by typing the same line 
number and the new version of the line, 
50 INPUT Y Every time you change one of the lines of the program the 
BASIC processor will insert, delete or replace lines as 
you have commanded, then rearrange whatever's left accordingly. 
In order of the line numbers. 
Then when you tell the processor to start the program, 
by typing (with no line number) 
the processor will start the program going at the command 
with the earliest line number, and your instructions will 
be executed according to the rules of BASIC. 
Now we will consider s 
of BASIC. s of the commands (or statements) 
Theae two boys had never seen a computer before, 
but 1 loaded it up with the BASIC language processor, 
showed them a few basic commands and told them to 
turn it off when they were through. 
I got back ten hours later and they were Btill at it. 
Too bad kids have such short attention spans. 
which automatically replaces the previously line 50. If 
you want to get Ha of the line entirely, you type 
50 
and an end-of-line code, and the whole line is gone. 
Example of a BASIC command: 
153 LET X = Y 
You can choose any line numbers you want, but the lines 
are automatically put in the order of their numbers. Since 
when you write a program you don't usually know at the 
outset what it will look like later, you try to leave enough 
gaps in the numbers at the start to fit in the instructions 
you might want to put between them later. 
THE SETTING 
To begin with, there must be a computer, and it 
must have a processor for the BASIC language. that la, 
a program For carrying out the operations of Dartmouth-
BASIC. We will assume that this BASIC processor is all 
set up in core memory ready to go. 
Ca».|H>V 
BASIC 
Ok (Note: This is how lt looks • 
In a minicomputer. On 
a time-sharing system there's 
a lot of irrelevant other 
atuff going on, which we'll 
leave out.) 
And we will assume, aa previously mentioned, that you 
have some kind of a terminal-- that ia, a device with a keyboard, 
aome kind of place the computer can aend messages to you 
and vice verse, and is more or less standard. 
Now then: all that ia needed Is for you to understand 
the BASIC language, and you can program thia computer 
within the confine* of BASIC. 
**• It is one of the strange aspects of this field that 
languages can be taught independently of discussions of 
the machine itself. VARIABLES 
The BASIC language, like a number of other languages, 
allows you to set aside places in core memory and give 
them names. These places may hold numbers. They can 
be used to count the number of times that things are done 
(or not done), to hold answers, numbers to test against, 
numbers to multiply by and so on. 
In BASIC, these places are given names of one alphabeti­
cal letter. That means you can have up to 26 of them. 
Examples: 
1 sometimei even X 
Because these named spaces in memory may be used 
something like the way letters are used in algebra, we 
call them variables. In fact, each one is a place with a 
name. 
EEL fji-w"! t\*\. Act-* I *44*«J eouUU 
e*H*t#i. 
If you use the names B ,C and D for variables In your 
program, the BASIC processor will automatically setup 
places for them to be stored. The END command 
The END command in BASIC simply consists of the 
word END. It must come last in the program. Therefore 
it must have the highest line number. Example: 
99 END 
The PRINT command 
Whenever the program follower gets to a PRINT command, 
it prints out on the terminal whatever Is specified. Exsmple: 
97 PRINT "HAIL CAESAR. BIRD THOU NEVER WERT" 
When and if the program follower gets to this command, 
the terminal will print out 
HAIL CAESAR. BIRD THOU NEVER WERT 
The GOTO command (pronounced "Go 2") 
The GOTO command tells the program follower the 
number of the next command for it to do, from which It 
will go on. Example: 
62 GOTO 99 
which means that when a program follower gets to command 
#62, it must next Jump to 99 and go on from there, unless 
that happens to be the END statement. 
A SIMPLE SAMPLE PROGRAM 
These are enough commands to write a sample program. 
43 PRINT "HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP" 
67 GOTO 43 
68 END 
The program will start at the first instruction, which 
happens in this case to be instruction number 43. That 
one prints a message. The next command, by line number, 
is 67. This tells the program follower to go back to 43, 
which it does. 
43 PRINT "HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP" <-i 
67 GOTO 43 ' 
68 END 
The result is that your terminal will print 
HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP 
HELP, I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP 
HELP, I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP 
Interminably, or until you do something drastic. It never 
gets to the END statement. (Two strategies for doing something 
drastic are usually to hold down the CONTROL button and 
type C, or hold down both CONTROL and SHIFT buttons. 
If you hsve them, and type P. One of these usually works.) 
The LET command 
The LET command puts something into a variable. 
Example: 
43 LET R= 2.3 
What is on the right side of the equals sign in the laat statement. 
in this case 2.3, is stuffed into whatever location of core 
memory is designated on the left side, in this case a place 
known to you only as R. With the result that someplace 
in core memory ia 
The LET statement is an example of an assignment statement, 
which most computer languages have; an assignment statement 
assigns a specific piece of Information (often a number, 
but often other things) to some name (often standing for 
a particular place in core memory). 
The LET command in BASIC can also be uaed to do 
arithmetic. Example: 
14 LET M = 2.3 + (12-7999.1) 
(The asterisk has to be used for multiplication because 
traditionally terminals don't have a times-sign.) BASIC 
will work this out from right to left snd store the result 
in M. 
Tha INPUT command 
The INPUT statement asks the person at the terminal 
for a number and then shoves it into a variable. Example: 
41 INPUT Z 
which causes the terminal to type a question mark, and 
wait. When the user has typed in a number foUowsd by 
a carriage return, the BASIC processor stuffa Ihe number 
Into the variable and proceeds with ths program. Here 
is a program uaing the INPUT statement.

are what make computers go 'round. 
H your computer only did one thing, 
then to start it you'd only need one button to 
If your computer only did two do sen 
things, without variations, then you could 
let each operation be started by pressing-
one of the keys of the terminal, and thai 
would be that. 
But that's not what it's about. 
We have lota of different things that wc 
want computers to do, and we want one com­
mand to work on different varieties of data, or 
on the results of a previous command, or even 
to chew on another command itself: and so a 
computer language is a contrived method of 
g-iving commands to a computer that allows 
the commands to be entwined in a complex fashion. 
Thia means having rules the computer can 
carry out and the person can remember. 
This means having baaic operations that 
can be built Into bigger operations (routines, 
subroutines, subprograms, programs). 
Thus a computer language is really 
a method by which a user can tie these 
programs together. Computer languages 
are built according to contrived sets of 
rules for tying programs together. Such 
rules arc 1imi ted only by the imagina­
tion of their contrivers, Each computer 
language has its own contrived system of 
rules, and it may be completely different 
from the contrived rules tying together 
any other computer language. (That's one 
reason for here presenting three differ­
ent computer languages, to show some of 
the mad variety that can exist.) 
Computer languages tend to look like 
nothing else you've ever seen. Thus com­
puter programs, which of course have to 
be written in these computer languages, 
look pretty weird. Some programs look 
like old train schedules (in nultiple 
columns). Some look a little like prin­
ted poetry. In any case, a COMPUTER PRO­
GRAM NO MORE LOOKS LIKE ITS RESULT THAN 
THAN THE WORD "COW" LOOKS LIKE A COW. 
One of the central concepts of this 
book is that of a'"program follower," a 
dynamic entity which somehow follows a 
program, '.Veil, EVERY LANGUAGE HAS A PRO­
GRAM FOLLOWER FOLLOWING ITS OWN PARTI­
CULAR RULES. These rules are contrived 
for convenience, suitability to a purpose, 
and "aesthetics" of a sort-- often some 
forra of stark compression. (The program 
followers wired into computers are some 
what more akin to one another; see "Rock 
Bottom," p. 32.) About all we can say 
languages have in common is: EVERY COM­
PUTER LANGUAGE ALLOWS LOOPS, TESTS AND 
BRANCHES, AND COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL 
DEVICES, as mentioned on p. 11. Beyond 
that the differences are incredible. 
So the basic secret of computer peo­
ple is this: it's not that the necessar­
ily know so much, but they can adapt to a 
whole new world of possibilities more 
quickly. "lHl3££ i,jui,:iciei

One. they can be used from a terminal, which 
means that you could in principle get a terminal 
in your home and play with the computer from 
over the telephone. But this is expensive, 
and at worst fraught with accidental financial 
liabilities, so the possibility is minor right now.

You would think the fundamental dichotomy 
among: computer terminals waa between those that 
print on paper and those that show you stuff on 
• screen. But it isn't. (That's like the difference 
between people and whales- much greater outside 
than inside.) 
Actually the fundamental distinction between 
terminals is between ASCII (pronounced "Askey") 
and IBM terminals. ASCII is a code and scheme 
of organization which was adopted by "the indus­
try." under the blessing of the National Bureau 
of Standards. But IBM has pointedly ignored this 
standard. 
The principal terminal of the ASCII type, 
in sheer numbers, is the model 33-ASR Teletype 
(trademark of Teletype Corp.). so this kind of 
terminal Is called the "33 ASR type." or "Teletype-
type." or wc even say a given terminal "looks 
to the computer like a Teletype." 
IBM, however, seems to like changing its 
systems around a lot. for instance changing its 
codes when it brings out a new computer. (For­
tunately, it just happens thai they also sell adap­
ters between them. Whew.) So IBM-type terminals 
are different by design. 
There is one main type, however, exem­
plified by the IBM model 2741 terminal. Thus we 
say a terminal is an "IBM-type" or "2741-type" 
terminal. 
Both Teletype- and IBM-type terminals 
come in either video-acreen or printing models, 
from a variety of manufacturers. 
Indeed, even the Selectric (IBM trademark), 
__EB«=p-i-=-3 typing mechanism appears in some 
Teletype-type terminals. 
There is a very important performance 
difference between ASCII and IBM terminals. 
The ASCII terminal can send each character typed 
by the user-- each "keystroke"-- to the computer 
immediately. This means that highly responsive 
programs can be written, which examine the user's 
input and can reply instantaneously, if need be, 
after anything Ihe user types. 
IBM-type terminals, however, require a 
"line feed" character or an "end of transmission" 
character to be typed by the user to make it the 
coropuler'a turn. This locks the keyboard so the 
e it. Then the computer must type 
mlock" signal something, ending with its o 
that makes it the person's turn again 
Why thia unwieldy design? Supposedly it 
results from the curious decision, in the design 
of IBM's 360 computer, to make aU devices 
resemble the card reader as far as the computer 
is concerned. Just as the card reader reads 
punched cards till the last one is done, the IBM 
terminal Is designed lo send and receive characters 
until a "finished" condition Is reached. <rW a\.64|T(.i|CC. 
All are ASCII -type unless otherwise noted. 
Note: there are hundreds of types and 
brands of terminals available. These are jus! 
some thoughts.

BEST BUY? The model 38 ASR Teletype 
gives you upper and lower case, and ia otherwise 
similar to the standard model 33. (70 a month from 
RCA Service Company. Data Communications Div. 
(offices in major cities); $15/mo. for Ihe coupler. 
30-day cancellable bul costs $50 to put in, $34 (o 
take out. 
There is a cute terminal lhat behaves just 
like the 33 ASR, but is faster and uses NCR 
pressure paper or a ribbon, interchangeably . 
The Extel Series A teleprinter from Extel Corp.. 
310 Anthony Trail, Northbrook, 111. 60062. 
If you like Selectrics, but went lo go to ASCII, 
there is one weird possibility. 
A firm called Tycom Systems Corporation 
(26 Just Road, Fairfield NY 07006) offers an 
interesting alternative. It happens lhat all Selec-
trlcs (anyway, Model I and Model II) have a seam 
around the midriff at which the typewriter can 
be unscrewed into two sections. Clever Tycom! 
They make a device which fits between, looks to 
the bottom like the top of the Selectric, and looks 
to the top like the bottom. Also, it turns the 
Selectric into a terminal, receiving ASCII codes 
from whatever computer you attach it to and 
causing the computer to type them, or sending out 
what you type to the computer in ASCII. 
Curiously, IBM has given ils blessing to 
this arrangement, meaning you can have this 
sandwich deal done to a Selectric you rent from 
IBM, and serviced under beefed-up IBM mainten­
ance agreements ($72 per year, or S16.50 per hour, 
as of 1970).

The earlier video terminals came with 
dreadful styling, like a 1940s science-fiction 
movie. But as an example of how the market is 
developing, one of the handsomest video terminals 
is the $1300 Mini-Tec from TEC Incorporated. 
9800 North Oracle Road, Tucson. Ariz. 8S704. 
II comes covered with wood-grain contact paper 
and looks very nice. (You should have seen 
their early models.) 
The Hazeltine 1000 video terminal rents 
for$49/mo. on a 1-year contract. LOWER-CASE 
OPTION; modem and coupler apparently not 
included. (Hazeltine, Greenlnwn, NY 11740, 
with offices all over.) 
If you have no objection to ITT. they offer 
u portable video terminal with built-in modem 
and coupler, the Asciscope, for $65/month. 
Supposedly there's a long waiting list. (ITT 
Data Equipment snd Systems Division, Essl Union 
Ave.. East Rutherford , NJ 07073.) 
see Kustom Electronics, inc. (aren't they the 
rock-amp people?), Data Communications Division, 
1010 West Chestnut, Chanute. Kansas G6720. 
They've already set up travelling terminals for 
the mobile constabulary of Kansas City (Mo.) , 
Palm Beach and Nashville. (Communications, 
Jan. 73, ad p. 47.) Now , of course, you'll need 
a whole stationary radio setup to run that... MISCELLANEOUS 
Various firms rent lerminals, some on a 
short-term basis. (Some terminal companies 
are bad news , keeping up their equipment badly 
and offering poor service, so watch it.) 
(The day will come, let's hope it's soon, 
that you can renl a terminal overnight or for a 
weekend like a movie camera. Bul till people 
get a sense of how far and fast things arc moving, 
we'll continue to schlock along haphazardly.) 
Unfortunately rental people are hard to Hnd, 
since they are usually local, and the Yellow Pages 
idiotically lump together every possible form of 
computer sales and service under "Data Processing 
Equipment and Supplies," and few firms further 
specify their business in the listing. 
Here are some names (neither endorsed nor 
criticized): 
Computer Planning i Supply, Chicago

Vardon » Associates, Dallas 
A good outfit, lhat rents both ASCII and 
IBM-type terminals of their own manufacture, is 
Anderson Jacobson Co. (1065 Morse Ave., 
Sunnyvale, Calif. 94086, and major cities). They 
have a 5electric terminal, for instance, which 
rents for about 5100 a month (about the same as 
the standard IBM 2741) but is portable. 
To provide a memory with your ASCII or IBM-
IBM-type terminal, an odd machine called the 
Techtran 4100 (about $1000 from Techtran Indus­
tries, 58U Jefferson Rd. . Rochester, NY 14623) can 
be used for offline storage, it uses a magnetic 
cassette. Here are some things you can do with it; 
type stuff into the Techtran, 
later squirt it to a computer at high speed 
receive stuff from a computer at high speed, 
later type it back automatically on 
the terminal 
type into the Techtran, correct it, and then 
have it typed back automatically--
no computer. 
The question of whether the Techtron can be used 
with the Digi-Log has not been publicly resolved. 
It happens that Anderson Jacobson (above) 
will rent you their 2741-type Selectric terminal, 
wilh a Techtran. for about $220 a month total. 
But they won't rent Ihe Techtran separately . 
A 2741-type Selectric terminal with memory, 
offering these same capabilities, is now available ' 
from IBM! It is the Communicating Mag Card 
Executive (CMC). Since the Mag Card Executive, 
to which they have added the communication 
feature, costs over $200 a month, figure the 
communication feature could cost another $100 
or so monthly , or probably half again as much 
as the Anderson-Jacobson. 
Honeywell (Honeywell Information Systems, 
Wellcsley Hills. Mass.) has recently made 
available a Braille program to be used with 
"standard terminals" in their systems. (This may 
be Ihe adaptation developed at MIT lo do Braille

VIDEO TERMINALS WITHOUT THE VIDEO 
A very hot item right now is a terminal 
called the "Digi-Log"-- actually several different 
models-- available from Dlgi-Log Systems , Inc., 
666 Daviaville Rd., Willow Grove, Ps. 19090. 
This device fits in a briefcase. Basically 
it is a keyboard with a socket for the phone, 
and an antenna wire. You phone the computer, 
drop the phone handset in the slot, and clip ihe 
wire to the antenna of a TV set. Presto! On the 
TV set appears what you and the computer type 
at each other. 
This is especially good for travelling 
salesmen (to communicate with their offices and 
ordering system via time-sharing computer) 
and executives who do computer work from the 
road. Also for people who want to show off 
remote computer systems. 
Disadvantage: only 42 characters per line, 
which is awkward for some things, such as 
programming in Fortran. 
Price; $1200 io $1400. They also lease. al 
rates as low as $40/monlh (3 years). 
Also available on rental, supposedly, from 
Westwood Associates, Inc. , SO Washington Terrace, 
East Orange, NJ 07017. 
Ann Arbor Terminals. Inc. (Ann Arbor, 
Mich.?) is said to offer a similar unit that is 
The equivalent IBM-type terminal-- keyboard, 
coupler and clip to the TV-- is the IPSA-100, 
offered by I.P. Sharp Associates, Inc. (Bridge 
Administration Building, Bridge Plaza, Ogdenaburg, 
NY 13669). Unfortunately it's much larger than 
Ihe Digi-Log-- it comes in a medium-size suitcase 
-- and more expensive ($1700 up). However, 
they offer the APL character-set (see APL under 
"Magic Languages," p'2.2) as an option-- even 
a model with both normal and APL character-sets 
as a switch-selectable option (costs even more). 
Recently , of all things, plans for a do-it-
yourself unit of Ihis type were announced in a 
popular electronics magazine (Don Lancaster, 
"TV Typewriter," Radio-Electronics. Sept. 1973, 
43-52). This does not include Ihe full plans, 
which ore available for $2 from TV TYPEWRITER, 
Radio-Electronics. 45 E. 17th St. . New York. 
NY 10003. 
Supposedly this can be built for "around 
$120"-- probably a deal more - if you are a skilled 
electronics builder or technician. But that looks 
to include a great deal of labor. 
The finished unit holds up to 32 characters 
per line and up lo 16 lines on the screen: a second 
memory can be added, to hold a second alternative 
screenful.

No longer. 
Anyway, no longer necessary. 
Computer systems can now give you action, 
excitement-- and explanations. 
This is done through the magic of the 
TERMINAL. Terminals come in two conspicuous 
flavors (typewriter and screen or "boob tube") 
and also have two less - noticeable divisions 
("Teletype" or "industry" versus "IBM type.") 
Anyway, a terminal is something that 
allows a person and a computer to type at each 
other. 
Now, computers are merely gadgets for 
twiddling information. They no more under­
stand English, or human psychology, than 
puppies can read music. (See "Artificial In­
telligence," p-lVJSl But the computer's prog-
ran can, for instance, direct the computer to 
type out a simple question, and compare the 
user's answer with a simple set of alternative!. 
For example, suppose the user is visiting a hos­
pital. A computer can sign hin in without the 
abrasiveness of a receiving nurse, and with far 
more patience. The following might be a sample 
dialogue. (Here the computer types what's in 
caps, and the use A replies are in lower- case-)

An interactive system of this kind is call­
ed a conversational system,in that it "converses" 
with the user. TKe secret is that the alterna­
tives in the computer program are few and care­
fully worked out beforehand: there are great pit­
falls when there are too many alternatives, as 
when such conversational systems are used for 
teaching (sec pp. \?.xa ).

THE MAGIC OF THE COMPUTER PROGRAM 
The beeic, central magical interior device 
of the computer we Bhall call a program follower • 
A program follower ie an electronic device (usually) 
which reads aymbola specifying operations, carries 
out the step each specifies and goes on to the next. 
Th* program follower reads down the list 
of inatructions in the program, taking each instruction 
in turn and carrying it out before it goes on to 
the next. 
Now, there are program followers that just 
do that and nothing more; they have to stop when 
they get to the end of the list of instructions. 
A true computer, however, can do several 
things more. 
It can Jump back to an earlier point 
in the program and go on from there. Repeating 
the program in this fashion is called a loop. 
It can perform testB on symbols in 
the memory— for instance, to see If a loop 
has been done enough times, or if some other 
part of the job has been finished-- and jump 
to some other program depending on these 
symbols. This iB called a branch. 
Finally, the computer can change 
the information stored in memory. For instance, 
lt can place an answer in a specific part 
of memory. 
WHAT, THEN, IS A (Digital) COMPUTER? 
A device holding stored symbols 
in a changeable memory, 
performing operations on some of those symbols 
in the memory, 
in a sequence specified by other symbols 
in the memory, 
able to change the sequence 
baaed on tests of symbols in the memory, 
and able to change symbols in the memory. 
(For example, do arithmetic and 
store the result in the memory.) 
Rather than try to slip it to you or prove 
it in some fancy way, let's just state baldly: the 
power of auch a machine to do almost anything 
surpasses all previous technical tricks in human 
history. 
HOW CAN A COMPUTER CONTROL 
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS? 
Answer. Different as they may seem, all 
devices are controlled in the same way. Every 
device has an Interface, that ie, its own special 
connection setup, and in this interface are the 
device registers. 
These device registers look the same to the 
computer: the computer program simply moves 
information patterns into them or moves information 
patterns from them to see what they contain. " U\*\uey Tin,, You " 
-"'4 'T' H- ' 
-_k> particular symbolic signals

musical instrument

disk memory 
The computer, being a machine, doean't 
know or care that device register 17 (say) controls 
a hog feeder, or device register 23 (aay) receives 
information from smog detectors. But what you 
choose, in your program, to put Into device register 
17, controls what the hogs eat, and what comes 
into device register 23 will tell your program, 
you hope, about smog conditions. Choosing how 
to handle these things in your program la your 
business. il 
HOW DOES THE LOOP WORK? 
The computer does things over and over 
by changing a stored count, then testing the stored 
count against another number which is what the 
count should get to, and going to the beginning 
if the desired count haB not been reached. This 
is called a loop. Of there's no way it can ever 
get out, that's an endleas loop.) (Actually, the 
program loop is done the same wsy as a program 
branch: IF a certain count has not been reached, 
it branches BACK to the start of the loop.) 
Other things besides programs may be stored 
in the memory. Anything besides programs are 
usually called data. 
The instructions of programs use the data in different 
ways. Some programs use a lot of data. some use 
a little, some don't use any. It is one of the fascinating 
and powerful things about the computer that both 
the instructions of a program. and the data they work 
on, are stored as patterns of bits in the same memory, 
where they can be modified as needed. Indeed, the 
program can modify its own patterns of bits, a very 
important feature. 
WHAT DO PROGRAMS LOOK LIKE? 
In what forms are these programs stored, 
you ask? Well, they are written by people in computer 
languages, which are then stored in some form in 
the computer's fast core memory, where the program 
follower can act on them. But what does a computer 
language look like, you ask? Aha...

ANALOG COMPUTERS DISPOSED OF 
There are two kinds of computers: analog 
and digital. (Also hybrid, meaning a combination.) 
Analog computers are so unimportant compared to 
digital computers that we will polish them off in 
a couple of paragraphs. 
"Analog" is a shortened form of the word 
"analogy." Originally an "analog" computer was 
one that represented something in the real world 
by some other sort of physical enactment-- for 
instance, building a model of an economic system 
with tubes and liquids; this can demonstrate 
Keyneslan economic principles remarkably well. 
However, the term "analog" has come to mean 
almost exclusively pertaining to measurable 
electrical signals, and an "analog computer" is 
a device that creates or modifies measurable 
electric signals. Thus a hi-fi amplifier is an 
analog computer (it multiplies the signal), a music 
synthesizer is an analog computer (it generates 
and reshapes analog signals). Thus the term has 
deteriorated: almost anything with wires is an 
analog computer. 
Analog computers cannot be truly programmed. 
only rewired. 
Analog equipment is useful, important and 
indispensable. But it is simply not in the same 
class with digital computers, henceforth called 
"computers" in this book, which manipulate symbols 
on the basis of changeable symbolic programa. 
"Analog computer" also means any way of 
calculating that involves measuring approximate 
readings, like a alide rule.

Forget what you've ever heard or imagined 
about computers. Just consider this: 
The computer is the most general machine 
man has ever developed. Indeed, it should be 
called the All-Purpose Machine, but isn't, for 
reasons of historical accident (see nearby). 
Computers can control, and receive information 
from, virtually any other machine. The computer 
is not like a bomb or a gun, which can only des­
troy, but more like a typewriter, wholly non­
committal between good and bad in its nature. 
The scope of what computers can do is breath­
taking. Illustrated are some examples (although 
having all this happen on one computer would be 
unusual). It can turn things on and off, ring 
bells, put out fires, type out on printing machines. 
Computers are incredibly dogged. Computers 
can do things repeatedly forever, or an exact, 
immense number of times (like 4,901,223) , doing 
something over and over, depending on whether 
it's finished or not. A computer's activities 
can be combined in remarkable ways. One activity, 
repeated over and over, can be part of another 
activity repeated over and over, which can be 
a part of still another activity, which can be 
repeated ad infinitum. THERE ARE DEFINITE 
LIMITATIONS on what computers can do, but 
they are not easy to describe briefly. Also, some 
of them are argued about among computer people. 
Xt tun **U 1* AU-piWse Mctykje 
Computers are COMPLETELY GENERAL, 
with no fixed purpose or style of operation. 
In spite of this , the strange myth has evolved 
that computers are somehow "mathematical." 
Actually von Neumann, who got the general 
idea about as soon as anybody (1940s), called 
the computer 
THE ALL-PURPOSE MACHINE. 
(Indeed, the first backer of computers after World 
War II was a maker of multi-lightbulb signs. It 
is an interesting possibility that if he had not 
been killed in an airplane crash, computers 
would have been seen first as text-handling and 
picture-making machines, and only later developed 
for mathematics and business.) 
We would call it the All-purpose Machine 
here, except that for historical reasons it has 
been slapped with the other name. 
But that doesn't mean it has a fixed way 
of operating. On the contrary. 
COMPUTERS HAVE NO NATURE 
AND NO CHARACTER, 
save that which has been put into them by whoever 
is creating the program for a particular purpose. 
Computers are, unlike any other piece of equipment, 
perfectly BLANK . And that is how we have projected 
on it so many different faces.

Cybercrud is not aimed only at laymen. 
It can work even among insiders. 
The operations manager of a national 
timesharing service, for example, was fanatical 
about cleanliness. In order to assure a Clean 
Computer Room, he said, and hence no dangerous 
dust near the tapes or disks , he made a rule 
requiring that anyone entering the computer room 
had to wear cloth booties over his shoes. 
Booties were hung outside for those who 
had to enter. 
"And 1 had the greatest time making his." 
says his wife, laughing. "With the cutest little 
bunny faces on them. The buttons were the 
hardest part to get - you know, the ones with 
eyes that roll!" She laughs very hard as she 
tells this. 
"Of course there was no need for it." he 
now chortles, "but it sure kept people out of the 
computer room." 
(That's applied logic for you.) 
COMPUTERS 
AND THEIR PRIESTS 
First get it through your head that computers are big, 
expensive, fast, dumb adding-machine-typewriters. Then 
realize that most of the computer technicians that you're 
likely to meet or hire are complicators, not simpiifiers. 
They're trying to make it look tough. Not easy. They're 
building a mystique, a priesthood, their own mumbo-
jumbo ritual to keep you from knowing what they-- and 
you-- are doing," 
-- Robert Townsend, 
Up The Organization (Knopf), p. 36. 
Outsiders arc often prey to cybercrud Ihey 
dream up themselves. I once knew a college 
registrar's office where they had been getting 
along fine for years with paper forms. The year 
before the computer was slated to arrive, they 
started using file cards filled out by hand, instead. 
Why? "Well, we thought that would make it easier 
for the computer. Computers use cards, don't they?1 
Note that referring to a computer as if it were 
a living creature is not cybercrud; to say that a 
program "looks at" a device, "tries to" effect a 
procedure, and "goes to sleep," are all colorful 
brief ways of describing what really happens.

THE GREAT GAME OF 
TECHNOLOGICAL PRETENSE 
that haa the whole world in its grasp. 
4 Public thinking about computers is heavily 
tinged by a peculiar image which we may call the 
Myth of the Machine. It goes as follows: there is 
something called the Machine, which is Taking Over 
The World. According to this poinl of view 
The Machine Is a relentless, peremptory, repetitive, 
invariable, monotonous, inexorable, implacable, 
ruthless, inhuman, dehumanizing, impersonal 
Juggernaut, brainlessly carrying out repetitive 
(and often violent) actions. Symbolic of this 
is of course Charlie Chaplin, dodging the relent­
less, repetitive, monotonous, implacable, 
dehumanizing gears of a machine he must deal with 
in the film Modern Times. 
Ordinarily this view of The Machine is 
contrasted with an idea of a Warm Human Being, 
usually an idealized version of the person thinking 
these thoughts. 
Warm 
Human 
Being 
But consider something. The model often 
goes further than this. The Machine is cold, the 
Human Being cmotionai and warm. Yet there is 
such a thing as being too emotional and warm. 
There is in fact a third type in the schema, the 
being who goes too far on the same scale. Strangely, 
he has at least three different names, though the 
picture of him is abstractly the same: 
x 
The 
Machine Warm 
Human 
Being "Bum" 
''Nigger" 
"Hippie" 
Now, "bums." "niggers" and "hippies" are 
not real people. The words are derogatory slang 
for the destitute, for persons with any African 
ancestry, and for people dressing in certain styles. 
But the remarkable thing about the slang is that 
ull three of these derogatory terms seem to have 
the same connotation in our culture: someone who 
is dirty, lazy and lascivious. In other words, 
whatever distinguishes The Machine from the 
Warm Human Being is carried too far by the bunch 
at the other end. 
In other words, this conceptual continuum 
is a single, fundamental scale in our culture: 
why is unclear. Since most people consider 
themselves-- naturally!-- to be in the middle 
category, it acts as a sort of reference continuum 
of two bad things on either side. 
It also has another effect: it supplies a 
derogatory way of seeing. On the right-hand side, 
it allows many Americans not to see, or to see 
only with disgusl, the destitute and those with 
African ancestry and those dressing in hippie style. 
But this book isn't about that. 
The left side of the continuum is our present 
concern. There, too. people refuse to see. What 
people mainly refuse to see is that machines in 
general aren't like that, relentless, repetitive, 
monotonous, implacable, dehumanizing. Oh, there 
are some machines like thai, particularly the 
automobile assembly line. But the nssembly line 
was designed the way it is because it gets the most 
work out of people. It gets the work it does out of 
people by the way it exerts pressure. 
So here we see the same old trick: people 
building a system and saying it has to work that way 
because it's a machine, rather than because that's 
how 1 designed it. 
isider 
The automobile is a machine, but it is hardly 
the repetitive, "dehumanized" thing we usually 
hear about. It goes uphill, downhill, left and right, 
fast and slow. It may be decorated. II Is the scene 
of many warm human activities. And moat impor­
tantly , automobiles are very much the extension of 
their owners. exemplifying life-style, personality, 
and ideology. Consider the Haja Buggy Volkswagen 
and the ostentatious cushy Cadillac. Consider the 
dashboard ornament and the bumper sticker. 
The Machine, indeed. 
The camera is a machine, but one that allows 
Its user to freeze and preserve the views and images 
of the world he wants. 
The bicycle is a machine, bul one that brings 
you into personal and non-polluting contact with 
nature, or at least that stylized kind of nature 
acceaaible to bicycle paths. To sum up, then. The Machine is a myth. 
The bad things in our society are the 
products of bad systems, bad decisions 
and conceivably bad people, in various 
combinations. Machines per ac are 
essentially neutral, though some machines 
can be built which are bad indeed, 
such as bombs, guns and death-camps. 
The myth of The Machine la a curious aspect 
of our ideology. Is it especially 
American, or world-wide? 
If we ignore this myth we can see each possible 
machine or system for what it is, and 
study how it ties In with human life 
for good or ill, fostering or lousing up 
such things as the good life, preser­
vation of species, love Snd self-respect. 
"The computer ia the ultimate Rorschach 
test," Freed Bales said lo me twelve years ago. 
Dr. Bales, a Harvard psychologist, was somewhat 
perturbed by the papers he was getting in his 
seminar on computer modelling in Ihe social 
sciences. Somewhat nutty people in Ihe seminar 
were writing somewhat nutty papers for him. 
And truer words were never spoken. On 
this point I find Bales has been terribly, terribly 
right. The computer is an incredible projective 
test: what you see in the computer comes right off 
the back wall of your psyche. In over a decade 
in the field I have not ceased to marvel at the way 
people's personalities entwine with the computer, 
each making it his own-- or rejecting it-- in his 
own, often unique and peculiar way, deeply re­
flecting his concerns and what is in his heart. 
Yes, odd people are attracted lo the computer, 
and the bonds that hold them are not those of 
casual interest. 
In fact, people tend to identify with it. 
In this light we may consider the often-
heard remarks about computers being rigid, 
narrow, and inflexible. This is of course true in 
a sense, but the fact lhat some people stress it 
over and over is an important clue to something 
about them. My own impression is that the people 
who stress this aspect are the comparatively rigid, 
narrow and inflexible people. 
Other computer experts, no less worthy, 
tell us the computer is a supertoy, the grandest 
play machine ever to be discovered. These 
people tend to be the more outgoing, generous 
and playful types. 
In a classic study, psychiatrist Bruno 
Bettclheim examined a child who thought he was 
a machine, who talked in staccato monosyllables, 
walked jerkily and decorated the side of his bed 
with gears. We will not discuss here the prob­
able origins and cure of this complex; but we 
must consider that identifying with machines is 
a crucial cultural (heme in American society, 
an uvailublc theme for all of us. And It well may 
be thai computer people are partaking of this same 
self-image: in a more benign form, perhaps, a 
shift of gears (as it were) from Bettelheim's 
mechanical child, but still c i (he sume track. 
Some of the computer high-'chool kids I've 
known, because of their youth, have been even 
more upfront about this lhan udults. 
1 know one boy, for instance, whose dream 
was to put a 33ASR Teletype on wheels under 
radio control, and alarm people ut the computer 
conference by having it roll up to them and clatter 
out questions impersonally. (If you knew the kid 
-- aloof and haughty-seeming- you might Ihink 
that's how he approaches people in real life.) 
1 know a high-school boy (not a computer 
expert) who programmed a computer lo type out 
a love story, using the BASIC "print" command, 
the only one he knew. He could not bring 
himself to write the love story on paper. 
The best example I can think of. though, 
took place at the kids' booth (see p. 97) at a 
computer conference. One of the more withdrawn 
girls was sitting at an off-line video terminal, 
idly typing things onto the screen. When she 
had gone a sentence remained. 11 said: 
1 love you all, bul at a distance.

(On the other side of Ihis book, Dream 
Machines, we will curry this mailer further. 
The most exciting thinga in the computer field 
are coming from people trying to realize their 
wildest dreams by computer: artificial intel­
ligence, computer music, computer picture-
making and so on.)

for coining the term "cybercrud." which I define 
as "putting things over on people using computers.' 
But as long as it goes on we'll need the word. At 
every corner of our society, people are issuing 
pronouncements and making other people do things 
and saying it's because of the computer. The 
function of cybercrud is thus to confuse, intimi­
date or pressure. We hsve all got to get wise to 
this if it is going to be curtailed. 
Cybercrud takes numerous forms. All of 
them, however, share the patina of "science" that 
computers have for the layman. 
la) COMPUTER AS MAGIC WORD 
The most delicate, and seemingly innocent, 
technique is the practice of naming things so as 
spuriously to suggest that they involve computers. 
Thus there is a manufacturer of pot-pipes with 
"Data" in its name, and apparently a pornography 
house with a "Cyber-". 
lb) COMPUTER AS MAGIC INGREDIENT 
The above seems silly, but it is no less silly 
than talking about "computer predictions" and 
"computer studies" of things. The mere fsct that 
a computer is_ involved in something has no bearing 
on its character or validity. The way things are 
done with computers affects their character and 
validity, just like the way things are done without 
computers. (Indeed, merely using a computer 
often has no bearing on the way things are done.) 
Thia same technique is easily magnified to 
suggest, not merely that something involves 
computers, but is wholly done by computers. The 
word "computerize" performs this fatal function. 
When used specifically, as in computerize the 
billing operation, it can be fairly clear; but make 
it vague, as in computerize the office, and it can 
mean anything. 
"Fully computerize" is worse. Thus we hear 
about a "fully computerized" print shop, which 
turns out to be one whose computers do the type­
setting; but they could also run the presses, pay 
the bills and work the coffee machine. For prac­
tical purposes, there is no such thing as "fully" 
computerized. There is always one more thing 
computers could do. 
BY THL AID OF THE MIRROR SHE PUT ON THL HEAD 
2) WHITE LIES: THE COMPUTER MADE ME DO IT 
Next come all the leetle white lies about how 
such-and-auch ia the computer's fault and not 
your decision. Thus the computer is made a 
General Scapegoat at the name time it's covering up 
for what somebody wants to do anyway . 
"It has to be thia way." 
"There's nothing we can do; this ia all 
handled by computer." 
"The computer will not allow thia." 
"The computer won't let ua." 
The translation is, of courae, THE STINKY LOUSY 
PROGRAM DOES NOT PERMIT IT. Which means in 
turn: WE DO NOT CHOOSE TO PROVIDE. IN OUR 
PROGRAMS AND EQUIPMENT. ANY ALTERNATIVES. 
Now. it is often the case that good and 
sufficient reason exists for the way things are done. 
But it is also often the caae that companies and the 
public are inconvenienced, or worse, by decisions 
the computer people make and than hide with their 
claim of technical necessity. (See p.^L: Dealing 
with computer people.) 3) YAGOTTAS: COMPUTER AS COERCER 
More aggressively, cybercrud is a technique 
for making people do what you want. "The com­
puter requires it," you say , and so people can be 
made to hand over personal information, secretaries 
can be intimidated into scouring the files, payment 
schedules can be artificially enforced. 
THE GENERAL STATUS TRICK 
Status tricks, combining the putdown and 
the self-boost, date back to times immemorial. 
But today they take new forms. The biggest trick 
is to elevate yourself and demean the listener at 
the seme time, or, more generally, the technique 
is making people feel stupid while acting like a 
big cheese. Thus someoneone might say , 
"People must begin to get used to the objec­
tive scientific ways of doing things 
that computers now make necessary." 
But the translation seems to be: 
"People must get used to the inflexible, 
badly thought out, inconvenient and 
unkind systems that I and other 
self-righteous individuals and com­
panies are inflicting on the world." 
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GOTTA 
The uninformed are bulldozed, and even 
the informed are pressured, by the foolish myths 
of the clever, implacable and scientific computer 
to which they must adapt. People are told they 
have to "relate to the computer." But actually 
they are being made to relate to systems humans 
have designed around it, in much the same way 
a sword dance is designed around the sword. 
When establishment computer people say 
that the computer requires you to be systematic, 
they generally mean you huve lo learn their system. 
But anyone who tells you a method "has to be 
changed for the computer" is usually fibbing. 
He prefers to change the method for the computer. 
The reasons may be bad or good. Often the 
computer salesman or indoctrinator will present 
as "scientific" techniques which were doped out 
or whomped up by a couple of guys in the back 
room. "If it can't be done in COBOL, 
I Just tell people it can't be done by computer. 
It saves a lot of trouble." 
Attributed to somebody in Rochester. 
(See COBOL, p 7) I -) 
St.;* 
In the movie "Fail-Safe." they showed you 
lots of fake tape drives with the reels constantly 
turning in one direction. This they called a 
"computer." Calling any sinister box "a computer" 
is a widespread trick. Gives people the willies. 
Keeps 'em in line. 
Here is an example, as told to me. A friend 
of mine worked in a dress factory where they had 
a perfectly good system for billing and bookkeeping. 
Customers were listed by name and kept in alpha­
betical order. The fast pace of the garment indus­
try meant that companies often changed names, and 
so various companies had a number of different 
names in the file. This bothered nobody because 
the people understood the system. 
Then management bought a small computer, 
never mind what brand, and hired a couple of guys 
to come in and put the bookkeeping system on it. 
Still okay. Indeed, small programming firms 
con sometimes do this sort of thing very well, 
because ihey can work flexibly with the people 
and don't necessarily feel committed to making it 
work a certain way . 
Well, this was a nice instance where the 
existing system could have been exactly trans­
ferred lo the computer. The fact thai some custom­
ers had several names would certainly have been 
no problem; a program could have been written 
that allowed users to type any acceptable customer 
name, causing the computer to look up the correct 
account (and if desired, print its usual name and 
ask for verification). 
But no. The guys did not answer employees' 
questions comprehensibly, nor did they want sug­
gestions. They immediately decreed that since 
computers only worked with numbers (a fib. but 
a convenience to them), every customer would 
thenceforth have lo be referred to by number. 
After that the firm had nothing but Iroubie, 
through confusion over the multiple names, and 
my friend predicted that this would destroy the 
company. I haven't heard the outcome. 
This story is not necessarily very inter­
esting; it merely happened. It's not s made-up 
example. 
Moral: until we overthrow the myth that 
people always have to adapt to computers, rather 
than the other way around, things will never go 
right. Adaptations should take place on both 
sides, darn it. *rtrj

They'll believe such a box is anything you tell them. 
EVERYBODY DOES IT 
Cybercrud is by no means the province of 
computer people alone. Business manipulators 
and bureaucrats have quickly learned the tricks. 
Companies do it to the public. The press, Indeed, 
contributes (see Suggestions for Writers and 
Spokesmen, p. ). But the computer people are 
best at it because they have more technicalities 
to shuffle around magically; they can put anybody 
down. 
Now , computer people do deaerve respect. 
So many things that people do with computers are 
hard. It can be understood that they want to be 
appreciated, and if not for the particulars, for 
the machismo (mschinismo?) of coping with intri­
cacy . But that is no excuse for keeping others In 
controlled ignorance. No man has a right to be 
proud that he is preserving and manipulating 
the ignorance of others. 1) to manipulate situations. 
2) to control others . 
3) to fool. 
4) lo look like hot stuff. 
5) lo keep outsiders from seeing through something. 
6) to sell something. 
7) to put someone down . 
8) to conceal. 
9) general secretiveness. 
10) low expectation of others' mentality. 
11) seeking to be the broker and middleman for 
all relations with the computer. 
12) vagueness sounds profound. 
13) you don't have to show what you're not sure of. 
14) your public image is monolithic. 
15) you really don't know.

THE MAIN COMPUTER ORGANIZATIONS 
ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery. 
This is the main computer professional 
society; the title only has meaning histor­
ically, as many members are concerned not 
with machinery itself, but with software, 
languages, theories and soon. 
If you have any plans to stick with 
the subject, membership in the Association 
for Computing Machinery is highly recom­
mended. ACM calls itself "The Society of 
the Computing Community." Thus it properly 
embraces both professionals and fans. 
Dues for official students are $8 a yeai 
$35 for others, which includes a subscription 
to Communications of the ACM, the official 
mag. Their address for memberships and 
magazines is ACM, P.O. Box 12105, 
Church St. Station, New York, NY 10249. 
(The actual ACM HQ is at 1133 Ave. of the 
Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036.) 
They have stacked the deck so that 
if you want to subscribe to any ACM maga­
zines you'd better join anyway . Here are 
the year prices: 
Member 
Communications of the ACM free 
Computing Surveys $7 
Computing Reviews $12.50 
Journal of the ACM $7 
The one drawback to joining the ACM 
is all the doggoned mailing lists it gets you 
on. It's unclear whether there's anything 
you can do to prevent this, but there oughta 
be. 
SIGs and SICs. For ACM members 
with special interests (and we all have them), 
the ACM contains subdivisions-- clubs within 
the club, of people who keep in touch to 
share their interests. These are called SICs 
(Special Interest Committees) and SIGs 
(Special Interest Groups). There are such 
clubs-- SICs and SIGs-- in numerous areas, 
including Programming Languages, Computer 
Usage in Education, etc. Encouraging these 
subinterests to stay within ACM saves a lot 
of trouble for everybody and keeps ACM the 
central society, 
AFIPS. 
AFIPS is the UN of computing. They 
sponsored the Joints, and now sponsor the 
NCC . Just as individuals can't join the UN, 
they can't join AFIPS, which stands for 
American Federation of Information Proces­
sing Societies. Depending on your special 
interests, though, you can join a member 
society. 
The constituent societies of AFIPS are, 
as of June 1973: (If any turn you on, write 
AFIPS for addresses: AFIPS, 210 Summit Ave. 
Montvale NJ 07645.) 
^5"ACM: the Association for Computing Machinery. 
IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers. This is the professional society 
of electronics guys. 
Simulation Councils. This is the professional 
society for those interested in Simulation 
(see p.TiK). 
Association for Computational Linguistics . (Where 
language and computer types gather.) 
American Association of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics. 
American Statistical Association. 
Instrument Society of America. 
Society for Information Display. (See flip side.) 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
American Society for Information Science. (This 
group is mainly for electronified librarians 
and information retrieval types-- see 
flip side.) 
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 
Special Libraries Association. 
Association for Educational Data Systems. 
IFIP. This is the international computer society. 
Like AFIPS, its members are societies, so 
joining ACM makes you an IFIP participant. 
IFIP holds conferences around the 
world. Fun. Expense. CONFERENCES. 
Conferences in any field are exciting, at least 
till you reach a certain degree of boredom with the 
field. Computer conferences have their own heady 
atmosphere, compounded of a sense of elitism, of 
being in the witches' cauldron, and the sure sense 
of the impact everything you see will have as it all 
grows and grows. Plus you get to look at gadgets. 
Usually to go for one day doesn't cost much, 
and at the bigger ones you get lots of free literature, 
have salesmen explain their things to you, see 
movies, hear fascinating (sometimes) speakers. 
THE JOINTS! The principal computer confer­
ences have always been the Spring Joint 
Computer Conference, held in an 
astern city in May, and the Fall Joint 
Computer Conference, held in a Western 
city in November (the infamous Spring 
Joint and Fall Joint, or SJCC and FJCC). 
In 1973, because of poor business the 
previous year, the two were collapsed 
into one National Computer Conference 
(NCC) in June (Universal Joint?) The 
Joints have always been sponsored by 
AFIPS (see below). The National 
Computer Conference will henceforth 
be annual, at least for a while. 
The cost of attending is high--
while it's just a couple of dollars to 
look at the exhibits, this rises to 
perhaps fifteen dollars to go to the day's 
technical sessions or fifty for the week 
(not counting lodging and eats)-- but 
it's very much worth it. The lower age 
limit for attendees is something like 
twelve, unfortunately for those 
with interested children. 
Other important conferences: the annual ACM 
conference in the summer; BEMA 
(Business Equipment Mfrs. Assn.) 
in the fall and spring (no theory, but 
lots of gadgets); and other conferencs 
on special subjects, held all the time 
all over. Lists of conferences and 
their whereabouts are in most of the 
magazines; Communications of the ACM 
and Computer Design have the biggest 
lists. CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS ft?** *' p"c.AO\fc5/ \ f>e?t Sjc-c-Wj ' » 
As you may know, conferences largely con­
sist of separate "sessions" in which different people 
talk on specific topics, usually reading out loud from 
their notes and showing slides. 
Conference proceedings are books which 
result Trom conferences. Supposedly they contain 
what each guy said; in practice people say one thing 
and publish another, more formal than the actual 
presentation. 
This leads to a curious phenomenon at the 
main computer conferences (SJCC.FJCC. ACM and 
now NCC). When you register they give you a book 
(you're actually paying perhaps $15 for it), contain­
ing all the papers that are about to be given, nicely 
tricked out by their authors. If you rush to a corner 
and look at the book it may change your notion of 
which sessions to go to. 
Anyway, the resulting volumes of conference 
proceedings are a treasure trove of interesting papers 
on an immense variety of computerish and not-so-
computerish subjects. Great for browsing. 
Expensive but wonderful. (Horrible when you're 
moving, though, as they are big and heavy.) 
JOINT PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings for the 
Spring Joint and Fall Joint, from the 
fifties to 1972, are available from AFIPS 
Press , as are proceedings of the 1973 
NCC. (AFIPS Press, 210 Summit Avenue, 
Montvale NJ 07645.) They cost $20-26 
each after the conference is over; less 
in microfilm. (At the Joint Conferences, 
AFIPS Press often gives discounts, at 
their booth, on back Joint proceedings.) 
£^>If you want to spend money to 
learn about the field. Proceedings of 
the Joint Conferences are a fine buy. 
Back ACM Proceedings. From the ACM. 
Other Proceedings. Often sold at counters at 
conferences. Or available from various 
publishers. Join the ACM and you'll 
find out soon enough . 
TRY TO GET TO THE NATIONAL JOINT. Just as 
every Muslim should go to Mecca, every 
computer fan should go to a National Joint 
(National Computer Conference, or NCC). 
The next two are (check the magazines): 
May 1974, Chicago 
May 1975 rSan Fganoisgo- A WA H E-1M, 
NO QUALIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED . Think of it 
as a circus for smart alecks, or, if you 
prefer, a Deep Educational Experience. 
VdHiir hVfwp if "fvuTMce cphwc*. 
There is a lot of talk about "best" ways of teaching about computers, but in most places 
the actual alternatives open to those who want to learn are fairly dismal. 
Universities. Universities and colleges tend to teach computing with a mathematical 
emphasis at the start. Indeed, most seem to require that to get into the introductory computer 
course, you must have had higher math (at least calculus. sometimes matrix algebra as well). 
This is preposterous, like requiring an engineering degree to drive a car. (Gradeschool kids 
can learn to program with no prerequisites.) • 
t>lt seems to be to cut down enrollment, since they're not set up to deal with all those 
people who want to learn about computers. (And why not?) Also it's a status thing; as if 
this restriction somehow should keep enrollment to students with "logical minds." whatever 
those are, or "mathematical sophistication ," as if that were relevant. 
"Computer schools," community and commercial colleges, on the other hand, tend to 
prepare students only for the most humdrum business applications-- keypunching (which is 
rapidly becoming obsolete), and programming in the COBOL language on IBM business systems. 
This gets you no closer to the more exciting applications of computers than you were originally. 
Some experimental trends are more encouraging. Some colleges, for instance, offer 
"computer appreciation courses," with a wider introduction to what's available and more varied 
programming intended to serve as an introduction to this wider horizon. 
Highschool courses seem to be cutting through the junk and offering students access to 
minicomputers with quickie languages, usually BASIC. Both Digital Equipment Corp. and 
Hewlett-Packard seem to be making Inroads here. 
Kiddie setups, rumored to exist in Boston and San Francisco, are geared to letting 
grade-school children see and play with computers. Also one company (General Turtle, see 
p.kV/) is selling computer toys intended to encourage actual programming by children.

BUMMERS 
This is perhaps a minority view, but I think 
any introduction to computers which makes them 
seem intrinsically mathematical is misleading. 
Historically they began as mathematical, but now 
this is simply the wrong way to think about them. 
Same goes for emphasizing business uses as if 
that were all. 
We will not name here any of the various 
disagreeable pamphlets and books which stress 
these aspects and don't make things very clear. 
tJJ>VBOUT FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS. Many of the 
magazines are free to "qualified" readers, usually 
those willing to state on a signed form that they 
influence the purchase of computers, computer ser­
vices , punch cards, or the like. (They ask other 
questions on the form, but whether you influence 
purchase is usually what decides whether they 
sci.d you the magazine.) It is also helpful to have 
a good-sounding title or company affiliation. 
k BINGO CARDS. 
These are little postcards you find in all the 
agazines except the ACM and company ones. Fill 
1 in your name and an attractive title ("Systems 
/Consultant" or "consultant" is good-- after all, 
someday someone may ask your advice) and circle 
the numbers corresponding to the ads that entice 
you. You'll be flooded with interesting, expensively 
printed, colorful, educational material on different 
people's computers and accessories. And note that 
enders don't lose: any company wants its products 
known. 
However, a postoffice box is good, as it helps 
to avoid calls at home from salesmen, wasting their 
\ time as much as yours. If you arc in a rural-type 
\ area where you can assume a company name with no 
k legal difficulties, so much the better. 
"Cloven fbfs"- h JWtfs-
A number of inexpensive gadgets purport to 
teach you computer principles. Many people have been 
disappointed, or worse, made to feel stupid, when they 
learn nothing from these. Actually the best these things 
really can do is give you an idea of what con be done 
with combinations of switches. From that to learning 
what computer people really think about is a long, long 
way. 
I That ihe field hus run boon popularized by its 
better writers may simply come from an honest doub. 
that ordinary people can understand computers. 
1 dispute that. Through magazines, millions 
of Americans have learned about photography. Through 
the popular sciencc-and-mcchanics type magazines, 
and more recently the electronics magazines, various 
other technical subjects have become widely understood. 
So far nobody has opened up computers. This 
is a first attempt. If this book won't do it another one 
will. 
And you better believe that Popular Computers 
magazine is not very far oway. Soon a fully-loaded 
minicomputer will cost loss than ihe best hi-fi sets. 
In a couple of years, thousands of individuals will 
own computers, and millions more will want to. Look 
out. here we go.

y\ipecT> OF TW $t»K 
People ask me often where they can learn 
about "science." As in all fields, maga­
zines are usually the best sources of 
general orientation. 
Science Digest is kind of helpful for a atart, 
although unfortunately they print summaries 
of every fool study that generalizes to the 
hearts of all humanity from two dozen Iowa

Scientific American is the favorite. Some stuff 
is hard to read but some,isn't; the pic­
tures and diagrams are terrific. 
Science k Technology magazine seems to me 
one of the better ones-- breezy, informa­
tive, not trivial. 
Science magazine is read by most actual scien­
tists, and if you have a lively curiosity 
and can guess at the meanings'of words, 
will tell you an incredible amount, (This 
is a main source for the science articles 
in the New York Times, which in turn...) 
Their articles on politics of science, and 
the future, are very interesting, important, 
and depressing. You have to join Am. Assn.

Daniel S. Greenberg's Science and Government 
Report (sorry— $35 a year) is what really 
tells it. Greenberg is the man who knows, 
both what is shaping up in science and 
the insane governmental confusions and 
floundering responses and grandstanding 
and pork-barrel initiatives... 
Greenberg is, incidentally, one of 
the finest writers of our time and a great 
humorist.

This is the wall that the handwriting 
is on. The explanations— not yet fully debugged— are 
intended for anybody. The listings of expensive products 
and services are intended not only as corroborative detail, 
for a general sense of what's available, but also for 
business people who might find them helpful, for affluent 
individuals and c.lubs who want to try their hand, and 
finally as a box score of how the prices are coming down. 
Because we are all going to be able to afford these things 
pretty soon.

This diagram shows the amazing and unique way prices 
drop in the computer field. The prices shown are for the first 
minicomputer, the PDP-5 (and its hugely popular offspring, the 
PDP-8); but the principle has held throughout the field, and the 
downward trend will probably accelerate due to the new big 
integrated circuits. 
Another example: an IBM 7090, a very decent million-dollar 
computer in 1960, was put up for sale at a modish Parke-Bernet 
"used computer auction" in 1970. If I remember aright, they 
could not get a $1000 bid, because today's machines are so much 
smaller, faster and more dependable.

Everywhere in the world people can pretend 
that your ignorance. or position. or credentials. or 
poverty. or general unworthiness, are the reasons 
you are being pushed around or made to feel small. 
And because you can't tell, you have to take it. 
And of course we can do the same thing with 
computera. Yea. we can do it in spades. (See 
"Cybercrud." p. S.) But many of us do not want to. 
There has to be a better way. There haa to be a

"WHoee irs AT 
Computers are where it's at. 
Recently a bank employee was accused of 
embezzling a million and a half dollars by clever 
computer programming. His programs shifted 
funds from hundreds of people's accounts to his 
own. but apparently kept things looking innocent 
by clever programming tricks. According to the 
papers, the program kept up appearances by 
redepositing the stolen amount in each account just 
as interest payments were about to be calculated, 
then withdrawing it again just after. ("Chief 
Teller Is Accused of Theft of $1.5 Million at a Bank 
Here." New York Times, 23 March 73, p. 1.) 
The alleged embezzlement was discovered, not by 
bank audit, but by records found on the premises 
of a raided bookmaker. 
In B recent scandal that has rocked the 
insurance world, an insurance company appears 
to have generated thousands of fictitious customers 
and accounts by computer, then bilked other 
insurance companies— those who re-Insured the 
original fictitious policies— by fictitious claims 
on the fictitious misfortunes of the fictitious 
policy-holders. 
In April of 1973. according to the Chicago 
radio, s burglary ring had a "computerized" list 
of a thousand proapective victims. 
There have been instances where dishonest 
university students, nevertheless able programmers, 
were able to change their course grades, stored 
on a central university computer. 
It is not unheard of for ace programmers to 
create gram} incomprehensible systems that run 
whole companies, systems they can personally play 
like a piano, ind then blackmail their firms. 
A friend of a friend of the author ia an see 
programmer at ths Pentagon, supposedly a private 
supervising colonels. On daya he is mad at his 
boss, he says, the army cannot find out ita strength 
within 300,000 men. Or three million if he so 
chooses. 
This awkward Btste of affairs, obviously 
spanning both the American continent and most 
realms of endeavor, haa come about for various 
reasons. 
First, the climate of uncomprehension leads 
men in management to treat computer matters as 
"mere technicalities"-- a myth aa sinister aa the 
public notion that computers are "scientific"— 
and abandon the kind of scrutiny they sensibly 
apply to any other company activities. 
Second, moat of today's computer syatems are 
Inherently Usky and insecure-- and likely to stay 
that way awhile. Getting things to work on them 
involves giving people extraordinary and invisible 
powers. (Eventually thla will change, but watch 
out for the meantime.) The obvious consequence is simply for the 
computer people to be allowed to take over 
altogether. It may Indeed be that computer people 
-- the more well-informed and visionary ones, 
anyway-- can see the farthest, and appreciate 
most deeply the better ways things can go, and 
the steps that have to be taken to get there. (And 
Boards of Managers can at least be partially assured 
that hanky-panky at the lower levels will be 
prevented, if men in charge know where the bodies 
are buried. > 
That seems to be how it's going. Examples: 
The president of Dartmouth College, John 
Kemeny, is a respected computerman and a devel­
oper of one of the important computing languages, 
BASIC (aee p. I£ ). 
The new president of the Russell Sage Foun­
dation, Hugh Cline, used to teach computing at 
Columbia. 
It's probably the same in industry. In other 
words, more and more, for better and for worse, 
things are being run by people who know how to 
use computers, and this trend is probably irre­
versible . 
In some ways, of course, this is a sinister 
portent. In private industry it's not so bad, 
since the danger is more of embezzlement and 
botch-up than of public menace. But then there's 
the problem of the government. The men who 
manage the information tools are more and more 
in charge of government, too. And if we can have 
a Watergate without computers, just wait. (See 
"Burning Issues," p. $"£) 
The way to defend ourselves against computer 
people is to become computer people ourselves. 
Which of course is the point. We must all become 
computer people, at least to the extent that we have 
already become Automobile People and Camera 
People— that is, informed enough to tell when one 
goes by or when someone points one at you. 
MANY MANSIONS 
The future is going to be full of computers, 
for good or ill. Many computer systems are being 
prepared by a variety of lunatics, idealists and 
dreamers, as well as profit-hungry companies and 
unimaginative clods, all for the benefit of mankind. 
Which ones will work and which ones we will like is 
another matter. The grand and dreamy ones bid fair 
to reorganize drastically the lives of mankind. 
For instance, Doug Engelbart at Stanford 
Research Institute has a beautiful system, called NLS, 
that will allow us to use computers as a generalized 
postoffice and publication system. From your com­
puter terminal you juBt sign onto Engelbart's System, 
and you're st once in touch with lots of writings by 
other subscribers, which you may call to your 
screen and write replies to. 
(These grander and dreamier applications are 
discussed on the other side of this book.) 
But the plain computer visions are grand 
enough. 
The great world of time-sharing, for instance. 
("Time-sharing" means that the computer's time is 
shared by a variety of users simultaneously. See 
p. "/?.) If you have an account on a time-sharing 
computer, you can sign on from your terminal 
(see p. / <j) over any telephone, no matter where 
you are, and at once do anything that particular 
computer allows— calling up programs in a variety 
of computer languages, dipping into data on a 
variety of subjects as easily as one now consults 
a chart. 
For inatance, at Dartmouth College— where 
time-sharing is perhaps farthest advanced aa a 
way of life— the user (any Dartmouth student, for 
instance) can juBt sit down at a terminal and write 
a simple program (in Dartmouth's BASIC language, 
for instance) to analyze census data. Since Dart­
mouth has a complete file on its time-sharing system 
of the detailed sample from the 1970 census, the 
program can buzz through that and report almost 
immediately the numbers of divorced Aleuts or 
boy millionaires in the sample, or (more signifi­
cantly) the relative incomes of different ethnic 
groups when categorized according to the ques­
tioner's interests. 
But simple time-sharing is only the beginning. 
Networks of computers are now coming Into being. 
Most significant of theae ia the ARPANET (financed 
by ARPA, the Defense Department's Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, It is nonetheless non-
military in character). Dozens of large time-sharing 
computers around the country are being tied into the 
Arpanet, and a user of any of these can reach dir­
ectly Into the other computers of the network— 
uaing their programa, data or other facilities. 
Arpanet enthusiasts see this aa the wave of the 
future. MINI MANSIONS 
But while computers and their combinations 
grow bigger and bigger, they also grow smaller 
and smaller. A complete computer the size of an 
Oreo cookie is now available, guaranteed for 
twentyfive years (and very expensive). But its 
actual heart, the Intel microprocessor, is only 
sixty bucks now , and just wait (see Microprocessors, 
P. */ ^). By 1980 there should be as many pro­
grammed and programmable objects in your house 
as you now have TVs, radios and typewriters; 
that's a conservative estimate. But just what these 
devices will all be doing— ah. there's the question 
that has many people talking to themselves. 
OTHER COMING THINGS? 
There are a lot of tall stories about what 
computers will do for the world. Among the most 
threatening. I think, are glowing reports of 
"scientific" politics (don't you believ*e it). We 
hear how computers will bring "science" to govern­
ment, helping, for example, to redraw the lines of 
election districts. (See Cybercrud. p. % .) 
Then you may also have heard that computers 
are going to be our new mentors and companions, 
tutoring us, chatting with us and perhapB lulling us 
to sleep— like Hal in 2001. Worried? Good. 
(See "The God-Builders," nip side.) (\*. 'Z^ 
A coUege student broke through the security of the 
Pacific Telephone computer system from a terminal and, 
according to Computerworld (6 June 73), stole over a 
million dollars worth of equipment by ordering it 
delivered to him! (Penthouse, December 73, claims he 
was in highschool and it was only nine hundred thousand 
but you get the idea.) 
After serving a few weeks in jail, he has formed 
his own computer-security consulting company. 
More power to him. 
The new breed has got to be watched. 
This is the urgency of this book. Remember 
that the man who writes the payroU program can 
write himself aome pretty amazing checks-- perhaps 
to be mailed out to Switzerland, next year. 
From here on it's computer politics, computer 
dirty tricks, computer wonderlands, computer 
everything. 
For anyone concerned to be where it's st, 
then, this book will provide a few suggestions. 
Now is the time you either know or you don't. 
Enough power talk. Knowledge Is power. 
Here you go. Dig in. 
GtTT?N(r THiMu-5 SLIGHT 
The greatest hurdle for the beginner (or 
"layman") is making an effort to grasp particulars 
of that which he hears about. 
A. WHAT IS ITS NAME? Every syatem or 
proposal or project has a name of some sort. Make 
an effort to learn it, or you're stuck trying to refer 
to "that computerish thing." 
(And don't be a anob about acronyms, those 
all-cap names and terms sprung from the foreheads 
of other words, like ILLIAC and PLATO and CAI. 
There's a need for them. Short words are too 
general lo use for nameB, and long phrases are 
too unwieldy.) 
B. IN WHAT PARTICULAR WAY DOES IT 
EMPLOY THE COMPUTER? For record-keeping? 
For looking stuff up quickly or fanclly? For 
searching out combinations? For making up combi­
nations and testing their properties? For enacting 
complex phenomena? As automatic typewriters? 
To play muaic, or just to store the written notes? 
It ia hoped thst you will become sensitive 
to these distinctions, and be able to understand and 
remember them after somebody explains them. 
Otherwise you're stuck just referring to 
"that computer business," and you're in with the 
rest of the sheep.

• This side of the book, Computer Lib proper (whose title is nevertheless 
the simplest way to refer to both halves) , is an attempt to explain simply and 
concisely why computers are marvelous and wonderful, and what aome main 
things are in the field , 
The second half of the book , Dream Machines, is specially about fantasy 
and imagination, and new techniques for it, That half is related to this half, 
but can be read first; I wanted to separate them as distinctly as possible. 
The remarks belo' 
of the book. 
FANDOM all refer to this first half, the Computer Lib half 
With this book I am no longer celling myself a computer 
professional. I'm a computer fan, and I'm out to make you 
one. (All computer professionals were fans once, but people 
get crabbier as they get older, and more professional.) 
A generation of computer fans and hobbyists is well on 
its way, but for the most part theBe are people who have 
had some sort of an In, This is meant to be an In for those 
who didn't get one earlier. 
Thfc computer fan Is someone who appreciates the 
options, fun, excitement, and fiendish fascination of computera, 
Not only Is the computer fun in itself, like electric trains; 
but it also extends to you a wide variety of possible personal 
uses. (In case you don't know it, the price of computers 
and of using them Is going down as foBt as every other 
price is going up. So in the next few decades we may be 
reduced to eating soybeans and carrots, but we'll certainly 
have computers.) 
Somehow the idea is abroad that computer activities 
are uncreative, aa compared, say, with rotating clay against 
your fingers until it becomes a pot. This is categorically 
false. Computers involve imagination and creation at the 
highest level. Computers are an Involvement you can really 
get into, regardless of your trip or your karma. They 
are toys, they are tools, they are glorious abstractions. 
So it you like mental creation, toy trains, or abstractions, 
computers are for you. If you are interested in democracy 
and its future, you'd better understand computers. And 
it you are concerned about power and the way it is being 
used, and aren't we all right now, the same thing goes. 
THE SOCIETY 
Which brings us to our next topic. 
There is no question of whether the computer will 
remake society; it has. You deal with computers perhaps 
many times a day-- or worse, computers deal with you , 
though you may not know it. Computers are going into 
everything, are intertwined with everything, and it's going 
to get more and more so. The reader should have a sense 
of the dance of options, the remarkably different wayB 
that computers may be used; by extension, he should come 
to see the extraordinary range of options which confront 
us as a society in our future use of them. Indeed, computers 
have with a swoop expanded the options of everything. 
But a variety of inconvenient systems already touch on 
our lives, nuisances we must deal with all the time; and 
1 fear that worse is to come. I would like to alert the reader , 
in no uncertain terms, that the time has come to be openly 
attentive and critical in observing and dealing with computer 
systems; and to transform criticism into action. If systems 
are bad, annoying and demeaning, these matters should 
be brought to the attention of the perpetrators. Politely 
at first. But just as the atmospheric pollution fostered by 
GM has become a matter for citizen concern and attack through 
legitimate channels of protest, so too should the procedural 
pollution of inconsiderate computer systems become a matter 
for the same kinds of concern. The reader should realize he 
can criticize and demand; 
THE PUBLIC DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE 
WHAT'S BEING DISHED OUT. There is already a backlash against computers, and 
the spirit of this anti-computer backlash is correct, but 
should be directed against very specific kinds of things. 
The public should stop being mad at "computers" in the 
abstract, and start being mad at the people who make in­
convenient systems. It is not "the computer," which has 
no intrinsic style or character, which is at fault; it is people 
who use "the computer" as an excuse to inconvenience you, 
who are at fault. The mechanisms of legitimate public 
protest-- sit-ins and so on— should perhaps soon be turned 
to complaint over bad and inhuman computer systems. 
The question is, will the crummier trends continue? 
Or can the public learn, in time, what good and beautiful 
things are possible, and translate this realization into an 
effective demand? I do not believe this is an obscure or 
specialized issue. Its shadow falls across the future of 
mankind . if any , like a giant sequoia. Either computer 
systems are going to go on inconveniencing our lives, or 
they are going to be turned around to make life better. 
This is one of the directions that consumerism should turn. 
I have an axe to grind: 1 want to see computers useful 
to individuals, and the sooner the better, without necessary 
complication or human servility being required. Anyone 
who agrees with these principles is on my side, and anyone 
who does not, is not. 
THIS BOOK IS FOR PERSONAL FREEDOM, 
AND AGAINST RESTRICTION AND COERCION. 
That's really all it's about. Many people, for reasons of 
their own, enjoy and believe in restricting and coercing 
people; the reader may decide whether he is for or against 
this principle. 
A chant you can take to the streets: 
COMPUTER POWER TO THE PEOPLE! 
DOWN WITH CYBERCRUD! 
THE FUTURE. IF ANY 
Simply as a matter of citizenship, it is essential to 
understand the impact and uses of computers in the world 
of the future, if any; and to have a sense of the issues about 
computers that confront us as a people-- especially privacy 
and data banks , but also strange new additions to our 
economic system ("the checkless society"). our political 
system (half-baked vote-at-home proposals), and so on. 
1 regret that there is not room to cover these here. 
Various companies are seeking wide public support for 
the sorts of things they are trying to bring about. Legislation 
will be proposed on which the views of the public should 
have a bearing. It is important that these be understood 
sensibly by some part of the electorate before they arc made 
too permanent, rather than made matters of dumb assent. 
Finally , and most solemnly . computers are helping 
us understand the unprecedented danger of our future 
(see "The Club of Rome," p.£8). The human race may 
have only a short time left on earth, even if there is no war. 
These studies must be seen and understood by as many 
intelligent men of good will as possible. 
Welcome to the computer world, the damndest and 
craziest thing that has ever happened. But we. the computer 
people, are not crazy. It is you others who are crazy to 
let us have all this fun and power to ourselves.

or one of them: cold, immaculate, sterile, "scientific," oppressive. 
Some people flee this image. Others, drawn toward it. have 
joined the cold-sterile-oppressive cult, and propagate it like a faith. 
Many are still about this mischief, making people do things rigidly 
and saying it is the computer's fault. 
Still others see computer' for what they really sre: versatile 
gizmos which may be turned to any purpose, in any style. And so 
a wealth of new styles and human purposes are being proposed and 
tried, each proponent propounding his own dream in his own very 
personal way. 
This book presents a panoply of things and dreams. Perhaps 
some will appeal to the reader. .. 
THE COMPUTER PRIESTHOOD 
Any nitwit can understand computers, and msny do. 
Unfortunstely, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, 
computers have been made a mystery to most of the world. 
And this situation does not seem to be improving. You 
hesr more and more about computers, but to most people 
it's just one big blur. The people who know about computers 
often seem unwilling to explain things or answer your ques­
tions. Stereotyped notions develop about computers operating 
in fixed ways--and so confusion increases. The chasm 
between laymen and computer people widens fast and danger­
ously . 
This book is a measure of desperation, so serious 
and abysmal is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. 
Anything with buttons or lights can be palmed off on the 
layman as a computer. There are so many different things, 
and their differences are so important; yet to the lay public 
they are lumped together as "computer stuff," indistinct 
and beyond understanding or criticism . It's as if people 
couldn't tell apart camera from exposure meter or tripod, 
or car from truck or tollbooth. This book is therefore devoted 
to the premise that 
EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND COMPUTERS. 
It is intended to fill a crying need. Lots of everyday people 
have asked me where they can learn about computers, and 
I have had to say nowhere. Most of what is written about 
computers for the layman is either unreadable or silly. 
(Some exceptions are listed nearby; you can go to them 
instead of this if you want.) But virtually nowhere is the 
big picture simply enough explained. Nowhere can one 
get a simple, soup-to-nuts overview of what computers 
are really about, without technical or mathematical mumbo-
jumbo, complicated examples, or talking down. This book 
is an attempt. 
(And nowhere hsve I seen a simple book explaining 
to the layman the fabulous wonderland of computer graphics 
which awaits us all, a matter which means a great deal 
to me personally, as well as a lot to all of us in general. 
That's discussed on the flip side.) 
Computers are simply a necessary and enjoyable 
part of life, like food and books. Computers are not everything, 
they are just an aspect of everything, and not to know this 
is computer illiteracy, a silly and dangerous ignorance. 
Computers are as easy to understand as cameras. 
I have tried to make this book like a photography magazine— 
breezy, forceful and as vivid as possible. This book will 
explain how to tell apples from oranges and which way 
ia up. If you want to make cider , or help get things right 
side up. you will have to go on from here. 
I am not a skillful programmer, hands-on person 
or eminent professional; 1 am just a computer fan, computer 
fanatic if you will. But if Dr. David Reuben can write about 
Bex I can certainly write about computers. I have written 
this like a letter lo a nephew , chatty and personal. This 
is perhaps less boring for the reader, and certainly less 
boring for the writer, who is doing this in a hurry. Like 
a photography magazine, it throws at you some rudiments 
in s merry setting. Other things are thrown in so you'll 
get the sound of them , even if the details are elusive. 
(We lesrn most everyday things by beginning with vague 
impressions, but somehow encouraging these is not usually 
felt to be respectable.) What I have chosen for inclusion 
here has been arbitrary, based on what might amuse and 
give quick insight. Any bright highschool kid . or anyone 
else who can stumble through the details of a photography 
magazine, should be able lo understand thia book. or get 
the main ideas. This will not make you a programmer or 
• computer person, though it may help you talk thst talk, 
and perhaps make you feel more comfortable (or at least 
able to cope) when new machines encroach on your life. 
If you can get a chance to learn programming- - Bee the 
suggestions on p. -- it's an awfully good experience for 
anybody above fourth grade. But the main idea of this 
book ia to help you tell apples from oranges. and which 
way is up. 1 hope you do go on from here. and have made 
a few suggestions. 
I am "publishing" this book myself, in this first 
draft form, to test its viability, to see how mad the computer 
people get. and to see if there is as much hunger to understand 
computers, among all you Folks Out There, as 1 Ihink. 
I will be interested to receive corrections and suggestions 
for subsequent editions. if any . (The computer field is 
its own exploding universe. so I'll worry about up-to-deteness 
at that time -) Knowledge is power and so it tends to be hoarded. 
Experts in any field rarely want people to understand what 
they do,and generally enjoy putting people down. 
Thus if we say that the use of computers is dominated 
by a priesthood, people who spatter you with unintelligable 
answers and seem unwilling to give you straight ones, 
it is not that they are different in this respect from any 
other profession. Doctors, lawyers and construction engineers 
are the same way. 
But computers are very special, and we have to deal 
with them everywhere, and this effectively gives the computer 
priesthood a stranglehold on the operation of all large organiza­
tions, of government bureaux, and anything else that they 
run. Members of Congress are now complaining about 
control of information by the computer people, that they 
cannot get the information even though it's on computers. 
Next to this it seems a small matter that in ordinary companies 
"untrained" personnel can't get straight questions answered 
by computer people; but it's the same phenomenon. 
It is imperative for many reasons that the appalling 
gap between public and computer insider be closed. As 
the saying goes, war is too important to be left to the generals. 
Guardianship of the computer can no longer be left to a 
priesthood. I see this as just one example of the creeping 
evil of Professionalism ,* the control of aspects of society 
by cliques of insiders . There may be some chance. though, 
that Professionalism can be turned around. Doctors, for 
example, are being told that they no longer own people's 
bodies . And this book may suggest to some computer 
professionals that their position should not be as sacrosanct 
as they have thought, cither. 
This in not to say that computer people are trying 
to louse everybody up on purpose. Like anyone trying 
to do a complex job as he sees fit, they don't want to be 
bothered with idle questions and complaints. Indeed, probab­
ly any group of insiders would have hoarded computers 
just as much. If the computer had evolved from the telegraph 
(which it just might have), perhaps the librarians would 
have hoarded it conceptually as much as the math and en­
gineering people have. But things have gone too far. 
People have legitimate complaints about the way computers 
are used, and legitimate ideas for ways they should be 
used, which should no longer be shunted aside. 
In no way do I mean to condemn computer people 
in general. (Only the ones who don't want you to know 
what's going on.) The field is full of fine. imaginative 
people. Indeed, the number of creative and brilliant people 
known within the field for their clever and creative contri­
butions is considerable. They deserve to be known as widely 
as , say . good photographers or writers . 
"Computers are catching hell from growing multitudes 
who see them uniformly as the tools of the 
regulation and suffocation of all things warm , 
moist, and human. The charges, of course, 
are not totally unfounded, but in their most 
sweeping form they are ineffective and therefore 
actually an acquiescence to the dehumanization 
which they decry. We clearly need a much more 
discerning evaluation in order to clarify the 
ethica of various roles of machines in human 
affairs."

• This Is a side point. I see Professionalism as a spreading 
disease of the present-day world, * sort of poly-oligarchy 
by which various groups (subway conductors, social workers, 
bricklayers) csn bring things to a halt if their particular 
new increased demands are not met. (Meanwhile, the irrele­
vance of each profession increases, in proportion to its 
increasing rigidity.) Such lucky groups demand more 
in each go-round- - but meantime, the number who are 
permanently unemployed grows and grows.
