Any nitwit can understand computers, and many do. 
Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, 
computers have been made a mystery to most of the w orld.
And this situation does not seem to be Improving. You 
hear more and more about computers, but to most people 
it's just one big b lu r.  The people who know sbout computers 
often seem unwilling to explain things or answer your ques­
tions . Stereotyped notions develop about computers operating 
In fixed w ays-- and so confusion increases. The chasm 
between lsymen and computer people widens fast and danger­
ously .
This book Is a measure of desperation, so serious 
and abysms! Is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. 
Anything with buttons or lights can be palmed off on the 
layman as a computer. There are so many different things, 
and their differences are so important; yet to the lay public 
they are lumped together as "computer stuff." indistinct 
and beyond understanding or criticism. It’s as If people 
couldn't tell apart camera from exposure meter or tripod, 
or car from truck or tollbooth. This book is therefore devoted 
to the premise that
EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND COMPUTERS .
It is intended to fill a crying need. Lots of everyday people 
have aeked me where they can learn about computers, and 
1  have had to say nowhere. Most of what is written about 
computers for the layman is either unreadable or silly.
(Some exceptions are listed nearby: you can go to them 
Instead of this if you want.) But virtually nowhere is the 
big picture simply enough explained. Nowhere can one 
get a simple, soup-to-nut6 overview of what computers 
are really about, without technical or mathematical mumbo- 
jumbo, complicated examples, or talking down. This book 
is an attempt.
(And nowhere have I seen a simple book explaining 
to the layman the fabulous wonderlsnd of computer graphics 
which awaits us all. a matter which means a great deal 
to me personally . as well as a lot to all of us in general.
That's discussed on the flip side.)
Computers are simply a necessary and enjoyable 
part of life, like food and books. Computers are not everything, 
they are just an aspect of everything, and not to know this 
is computer Illiteracy, a silly and dangerous ignorance.
Computers are as easy to understand as cameras.
I have tried to make this book like a photography magazine-- 
breery, forceful and as vivid ss possible. This book will 
explain how to tell apples from oranges and which way 
la u p . If you want to make cider, or help get things right 
aide u p , you will have to go on from h ere.
I am not a skillful programmer, hands-on person 
or eminent professional; I am just a computer fan. computer 
fanatic if you will. But if Dr. David Reuben can write about 
sex I can certainly write about computers. I have written 
this like a letter to a nephew , chatty and personal.  This 
is perhaps less boring for the resder. and certainly less 
boring for the w riter. who is doing this in a h u rry . Like 
a photography magazine, it throws at you some rudiments 
In a merry setting. Other things are thrown in so you'll 
get the sound of them, even if the details are elusive.
(W e learn most everyday things by beginning with vague 
impressions, but somehow encouraging these is not usually 
felt to be respectable.) What I have chosen for inclusion 
here has been arb itrary . based on what might amuse and 
give quick Insight.  Any bright highschool kid, or anyone 
else who can stumble through the details of s photography 
magazine, should be able to understand this book, or get 
the main ideas. This will not make you a programmer or 
a computer person, though it may help you talk that talk .  
and perhaps make you feel more comfortable (or at least 
able to cope) when new machines encroach on your life.
If you can get a chance to learn programming-- see the 
suggestions on p . -- it's an awfully good experience for 
anybody above fourth grade.  But the main idea of this 
book is to help you tell apples from oranges. and which 
wsy is up. I hope you do go on from here, and have made 
a few suggestions.
1  am "publiahing" this book myself. In this first 
draft form, to test its viability, to see how mad the computer 
people g et. and to see If there is as much hunger to understand 
computers, among all you Polks Out T here, as I think.
I will be interested to receive corrections and suggestions 
for subsequent editions. if any. (The computer field is 
Its own exploding universe, so I'll worry about up-to-dateness 
at that time.)0* T H U  * * * ;
Man has created the myth of "the computer" in his own image, 
or one of them: cold, immaculate, sterile, "scientific." oppressive.
Some people flee this image. Others, drawn toward it, have 
joined the cold-sterile-oppressive cult, and propagate it like a faith. 
Many are still sbout this mischief, making people do things rigidly 
and saying it is the computer's fault.
Still others see computer* for what they really are: versatile 
gizmos which may be turned to any purpose, in any style. And so 
a wealth of new stylea and human purposes are being proposed and 
tried, each proponent propounding his own dream in his own very 
personal way.
This book presents s panoply of things and dreams. Perhaps 
some will appeal to the re a d e r...
THE COMPUTER PRIESTHOOD
Knowledge is power and so it tends to be hoarded. 
Experts in any field rarely want people to understand what 
they do .and generally enjoy putting people down.
Thus if we say that the use of computers Is dominated 
by a priesthood. people who spatter you with unlntelligable 
answ ers and seem unwilling to give you straight ones.  
it is not that they are different in this respect from any 
other profession. Doctors, lawyers and construction engineers 
are the same way.
But computers are very special. and we have to deal 
with them everywhere, and this effectively gives the computer 
priesthood a stranglehold on the operation of all large organiza­
tions. of government bureaux, and anything else that they 
ru n . Members of Congress are now complaining about 
control of information by the computer people. that they 
cannot get the information even though it's on computers.
Next to this it seems a small matter that in ordinary companies 
"untrained" personnel can't gel straight questions answered 
by computer people; but it's the same phenomenon.
It is imperative for many reasons that the appalling 
gap between public and computer insider be closed. As 
the saying goes. war is too important to be left to the generals. 
Guardianship of the computer can no longer be left to a 
priesthood.  1  see this as just one example of the creeping 
evil of Professionalism .* the control of aspects of society 
by cliques of insiders. There may be some chance, though, 
that Professionalism can be turned around. Doctors, for 
example, are being told that they no longer own people's 
bodies. "* And this book may suggest to some computer 
professionals that their position should not be as sacrosanct 
as they have thought, cither.
This in not to say that computer people are trying 
to louse everybody up on purpose. Like anyone trying 
to do a complex job as he sees fit. they don't want to be 
bothered with idle questions and complaints. Indeed, probab­
ly any group of insiders would have hoarded computers 
just as much. If the computer had evolved from the telegraph 
(which it just might have). perhaps the librarians would 
have hoarded it conceptually as much as the math and en­
gineering people have. But things have gone too far.
People have legitimate complaints about the way computers 
are u sed . and legitimate ideas for ways they should be 
used, which should no longer be shunted aside.
In no way do I mean to condemn computer people 
in general. (Only the ones who don't want you to know 
what's going on.) The field is full of fine, imaginative 
people. Indeed, the number of creative and brilliant people 
known within the field for their clever and creative contri­
butions is considerable. They deserve to be known as widely 
a s . say, good photographers or w rite rs.
"Computers are catching h^ll from growing multitudes 
who see them uniformly as the tools of the 
regulation and suffocation of all things warm .  
moist, and human. The charges, of course, ' 
are not totally unfounded, but in their most 
sweeping form they are ineffective and therefore 
actually an acquiescence to the dehumanization 
which they d ecry . We clearly need a much more 
discerning evaluation in order to clarify the 
ethics of various roles of machines in human 
affairs."

* This is a side point. I see Professionalism aa a spreading 
disease of the present-day world, a sort of poly-oligarchy 
by which various groups (subway conductors, social workers, 
bricklayers) can bring things to a halt if their particular 
new increased demands are not met. (Meanwhile, the Irrele­
vance of each profession increases, in proportion to its 
increasing rigidity.) Such lucky groups demand more 
In each go-round-- but meantime, the number who are 
permanently unemployed grows and grows.

*moe£ IT'S AT
Computers are where It's at.
Recently a bank employee was accused of 
embezzling a million and a hall dollars by clever 
computer programming. Hie programs shifted 
funds from hundreds of people's accounts to his 
own. but apparently kept things looking Innocent 
by clever programming tricks. According to the 
papers, the program kept up appearances by 
redeposltlng lhe stolen amount in each account just 
as interest payments were about to be calculated, 
then withdrawing It again just after. ("Chief 
Teller la Accused of Theft of Si. 5  Million at a Bank 
Here." New York Times, 23 March 73, p. 1.)
The alleged embezzlement was discovered, not by 
bank audit, but by records found on the premises 
of a raided bookmaker.
In a recent scandal that has rocked the 
insurance world, an Insurance company appears 
to have generated thousands of fictitious customers 
and accounts by computer, then bilked other 
inaurance companies-- those who re-insured the 
original fictitious policies-- by fictitious claims 
on the fictitious misfortunes of the fictitious 
policy-holders.
In April of 1673, according to the Chicsgo 
radio, a burglary ring had a "computerized" list 
of a thousand prospective victims.
There have been Instances where dishonest 
university students, nevertheless sble programmers, 
were able to change their course grades. stored 
on a central university computer.
It is not unheard of for ace programmers to 
create grand incomprehensible systems that run 
whole companies, systems they can personally play 
like a piano, and then blackmail their Arms.
A friend of a friend of the author Is an ace 
programmer at the Pentagon ■ supposedly a private 
supervising colonels. On days he Is mad at his 
boss, he says, the army cannot find out Ha strength 
within 300,000 men. Or three million if he so 
chooses.
This awkward state of affairs, obviously 
spanning both the American continent and most 
realms of endeavor, has come about for various 
reasons.
First, the climate of uncomprehenalon leads 
men in management to treat computer matters as 
"mere technicalities"—  a myth as sinister as the 
public notion that computers are "scientific"-* 
and abandon the kind of scrutiny they sensibly 
apply to any other company activities.
Second ■ most of today's computer systems are 
Inherently leaky and Insecure— and likely lo stay 
that way awhile. Getting things to work on them 
Involves giving people extraordinary and Invisible 
powers. (Eventually this will change, but watch 
out for the meantime.)The obvious consequence Is simply for the 
computer people to be allowed to take over 
altogether. It may Indeed be that computer people 
-- the more well-informed and visionary ones, 
anyway— can see the farthest, and appreciate 
most deeply the better ways things can go, and 
the steps that have to be taken to get there. (And 
Boards of Managers can at least be partially assured 
that hanky-panky at the lower levels will be 
prevented, If men In charge know where the bodies 
are burled. )
That seems to be how It's going. Examples:
The president of Dartmouth College, John 
Kemeny, is a respected computerman and a devel­
oper of one of the important computing languages,  
BASIC (see p. \(, ).
The new president of the Russell Sage Foun­
dation, Hugh Cline, used to teach computing at 
Columbia.
It's probably the same in Industry. In other 
words, more and more, for better and for w orse,  
things are being run by people who know how to 
use computers, and this trend is probsbly irre­
versible.
In some ways, of course, this la s sinister 
portent. In private industry It's not so bad, 
since the danger is more of embezzlement and 
botch-up than of public menace. But then there's 
the problem of the government. The men who 
manage the Information tools sre more and more 
In charge of government, loo. And If we can have 
a Watergate without computers, just wait. (See 
"Burning Issues," p. 5g)
The way to defend ourselves sgalnst computer 
people la to become computer people ourselves.
Which of course Is the point. W e must all become 
computer people, at least to the extent that we have 
already become Automobile People and Camera 
People— that is, Informed enough to tell when one 
goes by or when someone points one at you.
M ANY M ANSIONS
The future is going to be full of computers, 
for good or ill. Many computer systems are being 
prepsred by a variety of lunatics, idealists and 
dreamers, as well as profit-hungry companies and 
unimaginative clods, all for the benefit of msnklnd. 
Which ones will work and which ones we will like is 
another matter. The grand and dreamy ones bid fair 
to reorganize drastically the lives of mankind.
For Instance, Doug Engelbart at Stanford 
Research Institute has a beautiful system, called NI£, 
that will allow us to use computers aa a generalized 
postoffice and publication system. From your com­
puter terminal you just sign onto Engelbart's System, 
and you're at once In touch with lots of writings by 
other subscribers. which you may call to your 
screen and write replies to.
(These grander and dreamier applications are 
discussed on the other side of this book.)
But the plain computer visions are grand 
enough.But while computers and their combinations 
grow bigger and bigger, they also grow smaller 
and smaller. A complete computer the size of an 
OreoTwolde Is now available, guaranteed for 
twentyflve years (and very expensive). But its 
actual heart, the Intel microprocessor. Is only 
sixty bucks now, and just wait (see Microprocessors, 
p . * / ^ ). By 19B0 there should be as many pro­
grammed and programmable objects In your house 
as you now have TVs, radios and typewriters; 
that's s conservative estimate. But just what these 
devices will all be doing—  ah ■ there's the question 
that has many people talking to themselvea.
OTHER COM ING THINGS?
There are a lot of tall stories about what 
computers will do for the world. Among lhe most 
threatening, I think, are glowing reporta of 
"scientific" politics (don't you believe it) . W e 
hear how computers will bring "science” to govern­
ment, helping, for example, to redraw the lines of 
election districts. (See Cybercrud, p . $ .)
Then you may also have heard that computers 
are going to be our new mentors and companions, 
tutoring u s, chatting with us and perhaps lulling us 
to sleep— like Hal in 2001. Worried? Good.
(See "The God-Builders," nip side.) (t. '^)
6) o t z t a h  i m t n p i r
A college student broke through the security of the 
Pacific Telephone computer system from a terminal and,  
according to Computerworld (6 June 73), stole over s 
million dollars worth of equipment by ordering it 
delivered to him! (Penthouse, December 73, claims he 
was in hlghschool and it was only nine hundred thousand, 
but you gel the idea.)
After serving a few weeks In jail, he has formed 
his own computer-securlty consulting compsny.
More power to him.
The new breed has got to be watched.
This is the urgency of this book. Remember 
that the man who writes lhe payroll program can 
write himself some pretty amazing checks-- perhaps 
to be mailed out to Switzerland, next year.
From here on it's computer politics, computer 
dirty tricks, computer wonderlands, computer 
everything.
For anyone concerned to be where it's a t,  
then, this book will provide a few suggestions.
Now is the Ume you either know or you don't.
Enough power talk. Knowledge Is power. 
Here you go. Dig in.
The great world of time-sharing, for Instance.  
("Time-sharing" means thst the computer's time is 
shared by a variety of users simultaneously. See 
p . i? . ) If you have an account on a time-sharing 
computer, you can sign on from your terminal 
(see p. I'f) over any telephone, no matter where 
you are, and at once do anylhlng that particular 
computer allows— calling up programs in a variety 
of computer languages, dipping into data on a 
variety of subjects as easily as one now consults 
a chart.
For instance, at Dartmouth College-- where 
time-sharing is perhaps farthest advanced as a 
way of life— the user (any Dartmouth student, for 
instance) can just sit down at a terminal and write 
a simple program (In Dartmouth's BASIC language, 
for Instance) to analyze cenaus data. Since Dart­
mouth has a complete file on its time-shsrlng system 
of the detailed sample from the 1070 census, the 
program can buzz through that and report almost 
immediately the numbers of divorced Aleuts or 
boy millionaires in the sample, or (more signifi­
cantly) the relative Incomes of different ethnic 
groups when categorized according to the quea- 
tioner's interests.
But simple time-sharing la only the beginning. 
Networks of computers are now coming into being. 
Most significant of these is the ARPANET (financed 
by AAPA, the Defense Department's Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, it is nonetheless non- 
mtlitary In character). Dozens of large time-shsring 
computers around the country are being tied into the 
Arpanet. and a user of any of these can reach dir­
ectly into the olher computers of the netw ork- 
using their programs, data or other facilities.  
Arpanet enthusiasts see this aa the wave of the 
future.G E T T I N G - W S S T N I f i H t
The greatest hurdle for the beginner (or 
"layman") is making an effort to grasp particulars 
of that which he hears about.
A. W HAT IS ITS NAME? Every system or 
proposal or project has a name of some sort. Make 
an effort to learn it, or you're stuck trying to refer 
to "that computerish thing."
(And don't be a snob about acronyms, those 
all-cap names snd terms sprung from the foreheads 
of other words, like ILLIAC and PLATO and CAI. 
There's a need for them. Short words are too 
general to use for names, and long phrases are 
too unwieldy.)
B. IN  W HAT PARTICULAR W AY  DOBS IT 
EMPLOY THE COMPUTER? For record-keeping?
For looking stuff up quickly or fancily? For 
sesrchlng out combinations? For making up combi­
nations and testing their properties? For enacting 
complex phenomena? As automatic typewriters?
To play music, or just to store the written notes?
It is hoped thst you will become sensitive 
to these distinctions, and be able to understand and 
remember them after somebody explains them.
Otherwise you're stuck just referring to 
"that computer business," and you're In with the 
rest of the sheep.

People ask me often where they can learn
about "science." As In all fields, maga­
zines are usually the b est sources of 
general orientation.
Science Digest Is kind of helpful for a start.
although unfortunately they print summaries 
of every fool study that generalizes to the 
hearts of all humanity from two dozen Iowa 
State freshm en.
Scientific American is the favorite. Some stuff 
Is hard to read but some .isn't; the pic­
tures and diagrams are te rrific .
Science t  Technology magazine seems to me
one of the b etter ones-- breezy, informa­
tiv e, not trivial.
Science magazine is read by most actual scien­
tists, and if you have a lively curiosity 
and can guess at the m eanings’of w ords, 
will tell you an incredible amount. (This 
is a main source for the science articles 
in the New York T im es, which in t u r n ...)  
T heir articles on politics of science, and 
the future, are very interesting, important, 
and dep ressin g . You have to Join Am. Assn.

Daniel S. G reenberg's Science and Government 
Report (so rry — $35 a year) is what really 
tells it. G reenberg is the man who knows, 
both what is shaping up in science and 
the insane governmental confusions and 
floundering responses and grandstanding 
and po rk -b arrel in itia tiv e s...
G reenberg is, incidentally, one of 
the finest w riters of o ur time and a great 
h um orist.

This diagram shows the amazing and unique way prices 
drop in the computer field. The prices shown are for the first 
minicomputer, the PDP-5 (and its hugely popular offspring, the 
PDP-8); but the principle has held throughout the field, and the 
downward trend will probably accelerate due to the new big 
Integrated circuits.
Another example: an IBM 7090, a very decent million-dollar 
computer in 1960, was put up for sale at a modish Parke-Bernet 
"used computer auction" in 1970. If I remember aright, they 
could not get a $1000 b id , because today's machines are so much 
sm aller, faster and more dependable.

ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery.
This is the main computer professional 
society; the title only has meaning histor­
ically , as many members are concerned not 
with machinery itself, but with software, 
languages, theories and so on.
If you have any plans to stick with 
the subject, membership in the Association 
for Computing Machinery is highly recom­
m ended. ACM calls itself "The Society of 
the Computing Community." T hus it properly 
embraces both professionals and fans.
Dues for official students are  $0 a y ear, 
$35 for o thers, which includes a subscription 
to Communications of the ACM, the official 
mag. Their address for memberships and 
magazines is ACM, P.O. Box 12105,
Church St. Station, New York, NY 10249. 
(The actual ACM HQ is at 1133 Ave. of the 
Am ericas, New York. N.Y. 10036.)
They have stacked the deck so that 
if you want to subscribe to any ACM maga­
zines you'd better join anyway. Here are 
the year prices:
Member Non-Member 
Communications of the ACM free $35
Computing Surveys $7 $25
Computing Reviews $12.50 $35
Journal of the ACM $7 $30
The one drawback lo joining the ACM 
is all the doggoned mailing lists it gets you 
on. It's unclear w hether there's anything 
you can do to prevent this, but there oughta 
be.
SIGs and SICs. For ACM members 
with special interests (and we all have them ), 
the ACM contains subdivisions-- clubs within 
the club, of people who keep in touch to 
share their interests. These are called SICs 
(Special Interest Committees) and SIGs 
(Special Interest G roups). T here are such 
clubs-- SICs and SIGs— in numerous area s, 
including Programming Languages, Computer 
Usage in Education, etc. Encouraging these 
subinterests lo stay within ACM saves a lot 
of trouble for everybody and keeps ACM the 
central society.
AFIPS.
AFIPS is the UN of computing. They 
sponsored the Joints , and now sponsor the 
NCC. Just as individuals can't join the UN, 
they can't join AFIPS, which stands for 
American Federation of Information Proces­
sing Societies. Depending on your special 
in terests, though, you can join a member 
society.
The constituent societies of AFIPS are, 
as of June 1973: (If any turn you o n , write 
AFIPS for addresses: AFIPS, 210 Summit Ave. 
Montvale NJ 07645.) 
ft* ACM: the Association for Computing M achinery.  
IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers. This is the professional society 
of electronics guys.
Simulation Councils. This is the professional 
society for those interested in Simulation 
(see p . 5 3 ).
Association for Computational L inguistics. (Where 
language and computer types g ath e r.) 
American Association of Aeronautics and 
A stronautics.
American Statistical A ssociation.
Instrum ent Society of America.
Society for Information Display. (See flip sid e.) 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
American Society for Information Science. (This 
group is mainly for electronified librarians 
and information retrieval types-- see 
flip sid e .)
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 
Special Libraries Association.
Association for Educational Data Systems.
IFIP. This is the international computer society. 
Like AFIPS, its members are societies, so 
joining ACM makes you an IFIP participant.
IFIP holds conferences around the 
w orld. Fun. Expense.
t i n o * * .CONFERENCES.
Conferences in any field are exciting, at least 
till you reach a certain degree of boredom with the 
field. Computer conferences have their own heady 
atm osphere, compounded of a sense of elitism, of 
being in the w itches' cauldron, and the su re sense 
of the impact everything you see will have as it all 
grows and grow s. Plus you get to look at gadgets.
Usually to go for one day doesn't cost m uch,  
and at the bigger ones you get lots of free literature, 
have salesmen explain their things to you, see 
m ovies, hear fascinaling (sometimes) speakers.
THE JOINTS! The principal computer confer­
ences have always been the Spring Joint 
Computer Conference, held in an 
Eastern city in May, and the Fall Joint 
Computer Conference, held in a Western 
city in November (the infamous Spring 
Joint and Fall Jo in t, or SJCC and F JC C ).  
In 1973, because of poor business the 
previous y e a r, the two were collapsed 
into one National Computer Conference 
(NCC) in June (Universal Joint?) The 
Joints have always been sponsored by 
AFIPS (see below). The National 
Computer Conference will henceforth 
be annual, at least for a while.
The cost of attending is high-- 
w hile it's just a couple of dollars lo 
look at the exhibits, this rises to 
perhaps fifteen dollars to go to the day's 
technical sessions or fifty for the week 
(not counting lodging and e a ts)-- but 
it's very much worth it. The lower age 
limit for attendees is something like 
tw elve, unfortunately for those 
with interested children.
Other important conferences: the annual ACM 
conference in the summer; BEMA 
(Business Equipment Mfrs. A ssn.) 
in the fall and sp rin g  (no theory, but 
lots of gadgets); and other conferencs 
on special su b jec ts. held all the time 
all over. Lists of conferences and 
th eir whereabouts are in most of the 
magazines; Communications of the ACM 
and Computer Design have the biggest 
lists.CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS.
As you may k n o w , conferences largely con­
sist of separate "sessions" in which different people 
talk on specific topics, usually reading out loud from 
th eir notes and show ing slides.
Conference proceedings are books which 
result from conferences. Supposedly they contain 
what each guy said; in practice people say one thing 
and publish another, more formal than the actual 
presentation.
This leads to a curious phenomenon at the 
main computer conferences (SJCC,FJCC, ACM and 
now NCC) . When you re g iste r they give you a book 
(you’re actually paying perhaps $15 for i t ) , contain­
ing all the papers that are about lo be given, nicely 
tricked out by their authors. If you ru sh  to a corner 
and look at the book it may change your notion of 
which sessions to go to.
Anyway , the re sulting volumes of conference 
proceedings are a tre a su re  trove of interesting papers 
on an immense variety of computerish and not-so- 
com puterish subjects. Great for brow sing.
Expensive but w onderful. (Horrible when you're 
m oving, though, as they are big and h ea v y .)
JOINT PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings for the 
Spring Joint and Fall Joint, from the 
fifties to 1972. are available from AFIPS 
P ress, as are  proceedings of the 1973 
NCC. (AFIPS P ress, 210 Summit Avenue, 
Montvale NJ 07645.) They cost $20-26 
each after the conference is over; less 
in microfilm. (At the Joint Conferences, 
AFIPS P ress often gives discounts, at 
their booth, on back Joint proceedings.)
t > > l f  you want to spend money to 
learn about the field. Proceedings of 
the Joint Conferences a re  a fine buy.
Back ACM Proceedings. From the ACM.
Other Proceedings ■ Often sold at counters at 
conferences. Or available from various 
pu b lish ers. Join the ACM and you’ll 
find out soon enough.
TRY TO GET TO THE NATIONAL JOINT. Ju st as 
every Muslim should go to Mecca, every 
computer fan should go to a National Joint 
(National Computer Conference, or N CC).  
The next two are (check the magazines):
May 1974, Chicago
May 1975,— Son Pranoitao-. P j M A
NO QUALIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. Think of it 
as a circus for sm art alecks, o r, if you 
p re fer, a Deep Educational Experience.
V o H u r  H ^ r p u f *  I f  y o u  T i m e  C P M P u r e n  c e u n j e i ?
There is a lot of talk about "best" ways of teaching about com puters, but in most places 
the actual alternatives open to those who want to learn are  fairly dism al.
U niversities. Universities and colleges tend to teach computing with a mathematical 
emphasis at the start. Indeed, most seem to req u ire that to get into the introductory computer 
co u rse, you must have had higher math (at least ca lcu lu s, sometimes matrix algebra as w e ll). 
This is preposterous, like requiring an engineering degree to drive a car. (Gradeschool kids 
can learn lo program with no p rereq u isites.)
t£»lt seems lo be to cut down enrollment, since th ey 're not set up to deal with all those 
people who want to learn aboul computers. (And why not?) Also it's a status thing; as if 
this restriclion somehow should keep enrollment to students with "logical m inds," w halever 
those a re, or "mathematical sophistication," as if that w ere relevant.
"Computer schools," community and commercial colleges, on the other hand, tend to 
prepare sludents only for the most humdrum business applications- - keypunching (which is 
rapidly becoming obsolete), and programming in the COBOL language on IBM b usiness system s. 
T his gets you no closer to the more exciting applications of com puters than you w ere originally.
Some experim ental trends are more encouraging. Some colleges, for instance, offer 
"computer appreciation courses," with a w ider introduction to w hat's available and more varied 
program m ing intended lo serve as an introduction to this w ider horizon.
Highschool courses seem to be cutting through the junk and offering students access to 
minicomputers with quickie languages, usually BASIC. Both Digital Equipment Corp. and 
Hewlett-Packard seem to be making inroads here.
Kiddie se tu p s, rumored to exist in Boston and San Francisco, are  geared lo letting 
grade-school children see and play with com puters. Also one company (General T u rtle , see 
p . '5 7 ) is selling computer toys Intended to encourage actual program m ing by children.

O T T O
A num ber of people have gotten mad at me 
for coining the term " c y b e rc ru d ,"  which 1  define 
as "putting things o v e r on people usin g  co m p u te rs.”  
But a s long as it goes on w e'll need the w o rd . At 
every co rn e r of o u r so c iety , people are issu in g  
pronouncements and m aking other people do things 
and saying it’s  b ecau se of th e com puter.  T h e 
function of cy b ercru d  is thus lo confuse.  intimi­
date o r p re ssu re . We have all got to get w ise to 
this if it is going to be curtailed.
C y bercrud lak es num erous form s. All of 
them , how ever, sh a re  the pad n a of "science" that 
com puters have fo r the laym an.
la) COMPUTER AS MAGIC WORD
T h e  most delicate, and seemingly innocent, 
technique Is the p rac d ce  or naming th in g s SO as 
spuriously to sugg est that they involve com puters. 
Thus th e re  Is a m anufacturer of pot-pipes with 
"Data" In Its nam e.  end apparently a p o rnography 
house with a "C y b er-".
lb ) COMPUTER AS MAGIC INGREDIENT
T h e above seam s silly , but It is no less silly 
than talking about "com puter predictions" and 
"computer studies" of th in g s .  T h e m ere fact that 
a computer is Involved in  som ething h as no b e arin g  
on its ch aracter or v alid ity . The way things are
done with com puters affects th eir c h arac ter and 
validity. Juat like the w ay things are done without 
com puters. (Indeed, merely usin g  a computer 
often has no bearing on the w ay things a re  d o n e .)
T his same technique is easily magnified to 
suggest, not merely that something involves 
com puters, but is w holly done by co m puters. The 
word "computerize” perform s this fatal function. 
When used specifically ,  as in  com puterize the 
billing operatio n , it can be fairly clear: but make 
it vague, as in  com puterize lh e office,  and it can 
mean anything,
"Fully com puterize" is w orse. T hus we hear 
about a "fully com puterized" p rin t shop, w hich 
tu rn s out to be one w hose com puters do th e type­
setting: but they could also ru n  the p re6 6 e s. pay 
the bills and work th e coffee machine- For p ra c ­
tical p u rp o ses, th e re  is no su c h  thing as "fully" 
com puterized- T h e re  is alw ays one more thing 
com puters could do.
BY THE AID OF THE MIRROR SHE PUT ON THE HEAD
2) WHITE LIES: THE COMPUTER MADE ME DO IT
Next come all the leetle w hite lies about how 
such -an d -su ch  is th e com puter’s fault and not 
your decision. T hus the computer is made a 
General Scapegoat at the sam e time it's c o v erin g  up 
for what somebody w ants to do anyway.
"It has to be this w ay."
"T h ere’s nothing we can do; this is all 
handled by com puter."
"T he com puter will not allow th is ."
"The computer won’t let u s."
The translation la. of c o u rse . THE STINKY LOUSY 
PROGRAM DOES NOT PERMIT IT. Which means In 
turn; W E DO NOT CHOOSE TO PROVIDE, IN OUR 
PROGRAMS AND EQUIPMENT. ANY ALTERNATIVES.
Now .  it la often the case that good and 
sufficient reason ex ists for th e way th in g s a re  done. 
But It is also often the case that companies and the 
public are inconvenienced, or w orse, by deciaions 
the computer people make and then hide with th eir 
claim of technical necessity (See p . f t : Dealing 
with computer p eople.)More a g g re ssiv e ly , cy b ercru d  Is a technique 
for m aking p eople do w hat you w an t. "T he com­
puter re q u ire s it,"  you say ,  and so people c an  be 
made to hand o v e r p ersonal Information, se c re ta rie s 
can be intim idated into scou rin g  the files, paym ent 
schedules can be artificially en fo rce d .
THE GENERAL STATUS TRICK
Statue tr ic k s , com bining the putdow n and 
th e se lf-b o o st, date back to times Immemorial.
But today they take new form s. T he big g est tric k  
is to elevate y o u rself and demean lhe listen er at 
th e sam e tim e, o r ,  more gen erally , the technique 
is making people feel stupid w hile acting like a 
b ig  c h e e s e .  T h us someoneone m ight s a y ,
"People must begin to gel used to th e  o b jec­
tiv e scientific w ay s of d oing th in g s 
that com puters now make n e c e ssa ry .” 
But the tran slatio n  seems lo be:
"People must get used to the Inflexible,
b adly thought o u t, Inconvenient and 
u n k in d  system s that 1  and other 
self-rig h teo u s individuals and com­
panies a re  inflicting on th e w o rld ."
YOU DON’T ALWAYS GOTTA
T h e uninform ed are b u lld o z e d . and ev en  
the inform ed a re  p r e s s u r e d , by the foolish m yths 
of th e c lev e r, implacable and scientific com puter 
to which they m ust adapt. People a re  told they 
h ave to "relate to the com puter." But actually 
they are b e in g  made to relate lo system s hum ans 
h ave d esigned around It, in much the same way 
a sword dance Is designed around the sw o rd .
When establishm ent com puter people say 
that the com pu ter req u ire s you to be system atic, 
they gen erally  mean you have to learn  th e ir sy ste m .  
But anyone who tells you a method "has to be 
changed for the com puter” is u sually fibbing -  
He p refers to ch sn g e the method for the co m p u te r,  
T he reaso n s may be bad o r good. Often the 
com puter salesm an or Indoctrinalor will presen t 
as "scientific" tech n iq u es w hich w ere doped out 
o r whomped u p  by a couple of g u y s in  the back 
room.
H ere is an ex am p le,  as told to me. A frien d  
of mine w orked in a d ress factory w here ihey had 
a perfectly good system  for billing and bookkeeping. 
C uatom ers w ere listed by name and kept in  a lp h a­
betical o rd e r. T h e fast pace of the garm ent in d u s­
try  meant th at companies often changed nam es, and 
SO v arious com panies had a num ber of different 
names in the file. T his bothered nobody b ecause 
the people understood the system .
Then management bought a sm all com puter, 
n e v er mind w hat b ran d , and hired a couple o f g u y s
lo come in  and pu t th e bookkeeping system  o n  it.
Still o k ay . Indeed, small program m ing firms 
can sometim es do th is so rt of th in g  v e ry  w e ll,  
because they can  w ork flexibly w ilh the people 
and don't n ecessarily  feel committed lo m aking it 
w ork a certain  w ay.
W ell.  th is was a nice instance w h ere  the 
e x istin g  system  could have been exactly tran s­
ferred  lo th e com puter. T h e fact that some custom ­
e rs had sev eral names would certainly have been 
no problem : a pro g ram  could have been w ritten 
lhat allowed u s e rs  lo type any acceptable custom er 
name, cau sin g  lhe com puter to look up th e c o rrec t 
account (and if d e sire d , p rin t its usual name and

Some of the computer high-chool kids I've 
known. because of Iheir youth. have been even 
more up-fronl about this than adults.
1  know one boy. for instance, whose dream 
was to put a 33ASR Teletype on wheels under 
radio control, and alarm people at the computer 
conference by having it roll up to them and clatter 
out questions impersonally.  (If you knew the kid 
-- aloof and haughty-seeming-- you might think 
that's how he approaches people in real life.)
I know a high-school boy (nol a computer 
expert) who programmed a computer to type out 
a love story •  using the BASIC "print" command, 
the only one he knew. He could not bring 
himself lo write the love story on paper.
The besi example I can think of. though, 
took place at the kids' booth (see p .H -'J )  at a 
computer conference. One of the more withdrawn 
girls was silting al an off-line video terminal, 
idly typing things onto the screen. When she 
had gone a sentence remained. It said:
I love you all. but at a distance.
(On the other side of Ihis book, Dream 
Machines, we will carry this matter further. 
The most exciting things in the computer field 
are coming from people trying to realize their 
wildest dreams by computer: artificial Intel­
ligence. computer music, computer picture* 
making and so on.)

F orget w hat y o u 'v e  e v e r h ea rd  o r im agined 
about co m p u ters. J u s t c o n sid e r this:
The computer is the most general machine  
man has ever developed. Indeed, it should be  
called the All-Purpose Machine, but isn ’t, for  
reasons of historical accident (see n ea rb y ).  
Computers can control, and receive information  
from, virtually any other machine. The computer  
is not like a bomb or a gun, which can only d es­
troy , but more like a typew riter, wholly non­
committal between good and bad in its nature.
The scope of what computers can do is breath­
taking. Illustrated are some examples (although  
having all this happen on one computer would be  
unusual). It can turn things on and off, ring  
b e lls , put out fir e s , type out on printing m achines.
Computers are incredibly dogged. Compulers  
can do things repeatedly forever, or an exact,  
immense number of times (like 4,9 0 1 ,2 2 3 ), doing  
something over and over, depending on whether  
it's finished or not. A computer's activities  
can be combined in remarkable w a y s. One activity,  
repeated over and o ver, can be part of another  
activity repeated over and o v e r , which can be  
a part of still another activity, which can be  
repeated ad infinitum. THERE ARE DEFINITE  
LIMITATIONS on what computers can do, but  
they are not easy to describe b riefly. A lso, some  
of them are argued about among computer people.

A HELPFUL COMPARISON
It helps sometimes to compare computers with typew riters.  
Both handle information according to som ebody's own viewpoint.
Nervous Question
"Can a Computer
Write a Poem?"
"Can't Computers Only
Behave Mechanistically?'
"Aren't Computers
Completely Impersonal?'Helpful Parallel
"Can a Typewriter  
Write a Poem?"
(Sure. Your poem .)
"Can't Typew riters Only
Behave M echanistically?”
(Y es, but carrying  
out your intent.)
"Aren't Typewriters
Completely Impersonal?"
(Well, it's not like handwriting,  
but it's still what you s a y .)Many ordinary people find compulers  
intuitively obvious and understandable;  
only the complications elude them. Perhaps  
these intuitively helpful definitions may help  
your intuition as w e ll.
1. Think of the computer as a
WIND-UP CROSSWORD PUZZLE.
2. A COMPUTER IS A DEVICE FOR  
TWIDDLING INFORMATION. (So. whal kinds  
of information are there? And what are the  
tw iddling options? T hese matters are what  
the computer field consists o f .)
3. A computer is a com pletely general

THE MAGIC OF THE COMPUTBR PROGRAM
The basic, central magical Interior device 
of the computer we shall call a program follower.
A program follower ia an electronic device (usually) 
which reads symbols specifying operations, carries 
out the step each specifies and goes on to the next.
The program follower reads down the list 
of instructions In the program, taking each Instruction 
In turn and carrying It out before It goes on to 
the next.
Now , there are program followers that Just 
do that and nothing more; they have to stop when 
they get to the end of the list of Instructions.
A true computer, however, can do several 
things more.
11 can Jump back to an earlier point 
In the program and go on from there. Repeating 
the program In this fashion Is called a loop.
It can perform tests on symbols In 
the memory— for Instance. to see if a loop 
has been done enough times, or If some other 
part of the Job has been finished— and Jump 
to some other program depending on these 
symbols. This la called a branch.
Finally, the computer can change 
the Information stored in memory. For Instance, 
It can place an answer In a specific part 
of memory.
WHAT, THEN. IS A (Digital) COMPUTER?
A device holding stored symbols 
In a changeable memory, 
performing operations on some of those symbols 
in the memory.
In s sequence specified by other symbols 
In the memory. 
able to change the sequence
based on tests of symbols In the memory, 
and able to change symbols in the memory.
(For example, do arithmetic and 
store the result In the memory.)
Rather than try to slip It to you or prove 
it In some fancy way, let's Just state baldly: the 
power of such a machine to do almost anything 
surpasses all previous technical tricks in human 
history.
H O W  CAN A COMPUTER CONTROL
SO M ANY DIFFERENT THINGS?
Answer. Different as they may seem, all 
devices are controlled In the same way. Every 
device has an Interface, that la, its own special 
connection setup, and In this Interface are the 
device registers.
These device registers look the same to the 
computer: the computer program simply moves 
Information patterns Into them or moves information 
patterns from them to see what they contain.Co M O T E
I V i T C t W *
--— particular symbolic signals 
the device needsr heart patient 
oil refinery 
musical Instrument 
display screen 
disk memory
The computer, being a machine, doesn't  
know or care that device register 17 (say) controls  
a hog feeder, or device register 23 (aay) receives  
Information from smog detectors. But what you  
choose, in your program, to put Into device register  
17, controls what the hogs eat, and what comes  
into device register 29 w ill tell your program,  
you hope, about smog conditions. Choosing how  
to handle these things in your program la your  
business.The computer does things over and over 
by changing a stored count, then testing the stored 
count against another number which Is what the 
count should get to, and going to the beginning 
If the desired count has not been resched. This 
is called a loop. (If there's no way 1 1  can ever 
get out, that's an endless loop.) (Actually, the 
program loop Is done the same way as a program 
branch: IF a certain count has not been reached,
It branches BACK to the start of the loop.)
Other things besides programs msy be stored 
In the memory. Anything besides programs are 
usually called d ata.
**■
The Instructions of programs use the data in different 
ways. Some programs use a lot of data, some use 
a little, some don't use any. It is one of the fascinating 
and powerful things about the computer that both 
the instructions of a program. and the data they work 
on, are stored as patterns of bits in Ihe same memory, 
where they can be modified as needed. Indeed, the 
program can modify its own patterns of bits, a very 
Important feature.
WHAT DO PROGRAMS LOOK LIKE?
In what forms are these programs stored,  
you ask? Well, they are written by people in computer 
languages, which are then stored in some form in 
the computer's fast core memory, where the program 
follower can act on them. But what does a computer 
language look like, you ask? A ha...

(If you want to see what the bottom-most level looks 
like, with all the bits and things,  skip ahead to p.ST.)
(WHATEVER IT M A Y  DO tN THE REAL WORLD, 
to the computer program
it’s just another device.
ANALOG COMPUTERS DISPOSED OF
There are two kinds of computers: analog 
and digital. (Also hybrid. meaning a combination.) 
Analog computers are so unimportant compared to 
digital computers that we will polish them ofT In 
a couple of paragraphs.
"Analog" Is a shortened form of the word 
"analogy." Originally an "analog" computer was 
one that represented something In the real world 
by some other sort of physical enactment— for 
Instance, building a model of an economic system 
with tubes and liquids: this can demonstrate 
Keynesian economic principles remarkably well.
However, the term "analog" haa come to mean 
almost exclusively pertaining to measurable 
electrical signals, and an "analog computer" is 
a device that creates or modifies measurable 
electric signals. Thus a hi-fi amplifier Is an 
analog computer (It multiplies the signal), a music 
synthesizer is an analog computer (it generates 
snd reshapes analog signals). Thus the term has 
deteriorated: almost anything with wires is an 
analog computer.
Analog computers cannot be truly programmed, 
only rewired.
Analog equipment le useful, important and 
Indispensable. But it is simply not In the same 
class with digital computers, henceforth called 
"computers" In this book, which manipulate symbols 
on the basis of changeable symbolic programs.
"Analog computer" also means any way of 
calculating that involves measuring approximate 
readings, like a slide ru le.

You would think the fundamental dichotomy 
among computer terminal* was between those that 
print on p»p«r and thoae lhat ahow you muff on 
.sc re en . Bul It lan't. (That's like the difference 
between people and whalea-- much grealer outside 
lhan Inelde.)
Actually the fundamental distinction between 
terminals la between ASCII (pronounced "Aakey") 
and IBM  terminals. ASCII is a code and scheme 
of organization which was adopted by "the Indus­
try under the bleaslng of the National Bureau 
of Standards. But IB M  has pointedly Ignored ihlB  
standard.
The principal terminal of the ASCII type.
In sheer numbers , Is Ihe model 33-ASR Teletype 
(trademark of Teletype C orp. ) . so this kind of 
terminal Is called the "33 ASR type," o r "Teletype- 
type.” or We even say a given terminal "looks 
to the computer like a Teletype."
IBM . however, aeema to like changing Its 
systems around a lot. for Instance changing Its 
codes when It brings out s new compuier, (For- 
tunstely. It Just happens lhat they also Sell sdap- 
lers between them. Whew.) So IBM-type terminals 
are different by design.
There Is one main type, however, exem­
plified by the IBM  model 2741 terminal. Thus we 
say a terminal Is an "IBM-type" or "2741-type" 
terminal.
Indeed, even the Selectric (IBM  trademarly. 
? -  [' typing mechanism appears in some 
Teletype-type terminals -
There Is s very Important performance 
difference between ASCII and IB M  terminals.
The ASCII terminal can send each character typed 
by the user- - each "keystroke”-- lo the o>mpuier 
immediately.  This means lhat highly responsive 
programs can be written, which examine the user's 
Input and can reply Instantaneously. It need be, 
after anything the user types.
IBM-type terminals. however, require »
"line feed" character or an "end of transmission” 
character lo be typed by the user to make it Ihe 
computer'a tu rn ,  This locks the keyboard so (he 
person can't use 1 1 . Then the computer must type 
some)hing, ending with lla own "unlock" signal 
thal makes It the person's turn again.
W hy this unwieldy design? Supposedly it 
results from the curious decision.  in the design 
of IBM's 380 compuier. to make all devices 
r—emble the card reader as far as ihe computer 
Is concerned. Just as ihe card reader reads 
punched carda till the last one Is done, the IBM  
terminal la designed to send and receive characters 
until a "finished" condition Is reached.T & W H A y
' f o O  O I C C .
All are ASCII-type unless otherwise noted.
Nole: there are hundreds of types and 
brands of terminals available.  These are Just 
some thoughts.

If you like Selectrlcs, but want to go to ASCII, 
there Is one weird possibility.
A  firm called Tycom Systems Corporation 
(26 Just Road, Fairfield N Y  07006) offers an 
Interesting alternative, it happens thal all Selec- 
Irlcs (anyway. Model 1  and Mbdel 11) have a seam 
around the midriff at which Ihe lypewrlier can 
be unscrewed into two sections. Clever Tycom! 
They make s device which fils between, looks io 
the bottom like the top of ihe Selectric, and looks 
to (he top like the bottom. Also, it turns the 
Selectric into a terminal, receiving ASCII codes 
from whatever computer you attach it to and 
causing the compuier to type them, o r aendlng out 
whal you type lo Ihe computer In ASCII.
Curiously, IB M  has given its blessing to 
this arrangement, meaning you can have (his 
sandwich deal done to a Selectric you rent from 
IBM  ,  and serviced under beefed-up IBM  mainten­
ance agreements ($72 per year, or $16.50 per hour, 
as of 1970).

The earlier video terminals camo wilh 
dreadful styling, like a 1940s science-fiction 
movie. But as an example of how the market Is 
developing, one of the handsomest video terminals 
Is the $1300 Mini-Tec from TEC Incorporated.
9800 North Oracle Road,  Tucson. Arl*. 85704.
It comes covered with wood-grain contact paper
and looks very nice. (You should have seen 
their early models.)
The Hazeltlne 1000 video terminal rents 
for $49/mo. on s l-year contract. LOWER-CASE

included. (Hazelline, Green lawn. NY 11740,

if you have no objection to ITT. they offer 
a portable video terminal wilh built-in modem

They've already sel up travelling terminals (or

Various firms rent terminals, some on a 
Short-lcrm basis. (Some terminal companies 
are bad news, keeping up their equipment badly 
and offering poor service, so watch it.)
(The day will come, let's hope it's soon, 
thal you can rent a terminal overnight or for a 
weekend like a movie earners. But till people 
get a sense of how far and fast things are moving, 
we'll continue to schlock along haphazardly,)
Unfortunately rental people are hard io find, 
since (hey are usually local, and the Yellow Pages 
idiotically lump together every possible form of 
compuier sales and service under "Dala Processing 
Equipment and Supplies." and few firms further 
specify their business In the listing.

A  good outfit, lhal renis both ASCII and

Anderson Jacobson Co. (1065 Morse A ve,,

have a Selectric terminal, for instance, which 
rents for about $100 a month (about the same as 
Ihe standard IBM 2741) but is portable-
To provide a memory with your ASCII or JBM- 
IBM-type terminal, an odd machine called the 
Techtran 4100 (about $1000 from Techtran Indus­

be used for offline storage. It uses s magnetic

The question of whether the Techtran can be used 
with Ihe Digi-Log has noi been publicly resolved.
It happens lhal Anderson Jacobson (above) 
will rent you iheir 2741-type Selectric terminal, 
with a Techtran ,  for about $220 a monlh lotal.
But they won't rent the Techtran separately,
A 2741-type Selectric terminal with memory, 
offering these same capabilities, is now available 
from IBM! II is the Communicaling Mag Card 
Executive (CMC). Since Ihe Mag Card Executive, 
to which they have added Ihe communication 
feature, cosis over $200 a monlh, figure ihe 
communication feature could cost another $100 
or 30 monthly, or probably half again as much 
as the Anderson-Jacobson .
Honeywell (Honeywell Information Systems,

A  very hot Item rlghi now Is a terminal 
called Ihe "Digi-Log"-- actually several different 
models-- available from Digi-Log Sysiems, Inc., 
666 Davisvllle Rd. , Willow Grove, P*. 19090.
This device fits in a briefcase. Basically
Il is a keyboard with a socket for ihe phone, 
and an antenna wire. You phone the computer, 
drop ihe phone handsel In the slot, and clip the 
wire lo (he antenna of a TV s e l,  Presto! On ihe 
TV set appears whal you and Ihe computer type 
at each other.
This is especially good for travelling 
salesmen (to communicate wilh their offices and 
ordering system via time-sharing computer) 
and executives who do compuier work from the 
road.  Also for people who want to show off 
remote computer sysiems.
Disadvantage: only 42 characters per line, 
which is awkward for some things, such as 
programming In Fortran.
Price: $1200 to $1400, They alao lease, al

Ann Arbor Terminals , Inc. (Ann Arbor.

The equivalent IBM-type terminal-- keyboard, 
coupler and d ip  to the TV-- Is the IPSA-100, 
offered by I.P. Sharp Associates, Inc. (Bridge 
Administration Building, Bridge Plaza, Ogdensburg, 
NY 13669). Unfortunately it's much larger than 
the Digi-Log-- ll comes In a medium-size sullcsse 
-- end more expensive ($1700 up), However, 
they offer ihe APL character-aet (see APL under 
"Magic Languages," «s an option— even
a model with bolh normal and APL character-sela 
as a switch-selectable option (costs even more).
Recently, of all things , plans for a do-it- 
yourself unit of rhis type were announced in a 
popular electronics magazine (Don Lancaster,
"TV Typewriter," Radio-Electron Ice, Sept. 1973, 
43-52), Thia does nol include the full plans, 
which are available for $2 from TV TYPEWRITER ,  
Radio-Electronic s , 45 E. I7lh Si.. New York.
NY 10003-
Supposedly this can be built tor "around 
$120"-- probably a deal more- - if you a re a  skilled 
electronics builder or technician. But lhal looks 
to include a great deal of labor.
The finished unit holds up to 32 characters 
per line and up to 16 lines on the screen; a second 
memory can be added, lo hold a second alternative 
screenful.

are what make computers go 'round.
I F  your computer only did one thing, 
then to start It you'd only need one button to 
press.
If your computer only did two dozen 
things, without variations, then you could 
let each operation bo started by pressing 
one of the Keys of the terminal, and thal 
would be lhat.
But that's not what ifa about.
W e have lots of different things lhAt we 
want computers 10 do. and we want one com­
mand lo work on different varieties of dala. or 
on the results of a previous command. or even
lo chew on another command Itself; and so e  
computer language Is a conlrlved method of 
giving commands to a computer lhat allows 
the commands lo be enlwlned In a complex fashion,
This means having basic operations that 
can be built into bigger operations (routines, 
subroutines, subprograms, programs).

Everyone 9hould have some brush with 
computer programming, jusl lo see what it Is 
and isn't, Whai ii is: casting mystical spells 
in arcane terminology, whose exact details 
have exact ramifications.  Whai II isn't: talking 
or typing to the computer in some way that re­
quires Intelligence by lhe machine. Whai ll la: 
an intricate technical a n . Whai it isn'l: science.
Why three languages? Because one would 
look loo much alike. Only by perusing several 
do you get any sense of the variety they take.
T hese th re e  languages make i t  p o s s ib le

Why theae three? Several good reasons.
One, they can be used from a terminal, which 
means lhal you could in principle get a terminal 
In your home and play wilh the computer from 
over lhe telephone. Bui this is expensive, 
and al worsl fraught with accidental financial 
liabilities, so the possibility Is minor right now, 
Nevertheless, il should be practical and inex­
pensive fairly soon.These languages have been c h o sen  b e ­

Another reason for these three: they 
represent. In a way. several major types,
BASIC is a widespread and fairly standard 
language-- lhal is, it is available on computers 
everywhere. Moreover, ll looks rather like 
Fortran,  which is the most important "scientific" 
computer language.
TRAC Language, though well-known among 
researchers, has mighty powers that are not so 
well known.  Moreover, it achieves its powers 
through lha simple and highly consistent following 
ot a few simple principles, and is thus both very 
eaay to learn and an elegant intellectual triumph 
for Its inventor.
Moreover, il ia a so-called "lisi language." 
meaning thal it can handle Information having 
extremely varied and changing form-- a very 
Important feature lo those of ua interested in 
computer applications like picture-making and 
text handling, which use amorphous and busy 
types of data. (See "Data Structures.” p p -2 & ->
APL is another elegant language,  also 
worked oul handsomely from certain basic ideas 
by a very thoughtful and inspired inventor.In the contemplation of these three lan­
guages you may begin lo see the influence of 
the Individual human mind in the computer field, 
quite contrary to the stereotype. I would like
lo stress here lhal each of these three languages 
represents somebody's Individual personal ach­
ievement. and is in turn a foundation upon 
which others, writing programs, can build

IF YOU'RE SCARED. Don't w orry, ll'a 
not a test. Flip the pages and look at lhe exam­
ples. (In particular, you might look for lhe 
same program which appears in each language: 
a program to cause the computer to print 
"HELP, I  AM  TRAPPED IN  A LOOP" forever.)

T h e  BASIC la n g u a g e , also called D a rtm o u th -B u te ,
» u  in tro d u ced  In the six tie s at D artm outh College by  Jo h n  
K aneny an d  T hom as K urt*. It waa Intended to be a sim ple 
and e a sy -to -le * m  Intro d u ctio n  to com puter p rogram m ing, 
y e t pow erful enough to do u se fu l th in g s . It h a s g row n in  
u s e , In rec en t y e a r s , both a s the forem ost b e g in n e r's la n g u ag e , 
a n d  a s  a perfectly fine la n g u ag e  for doing m any sim ple 
k ind* of w o rk — like custom  b u sin e ss applicatio n s, sta tistics, 
and "good-guy" system s for nfliv« u s e rs  os d isc u sse d  elsew h e re  
In th is book.
Ksnvsny Is now p re sid e n t of D artmouth, and K urtz 
r u n s  th e ir hlg h -p o w er tim e -sh a rin g  com puter c e n te r , so 
BASIC has ■  p erm anent hom e b ase th ere.
Note lhat the name BASIC does nol refer to th e  bottom - 
level or elonental lan g u ag e s of co m puters. BASIC has 
b een c o n triv ed  specifically to make program m ing q u ic k er 
an d  e asie r. II la not " b asic" to all com puters; su ch  bottom 
languages a re  called "m achine la n g u ag e ” o r "assem bler 
language" (see P P . j 2.-_jl
The sim plicity of the la n g u ag e begins st the p rogram  
In p u t, or ed itin g , lev el. E ach  command rf BASIC m ust 
be on a separate lin e , an d  each lin e must have s separate 
line nu m b er. Suppose y o u  accidentally type in
S O  IMPUGN Y
w hen you maant "INPUT" In stead  of "IMPUGN." You may 
rep lace that command at an y  time by ty p in g  the same line 
num b er and the new v e rsio n  of the lin e ,
50 INPUT Y
which autom atically rep la ce s the previoualy line 50. if 
you wont to get ria  of the lin e e n tire ly , you type
50
and an end-o f-lin e c o d e, a n d  the whole line Is gone.
Example of a BASIC command:
153 L B T X = Y
You can choose any line n u m b e rs you w an t, b u t the lin e s 
are autom atically p u t L n  th e  o rd e r of th eir n u m b e rs . Sin ce 
w hen you w rite a p rogram  yo u  d o n 't usually know at th e  
outset what it will look lik e la te r, you try  to le av e  e nough 
gaps In the n u m b ers st th e  s ta r t to fit in the In structions 
you might w ant to p ut b e tw ee n  them later.
THE SETTING
To b egin w ilh . th e re  m ust be a co m p u ter, and it 
m ust have a p ro cesso r for the BASIC lan g u ag e, that is , 
a program  for c a rry in g  oul the operations of D artm outh- 
BASIC We will assum e that th is BASIC p ro cesso r is  all 
sat u p  in care memory r e a d y  to g o .
(Note: T his is how It looks 
In a m inicom puter. On 
a tim e-sh a rin g  system  th e re 's  
a lot of irrele v an t other 
stuff going o n , w hich w e'll 
leave o u t.)
And we will a ssu m e , as p re v io u s ly  m entioned, th at you 
have some k ind frf a te rm in a l-- that Is, a device w ith a  k e y b o a r d ,  
some kind of place the co m p u ter can send m essag es to you 
and vice v e rs a , and is m ore o r le ss sta n d a rd .
Now then: ail that ts n eed ed  is for you to u n d e rstan d  
the BASIC lan g u ag e, and you can program  th is com puter 
w ithin the confines of BA SIC .
• ♦ I t  la one of the s tra n g e  a spects of th is field th a t 
lan gu a g es can be taught Indep en d en tly  erf d isc u ssio n s of 
the m achine itself.W hen you type ln a p ro g ra m , the BASIC p ro ce sso r 
w ill d o  c e rta in  th in g s to it (actually cook It d o w n ) an d  store 
it in c o re  m emory:
E v ery  time you change one erf the lines of the p ro g ram  th e  
BASIC p ro c e sso r w ill In sert, delete or re p la c e  lines as 
you h av e com m anded, then re a rra n g e  w h a te v e r’8 left a cc o rd in g ly , 
in  o rd e r of the line n um bers.
T h e n  w hen you tell the p ro cesso r to s ta r t the p ro g ra m . 
b y  ty p in g  (w ith no line num ber)
RUN
the p ro c e sso r will sta rt the p rogram  g o ing at the command 
with the e a rlie st line n u m b er, and y o u r In stru ctio n s w ill 
be ex ec u ted  a cco rd in g  to the r u le s  of BA SIC.
Now we will co n sid er some of the com m ands (or statem ents) 
of BASIC.T he END command
The END command In BASIC sim ply consists of the 
w ord END. It m ust came last ln the p ro g ra m . Therefore 
It m ust have the high est lin e n u m b e r. Example:
00 END
The PRINT command
W henever the p ro g ram  follow er gets to a PRINT command,  
it p rin ts out o n  the term inal w h atev e r is specified. Example:
97 PRINT "HAIL CAESAR. BIRD THOU NEVER WERT"
When and if the p rogram  follow er gete lo th is command, 
the term inal w ill p r in t out
HAIL CAESAR . BIRD THOU NEVER WERT
The GOTO command (pro n o u n ced  "Go 2")
T he GOTO command te lls the p ro g ram  follow er the 
n um ber of the n ext command for It to d o , from which It 
w ill go o n . Example:
02 GOTO 90
which m eans thal w hen a p ro g ra m  follow er g e ts to command 
#02, it m ust next Jump lo 06 an d  go on from  th e re , unless 
thal h ap p en s to be the END statem en t.
A SIMPLE SAMPLE PROGRAM
T hese are enough com m ands lo w rite  a sample p ro g ram .
43 PRINT "HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP"
87 GOTO 43
ee end
The program  w ill s ta r t at the first In stru c tio n , which 
h a p p en s in this case to be in stru c tio n  n u m b e r 43. That 
one p r in ts  a m e ssa g e . The n e x t com m and, b y  lin e n u m b e r,  
is 67. T h is telle the p ro g ram  follow er lo go b ack  to 43, 
w hich it does.
43 PRINT "HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP" < -1
= P *  67 GOTO 4 3 --------------------------------------------------------- 1
08 END
The resu lt Is that your term inal w ill p rin t
HELP , 1  AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP 
HELP. I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP 
HELP , I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP
Interm inably, or until you do som ething d r a s tic . It n e v er 
gets to the END statem ent. (Two stra te g ie s for doing som ething 
d rastic  are usually to hold dow n the CONTROL button and 
type C , o r hold down both CONTROL and SHIFT b u tto n s .
If you have them , and type P . One of these u su a lly  w o rk s .)
The LET command
The LET command puts som ething Into a v a ria b le .
Example:
43 LET R = 2 .3
Whal Is on the right side of the equals sig n  in the lo st s ta te m e n t, 
In th is case 2 .3. Is stuffed Into w hatever location of core 
memory Is designated on the left sid e . In th is case a place 
known to you only as R. With the resu lt th a t som eplace 
In c o re  memory is
The LET statem ent is an exam ple of an a ssig n m e n t sta te m en t, 
which most computer lan g u ag e s have; an a ssig n m e n t statem ent 
assig n s a specific piece of Inform ation (often a n u m b e r, 
but often other th ings) to some name (often sta n d in g  fo r 
a p a rticu la r place In core m em ory) .
The LET command L n  BASIC can also be u se d  to  d o 
a rith m etic . Example;
14 LET M  = 2.3 + (12*7009.1)
(The asterisk  h as to be u sed for m ultiplication because 
traditionally term inals d on't have a tir o e s -s ig n .) BASIC 
will w ork this out from rig h t to left and sto re  the re su lt 
In M.
The INPUT command
The INPUT statem ent a sk a  the p e rso n  st the term inal 
for a num ber and then sh oves it into a v a ria b le . Example:
41 INPUT Z
w hich cau se s the term inal to type a q u e stio n  m a rk , and 
w a it. When the u s e r has ty p e d  ln a n u m b e r followed by 
a c a rria g e  r e tu r n , the BASIC p ro c e sso r stuffs the num ber 
into the v a ria b le  and p ro c e e d s w ith the p ro g ra m . Here 
Is a program  u sin g  the INPUT statem ent.T hese two boys had n e v er seen a com puter before, 
but I loaded It up wilh the BASIC language p ro ce sso r, 
showed them a few basic commands and told them to 
tu rn  It off w hen they were through.
1  got back ten hour* later and they w ere Still a t it.
Too bad kids have such short attention Span9.
VARIABLES
T he BASIC la nguage, like a num ber of other languages, 
allow s you lo set aside places in core memory a n d  give 
them nam es. T hese places may hold n u m b e rs . T h ey  can 
be u se d  to count the num ber of tim es that th in g s a re  done 
(or not d o n e ) , to hold o n sw e rs, num bers to te st a g a in s t,  
num bers to m ultiply by and so on.
In  BASIC, these places a re  given nam es of one a lphabe ti­
c al le tte r. T hai m eans you can have up to 20 of them . 
Exam ples:
A E I 0  U sometimes Y even X
B ecause these named spaces in m emory may be u sed 
som ething like the way le tte rs are used in  a lg e b ra , we 
^■11 them v a ria b le s . In fact, each one Is a place with a

if you u se the names B ,C and D fo r v a ria b le s in y our 
p r o g ra m , th e  BASIC p ro ce sso r will autom atically set u p

"Jfe"PRINT "HOW OLD ARE YOU"
INPUT A 
LET B e A /40.0
1  25 PRINT "YOUR AGE IS", B , "TMBS THE AGE 
OF THE EMPIRE 9TATE BU1LDINO."
30 END
T his will cause Um following to happen:
Program types:
HOW OLD ARE YOU? JO
n i-r
Program types:
YOUR AGE IS .5 TIMES THE AGE OP THE EMPIRE 
STATE BUILDING.
The IF command
T he IF command Is a way of testing w hat's stored 
In a v a riab le. Example:
8 8 IF M  - 40 then 63
Thla leate v ariable M  to see If it contains the num ber 40.
If M la indeed 40. the program  follower jumps to line 63.
If n o t, It goes right on and takee the nezl higher Instruction 
after 88. T he IF can teet other relations lhan equality, 
Including "leas lh at." " g reater than." "not eq u al," "less 
than o r equal to ,” etc. For instance.
89 IF Q 7 then 102
will send the program  follower to command 75 If variable 
q  contains a num ber less than 7. (Note thal different BASICS 
for different computers may have slightly different rules 
h e re .)
The BASIC language, developed si Dsrtmouth, must not be 
confused wilh the u nderlying binary languagea of Individual 
computera (see "Rock Bottom,” p.3<V). These underlying 
codes sre  called "maehlne languages" (o r. In e d reseed-up 
form , easier to use for p rogram m ers, "assem bler language"). 
These a re  the basic lan g u ag e s. different for each m achine. 
Dartmouth BASIC, or Jut plain Basic, Is a widely svailable. 
stand ard ized . simple b e g in n er's Isnguage.
V r
ANOTHER PROFOUND EXEMPLARY PROGRAM 
LET Z = 25
r - - *  82
; aau— * 74PRINT Z. " BOTTLES OF BEER tN THE WALL” 
LET Z = Z - 1  
IF Z = 0 GOTO 74
GOTO 1 0 --------------------------------------------------------- n
The program  will start typing thusly:
n . until Z has reached 0; then It will type
and then it will stop.
You w ill note that this program , like the one that 
prin ted  "HELP. 1  AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP." has a loop, 
that is, a repeated sequence of operations. The first one 
w as an en d less loop, which repeated fo rev er. Thla loop, 
ho w ev er. Is more w ell-behaved (by some p s p l e 's  sta n d ard s). 
In that it allows an escape w hen a certain criterio n  has 
been reach ed -*  In this c ae e , p rinting a line of teat 25 times 
with v a ria n le .
The reason we a re  able lo escape from thla loop is 
that we have s test Instruction, IF slstement num ber 62.
It Is v ery important for lhe programmer lo Include 
testa which allow the program  to gel out of a loop. This 
may be couched aa a motto, v iz.:
LEAK BEFORE YOU LOOP.
AN AUTOMATIC LOOP
Indeed, for people who a re  b ig on program  loops.
BASIC p rovides a pair of Instructions which handle the 
program  loop com pletely. T hese a re  the FOR and NEXT 
Instru ctio n s. We w on't show them h e re , but th ey 're not 
v e ry  h a rd . U sing the FOR command. you can eaaUy direct 
the computer lo do something a million and one lim es, aay. 
Thla can be eih lla ra tln g . You can even direct it lo Include 
that program  in something to be done a billion tim es. resulting 
In s program  loop lhat would be carried  out o ver a trillion 
lim es. All In a short program ! Bui of course this is Just 
pow er on p aper; we want o u r program s lo be useful, and 
finlah th eir joba In lhe p rese n t c en tu ry , and so such flights 
a re  Just menial e x ercises.
FAST ANSWERBACK WITH BASIC (In some v ersions)
If you went a  teat an sw er to a  numerical q uestion. 
you can do It without the line n u m bers. typing In
PRINT 3.1416*7124
will cause BASIC to p rin t lhe answ er right oul and forget 
the w to le thing.
TEXT STRINGS IN BASIC
T he d e lu ie  versions of the Dartmouth BASIC 
language have operations for handling texl-- 
o r what computerfolk call " strin g s,” that la. 
strin g s of alphabetic ch aracters and punctuation.  
These operations lend to begin with $ (standing 
for "String”?) and Ihere'a no room for them h e re .
Bui what they mean is that BASIC can type 
le tte rs, count the nouns In Gone With The Wind, 
o r p rin t out the nine hun d red  million names of 
God.BASIC is a v e ry  serious lan g u ag e. A dvanced versions 
of BASIC have instructions that allow u aers to put In alphabetical 
Information, and store and retrieve all kinds of Information 
from disks or tape. In other w ords, BASIC can be used 
for the fairly simple programming of a vaat range of problem s 
and "good-guy system s" mentioned elsew here. Complete 
BASIC systems allowing complex a lc u la tio n s can be had 
for perh ap s 63000; a general-purpose computer running 
BASIC with cassette o r other mass sto rag e, for bualneea 
o r other p u rposes, can now be had for some 66000. Allowing 
a few thousand dollars for programming specific applications 
In BASIC, simple system s can be created for a variety 
of p u rposes that some companies might say you needed 
a hundred-thouaand-dollar system  for.
This Is serious b u sin e ss. Languagea like BASIC 
must be considered by people who want simple systems 
to do understandable things In direct w ays that a re  meaningful 
to th em . and lhat don't dierupt Ihelr companies o r their 
liv e s .
T his has been a very hasty and b rief presentation 
In w hich I have tried lo convey the feeling of Ihls Important 
lan g u ag e. If you have the chance lo learn II. by all means 
do.
SOME FUN THINGS TO TRY IN BASIC
Write a  program  that p rin ts cale n d ars.
Write a program  lhat converts an Input number to 
Roman N umerals.
Write a dialogue eyston that welcomes the u se r to 
the sanitarium , asks him questions, Ignores the answ ers 
and Insults him. (Use lhe INPUT ststement for receiving 
numerical a n sw e rs. Since the anaw era a re  Ignored they 
can all be stored In one v arisb le .)
WHERE TO GET IT
(Features of the BASIC language v ary conalderably 
from system  lo sy ste m . Which ones offer the highly desirable 
alphabetic commands and mass slorsge have to be checked 
oul Individually.)
BASIC is offered on many If not most lim e-sharing se rv ice s, 
so you can use il from your home on a term inal. (Bui note Ihst 
thia can be expensive and even dan g ero u s. If you’re paying 
yourself; there a re  not presently adequate cost safeguards lo 
p revent you from running up huge b ills .)
BEST BUY? Rumors p ersist of a tim e-sharing service 
somewhere thst offers BASIC for $5 an h o u r, totsl, with disk 
storage thrown In. I  have not been able to verify Ihls.
DEC offers minicomputer-based system s which llme- 
sh are BASIC among several term inals sim ultaneously. (Bui 
you have to buy the whole big sy stem .) The ones that 
ru n  on the PDP-8 a re  marketed mainly to achools, and for 
thla reason a re  c alled , somewhat peculiarly . EDUSYSTEMS 
T h alr multllerm lnal system for lhe PDP-11 Is called R5TS 
(pronounced " R lastlas,") and Is marketed mainly to b usin esses.
H ew lett-Packard offers BASIC, I believe, on all of 
Its minicomputers. Of special Interest Is sn  odd computer 
called the Series 8800 Model 30. Y ou're only allowed to 
program  In BASIC. (It's actually a m icroprocessor; see
p .iv .)
Many other minicomputer m anufacturers now offer 
BASIC. Dsta G eneral's NOVA Is one.

BASIC Is a good example of an "algebraic" type of 
language, that Is. one form ulated more or 
less to look like hlgh-school algebra and 
permit easy conversion of certain algebraic 
formulas into actual runnable p ro g ra m s.
T he mosl w ldely-used language of th is type is 
FORTRAN (see p .3l ) . T hus BASIC Is 
often referred  to as a "Fortran-type language.
T he klckeroo— an d  If you und erstan d  this It's half
lhe battle— Is that a line of BASIC o r FORTRAN 
d irects a certain  event to take place, while 
a statement In algebra Just describ es relations.
The slran g e resem blance between the deacriptlve 
language (algebra) and the p rescriptive 
Isnguage (Fortran o r Basic) Is that algebraic 
operations (which a re  Just recombinations 
and restatem ents) can be mimicked by the 
computer language, and this early obaession 
of mathy compulerfolk led to making the 
computer language look like a descriptive 
alg eb ra. Especially with the w eird use of 
the equ ale-slg n  to mean "Is replaced now b y." 
In hindsight this w as s ridiculous idea; 
some of lhe more recent languagea (such as 
APL) use a left-pointing arrow  Instead of an 
e q u als-alg n . showing that an action Is being 
called fo r. ralh er than a relationship being 
describ ed .AtWYS,
(availablen BASIC, APL and many oth er languages)
A rray s a re  Information setu p s with numbered 
positions. T he positions can contain all so rts of 
different th in g s , however: n u m b e rs, letters or 
other data, depending on the daia stru ctu res 
allowed in the Isnguage.

A one-dim ensional array  is like a row , a two-

dimensions you can't visualize.
A rrays a re  handy for w orking wilh a lot of 
different th in g s one al a lime. They can be given 
names just like variables.
Suppose you have a one-dim ensional array 
named SAM. Then in a program  you can usually 
ask for the th ird  element In SAM by referrin g  lo 
SAM(3). B etter than lhal: you can refer by turns 
to every element of SAM by usin g  a counting

t H e  SLUflHG  GIANr
A mild-mannered man ln Cambridge, M assachusetts,  
who owns his own very sm a ll business, is the creator of one  
of the m ost extraordinary and powerful computer languages  
there Is, ttough lots of people ln the field don't realize It.  
The language Is fairly well-known among professionals, but  
its real power Is hardly suspected.
If BASIC Is a fairly conventional program ming language,  
strongly resem bling FORTRAN, TRAC (Text Reckoning and  
Compiling) Language is fairly unusual.
The name of it is "TRAC Language," not just TRAC —  
because It's a registered brand name (like Kleenex T issu e s).  
Within the rules, the word ’TRAC" is an adjective and not a  
noun. Thus TRAC is its fir st name, Language is its last; so  
w e can refer to "TRAC Language" instead of having to  
precede it with the.
It is included here for several reasons.
1) It is extrem ely easy to learn, at least for beginners.  
Experienced program m ers often have trouble with It.
2) It is extremely powerful for non-numeric tasks. In  
fact, it is ideal for building your own personal language.
3) It offers perhaps the best control of m ass storage,  
and your own style of input-output, of any language.
4) It Is superbly documented and explained with the new  
"The Beginner's Manual for TRAC Language" which is now  
available.
5) It is likely to catch on one of these days. (Some  
large corporations have been investigating it ex ten siv e ly .)
It is not so much the basic idea 
of TRAC Language, bul the neatness 
with which the idea has beerr^elaborated, 
thal is so nice.
As a side point, here is an 
important motto for thinking in general 
about computers (and about other things 
in general):
MAKING THINGS FIT TOGETHER WELL
TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND THOUGHT.
Let Calvin Mooers' TRAC Language be a 
shining example.
TRAC Language is great for creating highly Interactive  
sy stem s for special purposes, Including turnkey sy stem s for  
inexperienced u sers and "good-guy" system s. It combines  
this with good facilities for handling text, and what is needed  
along with that, terrific control over m ass storage. It is  
also excellent for sim ulating complex on-off system s; rumor  
has it that TRAC Language was used for sim ulating a major  
computer before it was built.
Against these advantages we must balance TRAC  
Language's le s s  fortunate characteristics. For num erical  
operations it is extrem ely slow , If not terrible, compared to  
the m ost popular languages. The sam e applies to handling  
num erical arrays and controlling loops, which are com para­
tively awkward in TRAC Language.
Finally, many program m ers are incensed by the  
number of parentheses that turn up in TRAC program s; ln  
this it resem bles the language LISP. But this is an aesthetic  
judgement.
The TRAC Language has been thought out in great  
detail for total com patibility of all parts. (M oreover, by  
standardizing the language exactly, M ooers heroically  
a ssures that program s can be moved from com puter to  
computer without d ifficu lty.)
* TRAC is a registered ser v ice marie of Rockford R esearch,  
Inc. Description of TRAC Language prim itives adapted by  
perm ission from "TRAC, A Procedure-D escribing Language  
for the Reactive Typewriter", copyright ©  1966 by Rockford  
R esearch, Inc.
I am grateful to C .A .R . Kagan, of Western Electric 
Engineering Research C enter, for his extensive 
(and finally successful) efforts to interest me in 
TRAC Language.In the w ell-thought-out ram ifications of its basic concept,  
the TRAC Language is so  elegant as to constitute a work of  
art. It beautifully fu lfills this rule:
. .  the facilities provided by the language should be  
constructed from  as few basic ideas as p ossible, and  
. . .  these should be general-purpose and Interrelated  
ln the language ln a way which avoided special cases  
wherever p o s sib le ." (Harrison, Data-Structures and  
Program m ing, pub. Scott, Foresm an, p. 251.)
The fundamental idea of TRAC Language, which has  
been worked out in detail with the deepest care, thought and  
consistency, Is this:
ALL IS TEXT.
That Is, all program s and data are stored as strings of  
characters, in the sa m e manner. They are labelled, stored,  
retrieved, and otherw ise treated in the sam e way, as  
strings of text characters.
Data and program s are not kept in binary form , but  
rem ain stored in character form , much the way they w ere  
originally put in. The program s are examined for execution  
as text strings, and they call data In the form of text strings.
This gives rise to certain interesting kinds of  
compatibility.
a) Complete com patibility exists in the command  
structure: the results of one command can becom e another  
command o r can becom e data for another command.
ALMOST NOTHING CREATES AN ERROR CONDITION.
If enough Information Is not supplied to execute a command,  
the command is ignored. If too much information is supplied,  
the extra is ignored.
b) Complete com patibility exists in the data: letters and  
numbers and sp aces may be freely intermixed. Special  
term inal characters (like carriage returns and backspaces)  
are handled just like other characters, giving the program*  
m er com plete control of the arrangement of output on the  
page.
c) Complete compatibility also exists from one computer  
to another, so that work on one computer can be moved to  
another with ease. By the trademark TRAC, M ooers  
guarantees it —  an Innovation.
COMMAND FORMAT
A TRAC command has the following form. The c r o ss-  
hatch or sharp-sign is the way this language identifies a  
command's beginning.
#(NM, arg2, arg3, a r g 4 ,. . )
NM is the name of any TRAC command. It counts as the  
fir st "argum ent," o r piece of information supplied. Arg2,  
arg3, etc. are whatever e lse  the command needs to know to  
be carried out.
We w ill look fir st at exam ples that use the arithm etic  
commands of TRAC Language, not because It is particularly  
good at arithmetic, which it isn't, but because they're the  
sim p lest commands. The arithmetic commands are AD  
(add), SU (subtract, ML (multiply), DV (divide). Each  
arithmetic command takes three arguments, the command  
name and two num bers. Examples:
#(A D ,1,2)
is a command to add the numbers 1 and 2.
#(SU, 4 ,3 )
is a command to subtract the number 3 from the number 4.
#(ML, 632,521)
Is a command to multiply 632 by 521.
#(DV, 100,10)
Is a command to divide 100 by 10.
Now com es the Interesting part.
The way TRAC commands may be combined provides  
the language's extraordinary power. This is based on the  
way that the TRAC p ro cesso r exam ines the program , which  
Is a string of character codes. Watch as we com bine two  
AD instructions:
#(AD, 3, #(AD, 2,5))
The answer is 10. M iraculous!
How can this be?
r  A comma ends an argum ent
in the TRAC language?
A h, that all arguments
could be ended so e a sily . 
—My grandfather.


--- Page 19 ---

The se cret ol combining TRAC commands Is lhat 
every command, when executed, la replaced by its answ er:  
and w hatever may resu lt Is In turn executed.
There Is an exact procedure for this:
SCAN FROM L EFT TO RIGHT
UNTIL A RIGHT PARENTHESIS;
[ — * RE SOLVE THE CONTENTS O F THE
PAIRED COMMAND PARENTHESES
I (execute and replace by the command's result);
| STARTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RESULT,
KEEP SCANNING LEFT-TO-RIGHT 
|______  UNTIL A RIGHT PARENTHESIS. — j
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END, PRINT OUT 
WHAT’S LEFT.
The beauty part Is how It all works so good.
An arithm etic example —  so you get the procedure.
*(AD,2, MAD, 3,4))
___________ first right parenthesis
found.
execute w hat's In lhe 
command parentheses 
*7 & replace
with their answer, leaving;
*(AD, 2,7)
scan to next right parenthesis 
execute & replace1
find no m ore parentheses 
p rin t oul w hat's left.
You might try this yourself on a longer example:
((AD, *(SU, *(AD, 3,4), *(SU, 7,3)), 1)
Here la an Interesting case:
»(AD,1)
T h ere's ro third argument to add to the 1  —  twt that’s 
okay In TRAC Language. 1  It rem ains.
PULLING IN OTHER STUFF
The core m em ory available lo the use Is divided Into 
two a re as, which we may call WORKSPACE and STANDBY.
»(ML,*(AD,7,3),#(SU,ie,9))A
WORKSPACE 
STANDBY ~ |
Strings with Names j
The Standby are a  contains slrlngB of characters with names.
Here could be som e examples:
names strings
[h a r o l d I
\5 4 3 2 I1
[program )-!
(/(PS. HELP: 1  AM TRAPPED IN A LOOP)#(CL, PROGRA mT] 
[GALOSH E S|
|I MUSTN'T FORGET MY GALOSHEsJ
T here Is an Instruction that moves things from the 
Standby are a  to the W orkspace. T his Is the CALL 
Instruction.
»(CL, w hatever)
The CALL Instruction pulls In a copy of the named strin g  
to replace 1 1 , the call Instruction, In the work area. The 
string named In the call Instruction also stays In the Standby 
area until you want to get rid of It. Example:
*(CL, HAROLD)
would be replaced by
54321
Suppose we say In a program  
#(AD,1,»(CL, HAROLD))
Then the resu lt Is:
54322
Now le t's do a program  loop using the CALL. If we 
type In to o u r TRAC processor
«(CL, PROGRAM)
It should type
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP
Indefinitely.
Why Is th is? L et's go through the steps.
We noted thal In our Standby are a  we had a strin g  
named PROGRAM which consisted ol
'(PS, HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP)»(CL, PROGRAM) 
The TRAC p ro ce sso r scans acro ss It to the first right parenthesis. 
»(PS, HELP j J  AM TRAPPED tWA PROGRAM LOOP)*(CL. PROGRAM)
and now executes thllsT ~ ~~ ^
II happens that PS Is the PRINT STRING instruction.
PRINT STRING prints out Its second argument, and forgets 
Ihe rest. But the only argument after PS Isf e l t s  Ojfgh i t s  filrh M lti/j
#  ( P O W f )I T 'S  S U K K liM evM X f
HELP; I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
so It prints that. If It had said
HELP, I AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOP 
ihe PRINT STRING command would only have printed 
HELP
since a comma ends an argum ent In TRAC language.
Now, the PRINT STRING command leaves no result, so 
1116 vaporUed; all we have lefl In the work area Is
»(CL, PROGRAM)
which Is now scanned. But th al's another CALL, and when 
It Is executed by fetching the object called PROGRAM, Its 
replacem ent In (he work area Is
»(PS, HELP; 1  AM TRAPPED IN A PROGRAM LOOPW CL, PROGRAM)
and guess what. We done It again.
(Another example of TRAC Language's consistency: 
suppose 1 1  executes the command
»(CL, EBENEZER)
when there Is no strin g  called EBENEZER. The result Is 
nothing; so that command disappears, leaving no resid u e .)
THE FORM COMMANDS
Let us be a Utile m ore p rec ise . The Standby area 
Is really called by Mooers "forms storage, ” and a string- 
w lth-name lhat is kept there Is called a lorm , One reason 
for this terminology Is thal these strings can consist of 
program s o r arrangem ents that we may want to fit together 
and combine. Thus (hey are "form s".
1. CREATING A FORM
To create a form , you use the DEFINE STRING 
command:
*(DS, form nam e, contents)
The arguments used by DS give a name to (he form  and 
specify wha( you want (o have s(ored in II. Example:
*(DS, ELVIS, 1234)
creates a form named ELVIS with contents 1234.
(e l v IsL
_,^ ‘4l234[
(Note lhal (o gel a program into a form without Its being 
executed on the way requires som e preparation. F o r this, 
"protection" Is used; see end ol article. )
It turns oul lhat DEFINE STRING is the closest TRAC 
Language has to an assignment statem ent (as In BASIC,
LET A - WHATEVER). If you want to use a variable A, 
say, to sto re  the current result of something, In TRAC 
Language you c reate a form named A.
*(DS, A, WHATEVER)
W henever the value of A Is changed, you redefine form A.
2. CALLING A FORM.
As noted already,
#(CL, ELVIS)
will then be replaced by 
1234
But a wonderful extension of this, lhat hasn't been 
mentioned yet, Is
2A. THE IMPLICIT CALL.
You don't even have lo say CL lo call a form . If the 
first argum ent of a command —  thal Is, the first strin g  
Inside the command parentheses —  Is not^ a command known 
to TRAC Language, why, the TRAC p ro cesso r concludes 
lhat the first argument may be the name of a form . So row
1 1  you type
*(AD, * (HAROLD), *  (ELVIS))
V *
It will f irst note, on reaching lhe rlg ht-paren of the 
HAROLD command, that sin ce HAROLD Is 54321, you 
evidently wanted this:
»(AD, 54321, I (ELVIS))
Irescan of resu lt 
and then will do the sam e with ELVIS:
#(AD, 54321,1234) 
so that pretty soon It'll type fo r you 
55555This Implicit call Is the trick that allows people lo create 
th e ir own languages very quickly. In not veiy long, you could 
c reate your own commands —  say ZAPP, MELVIN and som e 
m ore; and while at first ll Is m ore convenient lo type In the 
TRAC form at
*(ZAPP, »(MELVIN))
ll Is very Utile trouble In TRAC Language to create new 
syntaxes of your own Ukc
Z A PP !  MELVIN
thal are Interpreted by (he TRAC processo r as meaning the 
sam e thing.
2B. FILLING IN HOLES.
Another (hlng the CALL command In TRAC Language 
does Is fill In holes thal exls( in form s. Let us rep resent 
a hole as follows:
I  I
Now suppose (here is a TRAC form  with a hole In l(, like 
this.
Cw0RDN « i  it!
Additional arguments in (he call get plugged into holes In 
the fo rm . Examples:
call result
«(CL, WORD) HT
•(CL. WORD.O) HOT 
•(WORD, A) HAT
• (WORD.OO) HOOT
Now, a form  can have a num ber of different holes.
Lc( us denote these by
(1 1  [21 [3| HJ ...
Now suppose wc have a form
[W Q R D > - ^  r ------------------ n
---------- - 7  U)H|2)T13)]
which we might call numerous ways:
call result
• (WORD, W, I, E) WHITE 
*(WORD, , OO, OWL) HOOTOWL
(Note lhal pulling nothing between (wo 
commas made nothing the argument. )
*(WORD, «(W 0 R D ,.0 )S,0 ) HOTSHOT 
Perhaps you can think of oth er examples.
This flll-ln  technique is obviously useful for p ro g ra m ­
ming. If a form  contains a program , Its holes can be made 
to accept varying num bers, form  names, text strin g s, 
oth er p ro g ra m s. Example: Suppose we want to c reate a 
new TRAC command, ADD, lhat adds three num bers instead 
of Just two. F a ir enough:
[addK^ ______
^ S^"*)*IAP»U]i *(A D ,|2 |, jjijl)] and th ere you are.
T his brings up another exam ple ol how nicely TRAC 
Language w orks out. Suppose you have the following In 
lo rm s storage:
T ry  acting lhl6 one oul with pencil and paper. Suppose you 
type In
*(ZOWIE, 5,7)
It happens thal the argum ents 5 and 7 will be passed neatly 
from  ZOWIE to ZIP to ZAP to the final execution of the AD; 
all through the smooth plugging of to les by the implicit call 
and the Magic Scan procedure of the TRAC processo r.This language is marvelously suited lo data base management.
management information system s, interactive query systems, 
and the broad spectrum of "business" programming.
For large-scale scientific number crunching, not so good.
With one exception: "Infinite precision" arithmetic, when 
people want things to hundreds of decimal places.
Chugga chugga.


--- Page 20 ---

\an interpretive language
(each step  carried out directly  
by the processor without conversion  
to another form first);  
an extensible language
(you can add your own commands  
for your own purposes);  
a list-processing language
(for handling complex and amorphous  
forms of data that don't fit in boxes  
and arrays).
It Is one of the few such lan­
guages that fits ln little computers.
3. DRILLING THE HOLES
The holes (called by Mooers segment gaps) are created  
by the SEGMENT STRING Instruction.
#(SS,formname,whateverl, whatever2 ...)
where 'Yormname" Is the form you want to put holes in and  
the whatevers are things you want to replace by holes.
Example: Suppose you have a form
I  INSULTf—  _____________________ _
^ jYOU ARE A CREEP]
You make this more general by means of the SEGMENT  
STRING instruction:
#(SS, INSULT, CREEP)
resulting in
flNSULTk _______________ _
^  YOU ARE A [ ]|
which can be filled in at a more appropriate time.
Fuller example. Suppose we type into the TRAC  
processor the following:
#(DS, THINGY, ONE FOR THE MONEY AND TWO FOR THE SHOW)  
#(SS, THINGY, ONE, TWO, )
^------- note space
We have now created a form THINGY and replaced parts of  
it with segment gaps. Since each of the later arguments of  
SEGMENT STRING specifies a differently numbered gap,  
we will have gaps numbered [lj, [2], and [3j. The gap [1]  
will have replaced the word ONE, the gap [2] will have  
replaced the word TWO, and a lot of gaps numbered [9] will  
have replaced all the spaces ln the form (since the fifth  
argument of SS was a space). The resulting form Is:
[th in g  yJ
([ll[^ F b Ri3iTHE[3]MONEYr3]ANDf3][2][3lFORf3lTHE[3jSTOW^
We can get It to print out Interestingly by typing #(CL,
THINGY, RUN, HIDE) (since after the call, the plugged-ln  
form will still be in the forms storage.) This is printed:
RUNFORTHEMONEYANDHIDEFORTHESHOW
or perhaps, if we use a carriage return for the last  
argument , we can get funny results. The call
# (THINGY, NOT A FIG, THAT, [carriage return]
should result in
NOT A FIG
FOR
THE
MONEY
AND
THAT
FOR
THE
SHOWTEST COMMANDS IN TRAC LANGUAGE
There are test commands In TRAC Language, but like  
everything else they work on strings of characters. Thus  
they may work on numbers or text. Consider the EQ  
command (test if equal):
#(EQ, firstthing, secondthlng, Uso, ifnot)
where "firstthing'’ and "secondthlng" are the strings being  
compared, and Uso and if not are the alternatives. II first­
thing is the sam e as secondthlng, then Uso Is what the  
TRAC processor does, and if not Is forgotten. Example:
#(EQ, 3, #(SU, 5, 2), HOORAY, NUTS)
If it turns out that 3 Is equal to #(SU, 5,2), which It is, then  
all that would be left of the whole string would be
HOORAY
while otherwise the TRAC processor would produce NUTS.
To most computer people this looks completely inslde-  
out, with the thing to do next appearing at the center of the  
test instruction. Others find this feature at-trac-tlve.
DISK OPERATIONS
Now for the juicy disk operations. Storing things on  
disk can occur as an ordinary TRAC command.
#(SB, nam e.form l, form2,form3 . . .  )
creates a place out somewhere on disk with the name you  
give it, and puts in It the forms you've specified. Example:
#(SB, JUNK, TOM, DICK, HARRY)
and they're stored. If you want them later you say
#(FB, JUNK)
and they’re back.
Because you can mix the disk operations In with every*  
thing else so nicely, you can chain programs and changing  
environments with great ease to travel smoothly among  
different system s, circumstances, setups.
Here Is a stupid program that scans all incoming text  
for the word SHAZAM. If the word SHAZAM appears, It  
clears out everything, calls a whole nother disk block, and  
welcomes its new master. Otherwise nothing happens. If  
you have access to a TRAC system (or really want to work  
on it), you may be able to figure It out. (RESTART must  
be In the w orkspace to b eg in .)
/RESTART I  . ________________________________________ .
------------ 1 — |»(DS, TEMP, *(RS))*(SS. TEMP. )*(RPT)|
IrptT^  , ____________________________________________ _
^ ^ |*(EQ. SHAZAM. *(TEST). (#(EVENT)))#(RPT)1
TEMP. (I (RESTART]))!
Ifvfkt F I . _ _ _
1--------- ^ N*(DA)*(FB,MARVEL)i>fPS. WELCOME O MASTER)!
In this example, however, you may have noticed more  
parentheses than you expected. Now for why.
PROTECTION AND ONE-SHOT
The last thing we'll talk about is the other two syntactic  
layouts.
We've already told you about the main syntactic layout  
of TRAC Language, which Is
#( )
It turns out that two more layouts are needed, which we may  
call PROTECTION and ONE-SHOT. Protection is simply
( )
which prevents the execution of anything between the  
parentheses. The TRAC processor strips off these plain  
parentheses and moves on, leaving behind what was in  
them but not having executed it. (But it may come back. )
An obvious use Is to put around a program you're designing:
# (DS, PROG, (#(AD,A, B)))
stripped stripped  
but other uses turn up after you've experimented a little.
The last TRAC command arrangement looks like this
* * ( )
and you can put any command in it, except that Its result  
w ill only be carried one level
l#(CL, ZOWIE, 3,4)
results In (using the forms we defined earlier),In TRAC Language, every command  
is replaced by Us result  
as the program’s execution proceeds.  
This is ingenious, weird and highly effective.

which Is allowed to survive as Is, because the moving finger 
of the TRAC scanner does not re -sca n  the re su lt.
It Is left to the very curious to try to figure out why 
this Is needed.

FAST ANSWERBACK IN TRAC LANGUAGE
TRAC Language can be used for fast answerback to 
sim ple problems. Typing ln long executable TRAC expres­
sions causes the result, If any, to be printed back out 
Immediately.
F or naive users, however, the special advantage is In 
how easily TRAC Language may be used to program  la st 
answerback environments of any kind.
A SERIOUS LANGUAGE; BUT BE WILLING
TO BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE
TRAC Language .Is, besides being an easy language to 
learn, very powerful for text and storage applications.
Conventional computer people don't necessarily believe 
o r like It.
For instance, as a consultant I once had programmed, 
ln TRAC Language, a system  for a certain Intricate form 
of business application. It worked. It ran. Anybody could 
be taught to use It In five minutes. The client was consider- 
Ing expanding It and installing a complete system . They 
asked another consultant.
It couldn't be done In TRAC Language, said the other 
consultant; that's som e kind of a "university" language.
End of project.
HOW TO GET IT
There have been, until recently, certain difficulties 
about getting access to a TRAC processor. Over the years, 
Mooers has worked with his own processors in Cambridge. 
Experim enters here and there have tried their hands at 
program m ing It, with little compatibility In their results. 
Mooers has worked with several large corporations, who said 
said they wanted to try processors to assess the value of the 
the language, but those endeavors brought nothing oul to 
the public.
FINALLY, however, TRAC Language service is pub- 
llcally available, In a fastidiously accurate processor and 
with M ooers' blessing, on Computility™ timesharlng service. 
They run PDP-10 service ln the Boston-to-Washington 
area. (From elsew here you have to pay long d istan ce .)
The charge should run $12 to $15 p er hour In business hours, 
less elsewhen. But this depends to som e extent on what 
your program  does, and Is hence unpredictable. A licensed 
TRAC Language processor may be obtained from Mooers 
for your own favorite PDP-10. Processors for other com­
puters, including m inis, are In the planning stage.
TRAC Language is now nicely documented ln two new 
books by Mooers, a beginner's manual and a standardization 
book (see Bibliography).
Since Mooers operates a sm all business, and must

Some people call it a "scientific" language. 
Some people call it a "mathematical" language.
Some people are most struck by its use for inter­
active systems, so to them it1  s an interactive 
language. But most of us just think of it as THE 
LANGUAGE WITH ALL THE FUNNY SYMBOLS, 
and here they are:
» p u n a c i w t £ |a \ = 0 ; r ° V  M  
" - <Kfi2:=>)v: i _ (  +T-m~0?1 -

PRVCAZ*WYEMQ/XL,SJGKH
Enthusiasts see it as a language of incon­
ceivable power with extraordinary uses, Cynics 
remark that it has all kinds of extraordinary 
powers for inconceivable uses— that is, a weird 
elegance, much of which has no use at a ll, and 
some of which gets in the w ay.
This is probably wrong. APL is a terrific 
and beautiful triumph of the mind, and a very 
useful programming language. It is not for every­
body , but neither is ch ess. It is for bright chil­
dren, mathematicians, and companies who want 
to build interactive systems but feel they should 
stick with IBM.
APL is one of IBM's better products, probably 
because it is principally the creation of one man, 
Kenneth Iverson. It is mainly run on 360 and 
370 computers, though implementations exist 
for the DEC PDP-10 and perhaps other popular 
machines. (Actually iverson designed the lan­
guage at Harvard and programmed it on his own 
initiative after moving to IBM; added to the pro­
duct line by popular demand, it was not a planned 
product and might in fact be a hazard to the firm, 
should it catch on big.)
APL ia a language of array s, with a fascinat­
ing notation. The array system and the notation 
can be explained separately, and bo they will.
Let's just say the language works on things 
modified successively by operators. Their order 
and result is based upon those fiendish chicken 
scratches, Iverson notation.
THAT NIFTY NOTATION
The first thing to understand about APL 
is the fiendishly clever system of notation that 
Iverson has worked out. This system (sometimes 
called Iverson notation) allows extremely complex 
relations and computer-type events to be expressed 
simply, densely and consistently.
(Of course, you can't even type it without 
an IBM  Selectric typewriter and an APL ball.
Note the product-line tie -in .)
The notation is based on operators modifying 
things. Let's use alphabetic symbols for things 
and play with pictures for a minute.
t au/ f t  i f  -
In considering the successive meanings of thiB 
rebus we are proceeding from right to left, aa 
you note, and each new symbol adds meaning. 
This is the general idea.
You will note, in this example, the curious 
arrangement whereby you can have several 
pictures, or operators, in a row. This is one 
of the fun features of the language.TWO-SIDED OPERATORS
In old-fashioned notations, such as ordinary 
arithmetic, we are used to the idea of an operator 
between two things. Like
or in algebra,2 + 2
tXy
These, too, occur in APL; indeed, APL 
can also nest two-sided operators— that is, put 
them one inside the other, like the leaves of 
a cabbage. Old-fashioned notations nest with 
parentheses. But APL nests leftward. It works 
according to a very simple right-to-left ru le .
i x  y  X  2 * 2
the result of this^,
is operated on by 
the next thing and operator, 
yielding another result
which is in turn operated on by 
the next thing and operator,  
yielding final result.
ONE-SIDED OPERATORS
W e are also used to some one-sided operators 
in our previous life. For instance:SAME SYMBOLS WORK BOTH W A YS
Now, one of the fascinating kickers of A PL 
is the fact that most of the symbols have both a 
one-sided meaning and a two-sided meaning; but, 
thank goodness, they can be easily kept straight
Here is a concrete example: the symbol T 
or "ceiling." Used one-sided, the result of 
operator |" applied to something numerical is the 
integer just above the number it is applied to: 
p 7.2 is B . Used two-sided, the result is which­
ever of the numbers it's between i£ larger:
10 f  6 is 10. (There is also , floor, which you 
can surely figure out.)
Now, when you string things out into a long 
APL expression, Iverson's notation determines 
exactly when an operator is one-sided and when 
it is two-sided:
As you go from right to left,
another thing?) OP THING 
another op? I*^ ___ _____________ _
you generally start with a thing on the right. Then 
comes an operator. If the next symbol is another 
thing, then the operator is io be treated as a two- 
sided operator (because it’s between two things).
If the object beyond the first operator is another 
operator, however, that means APL is supposed lo 
stop and carry out the first operator on a one-sided 
basis. Example:
means the negation of 1;
-  ( - 1) 
means negating that.
APL can also nest one-sided operators.
< ^ > A
■rator is
result is worked on by 
fourth operator,  
yielding final result.Conclusion:
It’s two-sided. 
Interpretation:
"subtract B from A."
A + -  B
Bs
*  thing, 
op, 
op—
stop. Conclusion:
The first operator 
is one-sided.  
Interpretation:
"negate B."
Then take next sym bol.
A U tlR J) e x w t e ,  T» HE if* w i t h  r u e  K « w io  V.
Just for kicks, let us make up a notation 
having nothing to do with computers, using these 
Iverson principles:
1) If an operator or symbol ia between two
names of things, carry it out two-sidedly. 
If not, carry it out one-sidedly.
2) Go from right to left.
The best simple example I can think of involves 
file cards on the table (named A, B, C ...)  and 
operators looking like this:
0) 45} 90} 180) 455 90T 1005 
to which we may assign the following meanings:
ONE-SIDED: ROTATION OPERATORS
0} A do nothing to A
451 A rotate A  clockwise 45*
90^ A rotate A clockwise 90°
e tc .
TWO-SIDED: STAPLING OPERATORS 
B 451 A staple A (thing named on the right) 
to B (thing named on the left) 
at a position 45* clockwise from 
middle of B’s centerline.W - T
*
sllp/t (o »  -
And equivalently for other angleB.
Now, using these ru les, and letting our things 
be any file cards that are handy, here are some results:A 0 ) B ’  ^  ___|
a 90} b r- - Ir  j  .
A 90} 90} B [ j l  ~ ]
90} A 90} B
455 A 90) B:cz >o-A
455 A  90} 90) B ^  
B 0) 45) A
A r1
C 45) B 0) 90) A
It's hard to believe, but there you are. This 
notation seems adequate to make a whole lot of 
different stapled p atterns.
Exercise! Use this nutty file card notation 
to program the making of funny p atterns. Practice 
with a friend and Bee if you can communicate 
patterns through these program s, one person 
uncomprehendingly carrying out the other’s 
program and being su rp rise d .
The point of all this has been to show the 
powerful but somewhat startling way that brief 
scribbles in notations of th iB  type can have all sorts 
of resu lts.

Logical array e; 1  0 0 0 1  0 1
(these a rray s of ones snd zeroes are 
called "logical" for a variety of 
reasons; In Ihls caae we could call them 
"logical" simply because they a re  used 
for picking and ehooalng and decid in g .)
Theae th ree num erical types of Information may be 
freely Intermixed In your a rray e. One more type,

the m snuala. but evidently thia type can't be 
mixed In with the others too fre ely . We refer lo 
Ihe alphabetical or "literal" a rra y , as in
The quick brow n fox Jumped over the lazy dog.
Now. p re-w ritten  APL programs can print out 
literal Information, and accept It from a u se r at 
a term inal. w hich Is why APL Is good for the 
creation of system s for naive ueers (see "Good-Guy 
System s.” p . i j).
Literal vectors may be picked a p a rt. 
rearranged and assembled by all the reg u la r APL 
operators. T h at's how we twiddle our tent.

IVERSON'S TAFFY-PULL
A num ber of basic APL operators help you 
atretch. aquleh and pull apart your array a. 
Consider the lowly comma (called "rav el," which 
means the aame as "u n rav el").
•  A forgel A 's old dim ensions, 
make It one-dlm enalonal.
A .B  make A and B one long 
one-dimensional a rray .
Here la how we make things appear and disap p ear. 
("C om pression.")
A/B A must be a one-dlmenalonal 
array  of ones and te ro e s .
T he resu lt la those elem ents 
of B selected by the o n e s. 
Example:
1  0 1 / c a 1  
results In 
c t
The opposite slash  has the opposite effect. 
Inserting ex tra null elements where there 
are zaroea:
1  1  0 l \ 3  5 B  
results in
3 5 0 9
H ere's another selector. This operator 
takes the first o r last few of A. depending on size 
and sign of B:
Bt A
and B ^  A Is the opposite.
If you wanl to know Ihe relative positions of 
numbers of different sizes In s one-dim ensional 
a rray .
^  (name of array)
will tell y o u . It gives you the positions. In ord er 
of size, of the num bers. And 4  does It for 
descending o r d e r .
T hese a re  Just sam ples. The lin g o e s  onMHere is an APL p rogram  thal types out 
backw ards what you type In . First look at the 
program , then the explanation below.
V  REV

Explanation. The dow n-polnllng triangles 
("dels") symbolize the beg in n in g  and end of a 
progrsm . which In this caae we have called REV. 
On Line 1. the "Quote-Quad" symbol (on the rig h t) 
causes the APL processor to wall for alphabetical 
input. Presumably Ihe u se r will type something. 
The u se r's line of Input Is stuffed Into thing or 
array  1. The u s e r's  c arriag e  retu rn  tells the APL 
processor he haa finished, so It continues in the 
program . On Ihe second lin e . APL lakes a rray  1  
and doea a one-sided £  to II. which happens to 
mean turning il aro u n d . Left-arrow  into Ihe 
quote-quad symbol means p rin t II out.
Because of APL'a com pactness, indeed. Ihls 
magnificent program  csn ell go on one line:
^  REV
[ ■ ]
V
First the input goes into I. then Ihe processor does 
s 1  (reversal) and puts it oul.
And here Is o u r old f rie n d . the fortune-cookie
1 0  0  • - 'HELP. I AM CAUGHT IN A LOOP1
[ i ]  ->  1
On line 1  the program  prin ts out w halevcr's In 
quotes. And line 2 causes It to go back and do 
line 1  again. Forever.
frte  m n V L
II should be mentioned at this point that 
branching tests a re  conducted in APL program s 
by specifying conditions w hich a re  eilhcr true or 
false, and APL's answ er is 1  if iru e . 0 if false.
(This is snolher thing these logical a rray s are for.)
Example:
3>2
T his operation lesves the num ber 1. because 3  
is greater than 2. So you could branch on a test 
with something like
which brsnches to line 7 in the program  if A Is 
greater than B. and Is ignored (as an unexeculable 
branch to line zero) if B la g reater than A.
THE APL ENVIRONMENT
Aside from the APL language itself, to 
program in APL you must learn a lot of "system" 
commands, alphabetical commands by which lo tell 
the APL processor w hat y ou w ant to do ln general
— whal to store, what lo b rin g  forth from atorage. 
and so on.
O rdinarily you have a w orkspace, a collec­
tion of program s and data w hich you may summon 
by name. When il comes-- that is . when the com­
puter haa fetched thia material and announced on 
your terminal lhat It ia re a d y -- you can ru n  the 
programs and use the data ln your w orkspsce.
You can also have passw ords for your different 
w orkspacea, so others at other term inals cannot 
tamper wilh your stuff.
Thia is not the piece to go into the system 
commands. If yo u 're serio u s, you can learn them 
from the book or th e  APL salesm an.
T here are m any. many different erro r 
mesaages that the APL processo r c sn  send you. 
depending on the circum stances. It Is poaslble
lo make m any, many m istakes in APL. and 
there are e rro r messages for all of Ihem. All 
of them, that Is, lhat look to the computer like 
e rro rs; If you do something p erm issible that's 
not what you intended, the com puier will not 
tell y o u .
But It is a term inal la n g u ag e . designed to 
help people muddle th ro u g h .Smvfoe M I S  lO o M b ttfU t
C H o ie e j o f  m t t t s
Iv erso n 's notation is built around the 
curious principle of having the same symbols mean 
two things depending on context. (Goodness 
knows he u ses enough different symbols; doubling 
up si least means he doesn’t need any more.) It 
tu rn s out that ihia notation representsTconsisieni 
se ries of operations in astounding combinations.
The overall APL language, really, la the 
c arry in g  through of this notation to create an Im ­
mensely powerful programming language. The 
impetus obviously came from the desire lo make 
v a rious intricate mathematical operations easy to 
command. The resu lt, however, le a programming 
language with great power for simpler tasks as well.
Now. the consequences of ihls overall Idea 
w ere nol determ ined by God. They were worked 
oul by Iv eraon. v e ry  thoughtfully, so as lo come 
oul sym m etrical-looklng and easy lo remember.
What we see is the clever exploitation of apparent 
b ut Inexact sym m elrles In the Ideas. Often APL'a 
one-sided and tw o-sided p airs of operators are 
more su ggestively similar than really the same 
Ihing.
When Iverson ssslgn6 one-alded and two- 
sided meanings to a symbol, often the two meanings 
may look natu ral only because Iverson Is such sn 
a rtist. Exsmple:
tw o-sided one-sided
AX B a B
A times B the sign of B
This makes se n s e . To argue thal It ia inherent in 
"taking away half the idea of multiplication." 
how ever, is dubious.
Some symm etries Iverson hss managed to 
come up with a re  truly rem arkable. The a rro w , 
for Instance. T he left arrow:
Aaaignment statement; B (which 
may have been computed du rin g  
Ihe leftward scan) ia assigned 
the name of A:
and Ihe rlghl arrow :
The Jump statement, w here B 
(which may have been com­
puted d urin g  the leftward scan ) 
Is a statement number: the 
program now goes and executes 
that line.
This symmetry Is mystically in teresting becau se 
the asaignmenl and Jump statements are so basic 
to programming -
Or consider this:
□ < - x
p rint X.
x«-n
-> e/a
(one way of w ritin g . "Jump lo A if B Is tru e " )
Is a special case of the ''com pression" o p e ra to r. 
(Berry 360 p rim e r. 72 and 165.) T his is v e ry  
h ard to u n d erstan d , although it seems c lea r w h ile 
you're reading il.
On Ihe other h an d , there is ev ery  indication 
thal APL la ao deep yo u  keep finding new tru th s 
in il . (Like the above p a ra g ra p h .) The whole 
thing is Just unbelievable. Hooray for all th at.
APL FOR USER-LEVEL SYSTEMS
(See "Good-Guy Syatem e." p . )
Because APL can solicit text Input from a user and analyze It. 
the language ia powerful for Ihe creation of u ser-lev el environm ents 
and system s-- with the d rsw b ac k , univ ersal to all IBM term inals, 
that inpul linea must end with specific c h aracters. In other w ords,
It can't be aa fully Interactive a s computer languages that uae ASCII 
term inals.
Needless to s a y . Ihe mathematical elegance and pow er of the 
system Is completely unnecessary  for most u ser-level system s. But 
It's nice to know it's  th ere.
APL Is probably best for system s with well-defined and seg­
regated fileB-* " array -ty p e problem s," like payroll, accounts and 
so o n. Il Is not suited for much la rg e r amorphous and evolutionary 
stuff, the way list languages like TRAC a re . Don't use APL If 
y o u 're  going 10 store large evolving texts or huge brokerage data 
b ases, like whal tankera are free in the M editerranean.
T he quickest payoR may lie in using APL to replace b usiness 
forms sn d  haaten the flow of Information through a company. A 
salesman on the road with an APL term inal. for Instance. can at once 
enter his o rd ers in the computer from the customer's office, checking 
inventory d irec tly . If the program  is up ■

IBM doesn't sell APL services. T heir time* 
sharing APL is available. however. from various 
suppliers. Of course, lhat meana you probably 
have to have an IBM-type term inal. unless you find 
a service lhat offers APL to Ihe other hind-- an 
addition which seems to be becoming fashionable.
Usual charge la about ten bucke an hour

on whai you're ckilng. It can easily run over $15 
an h our, though, and more for heavy crunching 
or printout. eo watch It.

tell you where you can renl one). patiently show 
you how to sign o n . leach you the language (or 
maybe an hour if h e's a nice guy. snd proffer 
ihe contract.
— ^APL services are probably safer lo sign 
onto. In lerme of risked expenses. than moat other 
tim e-sharing systems. (Though of course ell 
tim e-sharing Involves financial risk .) Because 
the system is restricted only and exactly to APL. 
you're not paying for capabilities you won't be 
using, or for massive disk storage (which you're 
not allowed In moel APL aervlces anyway). or 
for acres of core memory you mlghl be templed 
to fill.
— » ]n other worda. APL is a comparatively 
straight proposition, snd highly recommended if 
you have a lol of tnalh o r statistics you'd like lo do 
on a fairly small number of esses. Also good for 
a varlely of other thlnga. though. Including fun.

PROGRAMS IN APL
But lhe-larger function of APL Is lo create 
programs that ean be etored. named and carried 
oul at a later lime.
For th is. APL allows you to define programs. 
a line al a time. The programs remain stored In the 
system ss long sb you wanl. Using the "Del” 
operator ( V  ) •  you tell the system thal you wanl lo 
put In a program. Del cauaes the terminal to help 
you along In various w ays.
A nice feeture is lhal you can lock your APL 
programs, lhat Is, make them Inaccessible and 
unreadable by olhere. whether Ihey are 
programmers or not. In thla case you define a 
program starting wilh ihe mystical sign del-tllde 
(l^i) Instead of del ( V )  •  and Invoke Ihe names 
of dark spirits.Different vendors offer interesting vsrlslions 
on IBM's baalc A P L \360 package, as noted below.  
In other words. they\om pele with each olher in 
part by adding features lo the baalc APL\380 pro­
gram, vying for your buslnees. Each of Ihe ven­
dors listed also offers various programs In APL 
you can use interactively al an IBM-type terminal, 
In many cases using an ordinary lypeball and not 
seeing the funny character!; though how clear and 
easy iheBe programs are will vary.
And remember. of course, that you can do 
your own thing. or have olhers do II for yo u ,  
using APL.
APL Is also available on the PDP-10. and 
presumably other non-IBM big machines.
THE VENDORS
Scientific Time-Sharing Corporation (7316 Wiscon­
sin A ve.. Belheada MD 20014) calls He 
version APL'PLUS. They'll send you a 
nice pocket card summarizing the commends.
APL*PLUS offers over twentyflve 
concentrators around the country, per­
mitting local-call services In such metro­
politan centers aa Kalamazoo and Rochester. 
(Firms with offices In both cities. please 
note.)
They also have en "AUTOSTART" 
feature which permlis Ihs chaining of pro­
grams Into grand complexes, so you don't 
have lo call them all Individually.
APL*PLUS charges the following for 
storage, if you can dig It: $10 PER M ILLION 
BYTE-DAYS. (A byte Is usually one 
character.) The census Is probably taken 
once a d ay .
This firm also services ASCII ter­
minals. which some people will consider 
to be a big help. Thai means you can have 
Interaclive uaera of APL programs at ASCII 
terminals, and that you ean also program 
from (he few APL terminelB lhat aren't of 
the IBM  type.
APL, like BASIC, can be classed aa an "algebraic" 
language-- but ihle one la bulll to pleeee 
real mathematicians, wilh high-level stuff 
only they know about, like Inner and Outer 
Products.
Paradoxically, Ihls makea APL terrific for teaching 
theae deeper mathematical concepts, helping 
you see the consequences of operadons and 
tha underlying structure of mathematical 
thlnga. Matrla alaebra. for Instance, can be 
vlauallced a lol better by working up to It 
with leaser concepta (like vectors and 
Inner products) enacted on an APL terminal.
It would be really swell If eomeone would put to­
gether a tour-guide book of higher mathem­
atics at the gTade/hlghschool level for people 
with access to APL.
Interestingly. Alfred Bork (U. ofCal. at Irvine) 
is tsklng a similar approach to teaching 
p h ysics, using APL aa a fundamental 
language In his physics courses.
SNEAKY REPEATER STATEMENT IN APL?
One of the APL operators. "lota" ( i ) .

on. This until the laat one la reached.

service. Including text syetems and verlous 
kinds of file hendllng, under lhe name 
TOTAL/APL.

Time Sharing Reaourcee. Inc. have added 
ia an EXECUTE command, which allows an 
APL siring entered al the keyboard In 
uaar on-line mode to be executed as alraight 
APL. Thla Ib heavy.
Perhaps the most vereatile-aoundlng APL service 
right now is offered b y . of all people. a 
subsidiary of the American Can Company.  
American Information Services (American 
Lane. Greenwich CT 06630) calls Iheir 
version VIRTUAL APL. meaning lhat It can 
run In "virtual memory"-- a popular 
mienomer for virtually unlimited memory—  
and consequently lhe programmer Is hardly 
subject to spaee limitations at a ll. Moreover, 
files on the A1S system are compatible with 
other IBM  languages, so you can use APL lo 
iry things oul quickly and then convert lo 
Fortran, Cobol or whatever. (Or. conversely, 
a company may go from those olher languages 
to APL wllhoul changing Ihe way their files 
are stored on this serv ice.) APL may Indeed 
Intermit with these other languages, how 
is unclear.
And the prices look especially good: 
$8.75 an hour connect. f IS a monlh minimum 
(actually their minimum disk space rental 
- -  1  IBM cylinder—  so for lhat amount you 
get a lot of storage). But remember there 
are etill core chargee, and $1 per thouaand

Instead of under "Terminals" for no apeclal reason:
Tektronix offers one of ils greenle graphics 
terminals (Bee nip side) tor APL (the model 4013). 
This permits APL to draw pictures for you. 1 1  
seems lo be an ASCII-type u n il.
Computer Devices. Inc. supposedly makes an

O ne of the commonest and most destructive 
rov th . about computers Is the Idea that they "only 
" e l  with n u m b ers." This Is TOTALLY FALSE.
Not only Is it a ghastly m isunderstanding, but It is 
often an Intentional m isrepresentation, and as such, 
not only is It s m isrepresentation but It Is s dsmned 
lie. and anyone who telle il Is using "mathematics" 
as s wet noodle to beat the resd e r w ith.
Com puters deal with symbols snd p attern s.
Com puters deal with symbols of any Kind-* 
letters, musical notes. Chinese ideogram s, arro w s. 
lee cream  flavors, and of course num bers. (Num­
bers come also In various flavors, simple end 
b aroque. See choeolate b o a, p. 2.1.
Data stru ctu re means any symbols sn d  pat­
terns Bet u p  for use In a computer. It means what 
things a re  being taken into account b y a com puter 
program , and how these things are set u p — what 
symbols and arrangements a re  used to rep resen t 
them.
The problem , obviously . Is Representing 
The Information You Want Just The Way You Want ft. 
In all Us tru e  complexities.
(This Is often forbiddingly stated a s "making 
a mathematical model"*- but th at's usually in lite 
rhetorical, far-fetched and sstrsl sen se in which 
all relations a re  "mathematical” and le tte rs of Ihe 
alphabet are considered lo be s special distorted 
kind of n um ber.)
Now it happens that there are many kinds of 
data s tru c tu re , and they are Interchangeable in 
intricate ways.
The same dsta. with all its relationships snd 
in tricacies, csn be sel up in a vast variety  of a r ­
rangem ents and atyles which are inside-out and 
upside-dow n versions of esch other. The same 
thing (say . the serial num ber. 24965, of an auto­
mobile) may be represented in one d sta stru ctu re 
by a set of symbols (such as Ihe decimal digits
2. 4, 9. 6. S  in Ihst o rd er), snd in an other dsla 
stru ctu re by the position of something else (such 
as the 24965th name in a iisl of automobile ow ners 
reg istered  with Ihe m anufacturer).
Fu rth erm o re. many different forms of data 
may be combined o r twisted together in the same 
overall se tu p .
The dsta structure chosen goes a long way 
in im posing techniques and styles of operation on 
Uie program .
On the o th e r hand, the computer language 
you use has a considerable efTect upon the data 
stru c tu re s you may choose. Languages tend to 
Impose sty les of handling Information. T he deci­
sion to program  a given problem in a specific lan­
guage . such as BASIC or COBOL o r APL o r TRAC 
L anguage. either locks you into specific typ es of 
dsta stru c tu re , or eneris considerable p re ssu re  lo 
do it s certain  w ay . In most casea you c an 't set It 
up Just any way you want, but have to adjuat to 
Ihe language you are usin g -- although today 's 
languages tend to allow more and more ty p e s of

FANCY STRUCTURES
Many forms of a dvanced program m ing are 
based on Ihe idea that th in g s don’t have lo be stored 
next lo each o th e r, o r In any p articu lar o rd er.
If things a re n 't nem  to each o lh e r. we need 
another w ay Ihe  program  ca n tell how they belong 
together.
A p o inter. th e n -- sometim es called a llnk-- 
1s s piece of data that telle w here another piece of 
data Is, In some form of memory . Pointers often 
connect pieces of dala.
Pointer
i f' piece] 
)ata |
A pointer can be an address in core memory; il 
can be an address on disk (dlsk p o in ler)i It can 
point to a whole strin g  e t  d a ta . such s s  a  nam e. 
when there is no way of know ing in advsnce how 
long ihe strin g  may be (slrin g p o ln ter) .
A series of pieces of d ata w hich point to each 
other in s continuing sequence is called s threaded
For this reason Ihe handling of data held together 
by p o inters-- even though it may make all sorts of 
different p slte rn s-' is called list p ro cessin g . (The 
(The term "list processing” might seem to go a- 
gainsl common sen se, as it might suggest something 
like. say. a laundry list, which is structured in a 
very simple blocklike form. But th at's whal we 
calf it.)
Prominent list-processing languages include 
SNOBOLi I 6 and LISP (see p - 3 1 >  •  T here is srgu- 
menl as to whether TRAC Language ia a list-proc­
essing language.
Here are some Interesting stru ctu res that 
programmers create by list processing:
RINGS (or cycles) . T hese a re  arrangements 
of pointers that go around in a circle to their first 
item again.FAST-CHANCING DATA
One of the u ses of such slruclures is in 
strange types of program s where Ihe Interconnec­
tions of information a re  changing quickly and 
u n p red ictab ly . Such operations happen fast In 
core memory. In th is kind of programming (for 
w hich languages like LISP. SNOBOL and TRAC 
Language are especially convenient), the pointers 
a re  changed back and forth In core memory, every 
which w ay , all the lim e. Presumably according to 
Ihe p rogram m er's fiendish master plan-- if he's 
gotten the bugs o u t. (See Debugging, p . 3 0 ,)
FANCY FILES
But these stru c tu re s are not restricted to 
data in core m em ory. Complex and changeable 
files can be kept on disk  in various ways by the 
same kind of thread in g  (called "chaining" on mass 
storage).
CHAINED FILE ON DISK
A nother way of h an dling changeable files is 
through s ao-caJJed directo ry  block, which keeps 
trsck  of w here all the olh er blocks are stored.
ifo tt
□  I M . J f . k
But these tech n iq u es, you see. may be used 
In both fast and slow op eratio n s, and for any pur* 
p o se. so trying lo categorize them tends not to be 
helpful. (Note also that ihese techniques work 
w hether yo u 're d ealing with b its, o r characters, 
o r any olher form of d a ta .)
Note: By decent standards Of English, 
the word dala should be plural, datum s in ­
g ular. Bul ihe matter is too far gone: data 
is now utterly sin g u lar, like "corn” and 
"information." a g ranular collective which 
may be scooped, poured o r counted.
But I draw Ihe line al media. Media 
are many, "media" is plural!
"Computers put e v ery th in g  into p igeonholes.''
Wrong. People put things into p igeon­
holes. And desig n ers of computer program s 
can set up lousy pigeonholes. If you let 'em. 
More sophisticated program m ing can often 
avoid pigeonholes e n tirely .
TREES. T hese are stru c tu re s lhat fan o u t. 
(There are no rings in a tree s tru c tu re , technically 
speak in g .)
P lain ly . th e n , It is these overall stru c tu re s 
thal we really care about; but to u nderstand o ver­
all stru c tu re s, we need an Idea of all the different 
forms of d ata that may be put in them .
VARIABLES AND ARRAYS
T he earlieat data stru ctu res in com p u ters, 
and still th e  pred o m in a tin g  onea, e r e  v ariables and 
a rra y s . (We met them earlier u nder BASIC, see 
{P-lfc-17' and APL, see q . )
A v a riab le is a space o r location in core 
memory. (For convenience, most program m ing 
languages allow the program m er to call a v ariable 
by a name, so that he doesn't have to keep track 
of ita num erical a d d re as.)/ \

GRAPH STRUCTURES (sometimes called 
p lex es) . Here the w ord "g rap h ” is not used in the 
o rdinary w ay, to mean a diagrammatic sort of p ic­
tu re , but to mean any stru c tu re  of connected 
points. Rings and trees are special cases of graph 
stru ctu res.
G raph stru c tu re s 
can go any w hich w ay.People who want to feel With It 
occasionally use the term "bU" for 
any old chunk of information, like a 
name o r ad d re as. T his is Wrong.
A Bit is the sm allest pieee of binary 
Information, an Item lhat can be one 
of two thingB, like heads o r tails,
X o r O, one o r  zero ; a nd  all olher 
information can b e packed into a 
countable num ber of b its . (How many 
may depend on the data stru ctu re 
c h o sen .)
As a handy ru le of thumb: 
every letter of the alphabet o r punc­
tuation mark la eight bits (aee ASCII 
box); for heavy storage of everyday 
decimal n u m b ers, every numerical 
digit can be fu rth er packed down (to 
four bits in BCD code).

A  CONCRETE EXAMPLE. Suppose we want 
to rep rese n t the genealogy o f (he m onarchs of Eng*
England, bo far as Is k n o w n . In a computer data 
S tru ctu re. NOTE THAT A DATA STRUCTURE IS 
DIFFERENT FROM A PROGRAM: If sev eral program - 
mere agree beforehand on a data stru c tu re . then 
(hey can go separate w ays and each can w rite a 
program  (o do something different with it— If they 
have really agreed on a complete an d  exact layout, 
which they may only think they've done.
F irst we consider the subject m atter. Gen­
ealogy Is conceptually sim ple to u s , but as data 
is nol as triv ial as It might seem at f ir s t. Every 
perso n  has two p arents and a specific date of b ir th .
Each pair of parents can have more than one child, 
and Individual parents can at different times ahare 
parenthood with different other Individuals.
Presum ably we w ould like a data structure 
thal allows a program  to flnd out who was a given 
p e rso n 's p a re n t, who w ere a given p erson'a chil­
d re n , what broth ers and sisters each person had, 
and sim ilar m atters (so far a s is known by h istor­
ians-- another difficulty).
Note that Juat because It ia simple to put this 
Information in a wall c h a r t, lhat does not mean ll 
la simple to figure out an adequate data stru c tu re .
Note too. thal any aspect of the data which 
Is left out cannot then be handled by Ihe p rogram .
W hat's not there is nol th ere.
T he easy way oul Is to use a language like, 
sa y , TRAC Language, and use Its basic units (In 
this c ase , "forma1 1 ) lo make up a data stru ctu re 
whose individual sections would show parentage, 
d a lea , b ro th ers and sla te rs and so o n .
T he b rav e r approach ie to try  to aet it up 
for something like FORTRAN or BASIC, languages 
which trea t core memory more like a num erically- 
a d dressed array  o r b lo c k , as doee rock-bottom 
machine language.
Let ue assume that we have decided to use 
an a rray -ty p e  data stru c tu re , for Instance to go 
with a program  In the BASIC language on a 16- 
blt m inicom puter. We do not have much room 
in core m emory, so for each person In our data 
stru ctu re we are going lo have to store a sepa­
rate reco rd  on a disk  m emory, and call It into 
core memory as req u ired .
After much head -scratch in g , we might 
come up with something like the following. It 
la not a v ery good dala stru c tu re . It la not a 
v ery good dala stru ctu re on purpoae.
It u se s a block of 28 w ords, or 448 b its, 
p er individual, not counling the length of his 
name, which Is an additional 6 bits p er c h ar­
acter o r space. However, this In Itself Is n ei­
th e r good nor bad. It's more lhan you might 
expect, but less than you might need.
(Incidentally, out of concern for storage 
sp ace, some data flelda sre  packed more than 
one lo e 16-blt computer w ord. T his Is sco rn ­
fully called bit-fiddling by computerfolk who 
w ork on big machlnea and don't have to w orry

on u ttW  evew termsHera are some aaeumptions 1  have embodied 
In thia dala stru c tu re . T hat is , I had them In 
m ind. (The p arts you d id n 't have In mind are 
what get you la te r.)
Parents and children of monarcha 
a re included, as well as 
m onarcha.
All m onarchs have a separate mon­
arch num ber.
No m onarch reigned more than 
tw ice. (?)
No m onarch o r p arent of a monarch 
had more than flve children 
of one sex. (Note the danger 
of these assum ptions.)
We are not interested In gran d ch il­
d ren  of monarchs u nless they 
are also monarcha. o r alblings. 
o r p aren ts of m onarcha.
The information about the different 
people can be Input in any 
o rd er, as the years of reign 
can b e stepped through by a 
p rogram  lo And the o rd e r of 
reig n .
If thia seems like too much b o ther, thal is 
In a way the point. Data structures must be 
thought o u t. Since com pulers have no Intrinsic 
way of o perating o r of handling data (though 
p a rticu lar languages will restrict you in p artic­
ular w ay s), you will have to w ork all Ihls out, 
and a carelessly  chosen dala stru c tu re  will leave 
something o ut. o r fail to distinguish among im­
portant differences, o r otherw ise have Its revenge.
(For instance, if you haven't noticed yel: 
we left out legitim acy. For many p u rposes we 
want lo know which kin g s were b a stard s.)
(Self-teBl: is flve bits long enough to ex ­
p ress Ihe greatest num ber of months any English 
monarch reigned? -- see "Binary P a ttern s." Or 
do we have to fix this data stru ctu re on that 
score also?)
To give you a sen se of the sort of program  
this dala stru ctu re allows:
A program  lo ascertain how many kings 
were the sons of kin g s would look al each entry 
that had a monarch n u m b er, teat w hether the 
monarch was male, and if male, would look al 
the male paren t's serial num ber. Then It would 
look up lhat parent'B e n try , and see w hether il 
in tu rn  had a m onarch num ber, and if so . add 
one lo the count it was making. T hen il would 
go back to the enlry il had been looking al. 
and step on to the one after that.
T h is is actually a pretty lousy dala stru c ­
tu re. T he clum siness of this approach to such 
data-- and you are welcome to think of a better 
one-- show s some of Ihe difficulties of handling 
complex dala about the real w orld. Things like 
lengths of names and num bers of relatives p ro ­
duce great ir re g u la ritie s, but make these kinds 
of data no less w orth of our attention.
We could add lotB of things to o u r dala 
stru ctu re (and so make il more unw ieldy). For 
Instance, we might want to mark each serial 
num ber specially if it referred to someone who 
was Ihe offspring of a monarch. We could sim­
ply sel a particu lar bit to 1  in the serial number 
for them (called a flag o r lag) . W e could also flag 
dales and genealogies lhal are regarded as u n ­
c ertain. T here is no limit lo the exactness and 
complexilv with which information may be rep ­
resented , But doing ll rlghl can. as alw ays, 
be troublesome.
A lot of com puter people wanl to avoid 
dealing with complex data; perhaps you can be­
gin to see w h y . out we must deal with lhe 
tru e complexities of information; therefore lan­
guages and systems lhal allow complex informa­
tion stru ctu res must become belter-know n and 
easier lo u s e .
THE FRONTIER: COMPLEX FILE STRUCTURE
T he arrangem ents of whole flies— groups 
of reco rd s o r olher info ch u n k s-- sre  up to the 
program m er. The stru c tu re  of flleB Is called, 
nol su rp risin g ly , file stru c tu re , and It Is up lo 
the program m er to decide how hla files should 
be arran g e d .
H abits die h a rd . The notion of sequence-- 
even false, imposed sequence— Is deep In Ihe 
racial unconscious of computer people. An in te r­
e sting concrete term show s this nicely. Because 
com puter people often think any file should have 
a basic sequence, (hey use Ihe term inverted 
file for a file that h as been changed from its 
basic sequence (o an other sequence. But increas­
in g ly , all the sequences are falae and artificial.  
Where now are Inverted flies? All fllea sre  In­
v erted If th ey 're an y thing.
F o rtu n ately , the final frontier of data 
stru c tu re  la now Increasingly recognized as the 
control of complex storage of flies on disk  mem­
ory . T he latest fancy term for this Is data base 
syalem . meaning planned-out overall storage lhal 
you can send y o u r program s to like m essengers.
T he facl that IBM now has moved into this 
a re a  (with Its Intricate "access methods" and all 
th e ir Initiala) means complex storage control has 
filially a rriv e d , although the pioneering w ork 
waa done by Bachman at GE some year6 ago 
(aee biblio g rap h y ). T ill the last few y eara, 
e x ternal sto rag e, with pointers and ev erything, 
has not been conveniently u nder the program m er's 
control except in c ru d e  w ays. Finally we are 
seeing system s b eg inning lo gel around that 
automatically handle complex file stru c tu re s in 
v ersatile ways that program m era can use more 
easily." T h era is a growing feeling that data p rocessing people 
would benefit if they w ere to accept a radically new 
point of view , one that would liberate Ihe application 
p rogram m er's thinking from the centralism  of core 
storage and allow him the freedom lo act a s a naviga­
to r w ithin a database. Thla reorlentallon will 
cause as much anguish among program m ers a6 the 
heliocentric theory did among ancient astronom ers and 
theolo g ian s.”

Dala Is p u n c h ed  Into card s according to 
some plan associated with the p rogram .MAGNETIC STORAGE

calls for- But each aeP8rale piece o r section 
o f Inform ation-- each bu n ch  o f consecutive 
c h aracters thal tog eth er have a specific meaning 
-- are called a field .
A field can be a nam e, a n u m b er, an

ITM 
S o n e n n t s  n
Data usually has to be m arshalled Into 
row s, o r even regiments and battalions, before 
It can go Into a computer.
(Some people Just get th eir data into a 
com puter by sitting at a term inal snd typing 
it In. p erh ap s answering questions typed to them 
by a fro n t-en d  p rogram . But th ey 're the lucky 
o n es. Most of us have lo gel the data sel up 
on some Kind of holding surface before il gets 
fed In. T h at's an Input medium. )
DATA MEDIA
A dala medium ("medium" Is th e sin g u lar 
of "media") Is anything thal holds Ihe m arks of 
data outside Ihe core memory of a com puier.
Thus punched cards and punched p a p er lape 
may be u sed aa Input m edia. used for putting 
Information Into a computer. (Each medium 
needs a corresponding Input or output d e v ice,  
to w hisk acro ss the aurface and Iranalale its 
marks or holes Into the corresponding electronic 
p u lse s.)
T h ere are three types of data media;
Input, output and storage media. An input 
medium c arries the dala In. An output medium 
receives the results of a program; for instance, 
a sheet of paper coining out of a  p rin tin g  device 
Is an output medium, as Is a punched card  o r 
punched p ap er tape.
Storage media are output media that may 
be u se d  as input media later on. T hus punched 
card s and punched paper lape can be storage 
media. Bul Ihe better storage media u se mag­
netic recording (which Is faster and less b ulky), 
like magnetic tape and d isk s, or Just plain 
"disks" as we generally call them. (See fuller 
list of mag media under "Peripherals." p .  5 7  ■)
T he u nits and arrangem ents of dala used 
for in p u t. output and storage are In principle 
not n e ce ssarily  ihe true ones of the dala structure 
used b y  the p rogram . The blocks and records 
of sto ra g e , for instance, may have irreg u la r 
data w ith poinlere sitting in them. (Unfortun­
ately th ere is some carryover, in that program ­
mers a re  tempted to use dsta stru ctu res which 
are easy lo slore and run in and o u t. rath er 
than h andling the true complexities of the sub­
ject. T h is is always a temptation.)
Let us consider the units and arrangem ents 
□ f  data u sed lor Input and output and storage. 
These a re , respectively, fields, reco rd s, flies 
and blocks.
THE PUNCH CARD
Let's begin wilh a fun example; that 
hoary old medium for input and ou tp u t, the 
punched (or "punch") card . The punch card 
will show us what a field is.
T he punch card Is generally believed lo 
have b e en  Invented by Herman Hollerith (al­
though the au th o r's In-laws had bitter recollec­
tions io the co n trary). It was first u sed on a 
broad scale to count up the census of I960, and 
later becam e an early cornerstone of IBM, but 
that’s ano th er story.
T h e punches on a card represent s row 
of Information (such aa a row of typed le tte rs), 
this la not obvious because the card la a r e c ­
tangle ra th e r lhan a line. However, th e length 
of ihe card  1b actually divided into eighty posl 
bona, each of which may hold one n u m ber, 
alphabetic character or punctuation m ark.
These positions are actually narrow  colum ns, 
eighty o f them, with different positions In which 
holes may be punched. One hole In a column 
rep resen ts a numeral; which position in  the 
column specifies what num ber. Two holes In 
a column generally mean a letter of the alphabet, 
three holes in  a column mean a punctuation 
mark.

Sometimes, in dism al system s we encoun­
ter d ay-to-day— like fo r university registration
— a punch card will have a p e rso n 's name in 
the first few colum ns, o r w orse, s personal 
serial n um ber. O ther Information continues 
from th ere. T hese may o r may not be recog­
nizable. either from rea d in g  the holes by eye, 
or from designations p re-p rin ted  on the card.
ASCII code. You can figure out from 
the table the bll p attern for any letter, or 
w hal any given combination of seven bits
Example. Find ih e capital letter G 
In the table. For the first th ree bits of the 
code, look st the top of the column: 100. 
For the next four, look sidew ays lo the 
left; 0111. So G Is; IOOOIU.
(An eighth bit Is uBed as a check on 
the num ber of ones In th e code: this is 
called the parity b it, an d  eith er rounds to 
an even num ber of b its (even parity) o r an 
odd number of bits (odd p a rity ) . T h u s If 
a code comes through to th e  com puter with 
a wrong num ber of o nes, th e computer 
can take remedial a ctio n .)
Those funny m ulU letter codes are for 
controlling term inals and like that.

T ransceiver System s, in c.T he seme principle of fields applies in 
oth er data media, especially magnetic tape and 
d is k . We may extend the notion of a field to 
explain reco rd s and files.
A field, generally speaking, Is a section 
of positions on some medium reserved for one 
particu lar piece of information, or lha data In ||,
A record is a bunch of fields stored on 
some medium w hich have some organized use. 
(For Instance, the accounting Information held 
by an electric utility company about a particular 
customer Is likely to be stored as a record with 
at least these fields: account number; Iasi name; 
Initials; ad dress; amount currently owed.)
A Ole is a whole big  complete bunch of 
information lhal Is Btored someplace. In many 
applications a file Is composed of numerous 
sim ilar, consecutive reco rd s. For Instance, 
an electric company may well store ihe records 
for all of its custom ers on a magnetic lape, 
o rd ered  by account num ber (account 000001 
first).
Storing sequences of sim ilar records In 
long files is typical of b usiness programs, 
though p erhaps this should begin lo change.
It's especially suited to batch processing, 
that is, handling many records In ihe same 
way at the same tim e. (See "System Programs.")
Now, the divisions of field, record and 
file are conceptual: they are what the program­
m er thinks about, baaed on the Information 
needs o f a specific computer program .
ftt-t
jhti :
BLOCKS
A block Is something else, which may be 
related only lo qu irk s of ihe situation.
A block is a section of stored material, 
divided either according to the divisions of the 
dala or peculiarities of the device holding i t , 
such as a disk d riv e. Short records may be 
stored many to a block. If records are long 
they may be made up of many blocks.
-♦In  particular, tape blocks can be almost 
any size, w hile disk blocks often have a certain 
fixed size (number of characters o r bits) based 
on the peculiarities of Ihe Individual device. 
(This can be a pain In the n eck.)
On ths other hand, due to. the q u irk s of 
magnetic recording, y our program usually can’t 
Just change something in the middle of a block; 
the whole disk block or tape file has to be re­
placed. This Is less trouble wilh a short disk 
block lhan a long tape file.
TRADITIONAL CONVEYER-BELT PROGRAMS
Many traditional b u sin e ss p rogram s are of 
this type, read in g  In one dala reco rd  at a  time, 
doing something to it (Buch as noting that an 
individual has paid the exact amount of h is gas) 
and w riting out a new reco rd  for that customer 
on the cu rren t month’s tap e.
THE PROBLEM
Standardized field s, blocks and records 
are often necessary o r convenient. But, on the 
other hand, the kinds of computer program s 
people find oppressive often have th e ir roots ln 
this kind of data storage and its associated styles 
of program m ing, especially the use of flxed-fleld 
records as the be-all and en d -all. T he more 
in teresting uses of the computer (interactive, 
o bliging, a rtistic .  e tc .) u se a g reater variety 
of data stru ctu res.
------------- ---- \ >
People's naive Idea of "program ming" la often a reasonable 
approximation to the notion of "data stru c tu re ." Data structure 
la how Information Is set u p . After it's set u p . programs 
can twiddle it; bu t the tw iddling options are based on how 
the information Is se t up to begin w ith.

A com puter language ia •  syaiepi for casting spells.
T his ! ■ nol « m etaphor but tn  exactly true statem ent. Each 
language h w  a vocabulary of commands, lhal Is, different 
order* you can give that are fundamental lo lhe Isnguage, 
and a i y n l » , thal i s .  rules about how to give the commands 
rig h t, and how you may fit them together and entw ine ihem.
Learning to w ork w ilh one language do esn 't mean 
you've learned a n o th er. You learn them one al a rime, 
but alter tome experience il gels easier.
There a re  com puter languages for testing rocketships 
and controlling oil refineries and making p ictu res. There 
are computer lan g v -g es for sociological statistics and designing 
automobiles. And there are computer languages which 
will do any of these th in g s, and more, bu l wilh more difficulty 
because they have no purpose built in . (Dul each of these 
general-purpose languagea lends to have its own outlook.)
Most program m ers have a favorite language o r Iwc, 
and this is not o rational m iller. T here are many different 
computer languages— in fact thousands— but w hat they 
all have In common is acting on Beries of instru ctio n s.
Beyond lhat, e v ery  language is different. So for each language, 
lhe question* are
WHAT ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS?
HOW DO THEY FIT TOGETHER?
Most com puter languages involve somehow typing 
in the commands of y our spell lo a computer set u p  for that 
language. (The computer is sel up by putting in  a bigger 
program , called the p rocessor for lhal language ■)* A  COWIM#

T hen, after v arious Steps, you gel lo try your p rogram .
Once you know  a language you con cast spells in 
il; bu t lhal d o e sn 't mean it's easy. A spell cast in a computer 
language will make the computer do what you w anl--
IF il's possible lo do ll
with lhal computer;
IF il's p ossible lo do it 
in lhat language:
IF you u sed the vocabulary
and ru les of Ihe language 
correctly; 
and IK you laid oul in the spell
a p la n  lhal would effectively 
do whai y c j hsd in mind.
BUT if you make a m istake in casting your spell, lhat is 
a BUG. (Aa you see from the iFs a Love, many types of 
bug are p o asible.) Program bugs call cause unfortunate 
results. (Supposedly a big NASA rocket failed in takeoff 
once because of a m isplactd dollar sign in a p rogram .) 
Getting [he bugs out of a program is Called debugging.
It'S very hard .
DESIGNING COMPUTER LANGUAGES
Every program m er who's designed a language, and 
created a p rocessor for ii. had certain typical uses in mind.
If you want lo create y our own language, you figure oul 
whai aorls of operations you would like lo have bn basic.
In ll, and how you would like il all lo fit together so as 
Id allow the v ariations you have in mind. Then you program 
your processor (which is usually very h a rd ).{\ IxVjrtfci'- e»rvitt cuf, 
fi|w ti\sJ )® 
klOlK,?
Basically there are two different methods.
A compiling language, 3uch as FORTRAN or COBOL, 
h as a compiler program , which sjis In the computer, and 
receives lhe input program .  or "source program ." the way 
the assem bler does. II analyzes the source program and 
substitutes for it an object program .  in machine Isnguage. 
which la a translation of the source p rogram .  and can actually 
be ru n  on the computer, The relation of the higher language 
is not one-to-one to machine language: many Instructions 
in machine language are often needed lo compile tt single 
instruction of the source program .  (A source program of 
100 lines can easily come oul a thousand lines long In lie 
output v e rsio n .) Moreover, because of the interdependency 
of the instructions in lhe source program . lhe compiler 
usually has to check various arrangements all over the 
program before it can generate the final code.
Most compilers come In several stages .  You have 
to put the first stage of Ihe compiler Inlo the computer, 
then ru n  In the source program .  and the first slage puls 
out a first intermediate version of the program , Then you 
pu t this version Into a second stage, which puls out a second 
intermediate version; and so on through various stages.
T his is done fairly automatically on big com pulers, bul 
on little machines il's a pain.
(In fact, compilers lend to be very slow program s; 
but thal depends on the amount of "optimising" they do, 
thst ia, how efficient they try  lo make the object program.)
An interpretive language w orks differently,  There 
sits in core a processor for the language called an interpreter;  
th is goes through the program one step al a tim e, actually 
carry in g  out each operation In the list and going on to the 
n e x t. TRAC and APL a re  interpretive: it’s a good way 
to do quickie languages.
Interpreters are perhaps Ihe eaBler method of the 
tw o lo g rasp , since they seem to correspond a little better
lo the way many people think of computers. T hat doesn't 
mean th ey 're belter. For program s that have to be run 
o ver and o v e r, compiling is usually more economical In 
lhe long ru n ; but for programs that have to be repeatedly 
changed , interpreters are often sim pler lo work wilh.
A BLACK ART
Making language processo rs, especially compilers, 
is widely regarded as a black a r t. Some people have (ricks 
lhat a re  virtual tradem arks (see below) .
Actually, the design of a language- - especially lhe 
sy n ta x , how its commands fit together-- strongly influences 
the design of its processor- BASIC and APL. for instance, 
w ork left-lo-right on each line, and top-to-bottom On a 
program . Both act on something stored in a work area.
TRAC, on the other hand, works leM-IO-rlght on a text 
strin g  lhat changes size like a rubber b a n d ,  Other languages 
exhibit comparsble differences.
MIXED CASES AND VARIATIONS (for lhe whimsical)
T here a re  a lot of mixed c a se s.  A load-and-go compiler 
(such as WATFOR) is put into the computer with the program  , 
compiles I t, and then starts it going immediately. An in terpret ive 
compiler looks up what lo do with a given instruction by in ­
terp retin g  it inlo a series of steps , bul compiling them instead 
of carry in g  them Out. (A firm called Digitek is well known 
for making very good compilers of Ihis ty p e .) An Incremental 
compiler jusl runs along compiling a command at a time; 
th is can be a lot faster bul has draw b ack s.

ALL COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARB EVEN­

Now, ll Is entirely possible lo write your 
program* si this leva], considering aAd arran­
ging rock-bottom commands. This Is called 
machine-language programming (and assembly 
programming: see eaamples a little laler on). 
Indeed, working al this level Is very highly 
reapeeted In some quart e ra .  Other* avoid ll.
Thla Is a very serious mailer of taste and whsl 
you're working on.
Higher-level languages, seen on ear liar 
pages, have more convenient forms for people, 
but must be irmsUted, either ahead of lima or 
on a running basis, lo Ihe bottom-most codes 
thal make things happen lh the machine. All of 
them are built out of machine language. Writ­
ing (he language processors, programs lhal 
enact or translate these higher-level languages. 
Is considered a black art. (Bee p .JO .)
Every programmable device has a "machine 
language." or rock bottom code system thal acti­
vate* the thing directly; ita program follower 
responds electrically 10 these codes, and enacts 
them m e  instruction al a tim e.
True compulers are programmable devices

Ihelr sequence of operations and do olher versa­
tile stuff.■ t v *  W  * 4  M b
Computers are basically alike. Ignore Ihelr 
appearances: a roomful of roaring cabinet* may 
have a great deal In common with a small blinking 
boa; Indeed, Ihey may have the aame architecture, 
or structure, and therefore be Ihe same computer.
The structure of computer*, In ihelr glorious 
similarities and fiudnating difference*, is called 
computer architecture.
(For the architecture of a beginner's com­
puter , see p . J *; tor (he architecture of some 
famous compulers, seefp.1®-} .)
Computer architecture covers three main 
things: register* (place* where something happens 
to Information); memories (places where nothing 
happens to Information); their Interconnections; 
and machine language, oil lhe bottom-level Instruc­
tions (for (hi* last see "Rock Bottom," p. 32,).
REGISTERS AND M EM ORIES
Computers are made, basically, of two 
thing*: register* snd memories.  A register is 
where something happens to Information: a memory 
is where nothing happens lo information. Let's 
go over lhal alowly.
A register 1* a place where something 
happens to Information: lhe information ean be 
flipped around, tested, changed by arithmetic, 
o r whatever. (We noted earlier lhal registers 
are whai connect a computer 10 its accessories. 
They are also principal parts of the computer 
itself.)
A memory la a place where nothing hap­
pens to Information. A program pula the Infor­
mation there, end there ll alays IUI some pro­
gram pulls 1 1 out again or replaces it.
A main or general register (often called 
lhe accumulator, for no good reason) Is where 
the program brings Ihings lo be worked on. 
tested, compared, added lo and so on. There 
can be several of them In a computer.
Other register* perform other functions In 
the computer; * given computer's design, or archi­
te c tu re . is largely lhe arrangement of registers 
and lha operations lhal lake place between them.
The reason we don't Juat have aU register* —  
and no memories *t ail—  1* thal registers tradi­
tionally coal more lhan memories. (However, some 
machines are being tried lhat have aU working 
registers Instead of memory. See ST ARAN. p .H J.)
Memories come In all sizes and apeeda.
So lola of compulers have big slow memories, 
such as disk memories, along with Ihelr small 
faat memories.
A memory consists of numerous holding 
places or storage location*, each holding one 
standard piece of Information for Ihe computer, 
a word having a specific number of bits (eee p.
.) W e must Blress: a "COMPUTER W ORD"
HAS NOTHING TO DO W ITH ENGLISH WORDS OR 
ALPHABETICAL CHARACTERS. The term refer* 
to * specific machine's standard memory slot, 
having a Axed number of bit position*.
One Important reason (or Ihls standardisa­
tion I* lhal each holding place, o r memory loca­
tion, can bo given a number or addre**.  If 
every slot in the memory ha* an address, Infor­
mation can be stored In specific place*:and gotten back on ilace*:
i*o*r*W 7 1
A core memory has a definite rhythm or 
cycle. Into which tl divide* the passing time.
The memory cycle of a core memory Is so Im­
portant that its duration is often called the 
cycle lime of (he confer. A request lo ihe core 
memory m»de at lhe beginning of the cycle 
is honored al lhe end of the cycle. Core cycles 
are very fast, being these day* about one 
microsecond, or millionth of * second.
A core memory can only perform one act 
(store or fetch) during one memory cycle.
Core cycle* during which nothing la 
requested of Ihe memory simply go b y .
One last point about core memories. The 
number which specifies an address to lhe mem­
ory is a binary pattern-- Jusl like all the olher 
Information (see "Binary Patlem s," p ,  3 }  ).
(Or more exactly, whatever binary pattern Is sup­
plied lo Ihe memory as the address to store or 
from which to fetch, thal pattern will be treated 
as the address to store or from which to fetch, 
that pattern will be treated as a binary number 
whether it was supposed to be or not. It could 
be (he alphabetic word ORINCH which got there 
by mistake (see "Debugging." p. ) . bul Ihe 
memory will treat 11 as an address number and go 
to the address specified by lhat pattern.
The word length
(number of bit-spaces In a main 
register and memory slot)
The number of main registers
and what (hey can do; i.e .. how 
they are sel up and what operations 
can lake place In and among them: 
i . e . ,
the Instruction Sel (see nearby);
The amount of memory;
The accessories or peripherals;
The cycle time.
Here's the computer, Ihen. in ail Its glory: 
a device with a symbolic program, stored In a 
memory, being stepped through by a program 
follower,
The commands of the program cause the 
program follower to carry oul the individual 
steps requested by each command of the program.How, you aak desperaialy. do** thl* innar- 
mo*l program follower work? The on* lhat la 
built Into lh* m n p u ta rt
Aha.
Basically II consist* of two •pacific regis­
ters , the Program Counter (usually abbreviated 
PC) and the Instruction Register (usually abbre­
viated IR), and other electronic Ruff, loosely 
termed "deoidlng logic.”
(Since we are already visual icing the 
program follower aa a Uttle hand. 1*1'* think of 
the index finger aa the program counter and 
Imagine that the thumb ean (Up an Instruction

WHEN a program la set into operation, tiw

ICALLY HAS ONE ADDED TO IT, SO IT POINTS 
TO THB NEXT INSTRUCTION.
The instruction pulled from memory ia 
held in the command or Instruction register 
and there decoded by the system's electronic*.
II Is of no concern to lhe programmer how 
thia la done elecinxilcaUy. (And Indeed elec­
tronics Is generally of little concern lo computer 
people, unless ihey are trying to design or op­
timise compulers or other device* themselve*. 
Indeed, lhe electronic technique* are constantly 
changing.)
All we need lo know Is that an electrical 
decoding system (called the logic circuits) carries 
out lhe specific instruction—  for Instance, by 
■hutting off the path to Ihe memory, turning on 
the adding circuit, and opening path* through 
Ihe adding circuit and back lo the main register.
Now lhat the program counter holds (he 
number of the neat Instruction it In turn 1 *  
accordingly retched and executed.
And so It continues.
When an instruction calls for a Jump or 
branch In the program, whai happens?
The jump command causes a new number 
lo be stuffed Into the program counter, that's 
what, and so (hat's where Ihe program goes next.

Bucky the Folk Here, one that will u se a teeny 
FIDO on a chip (the coming th in g ). attached to 
three ro w s of numerical readouts (like those 
on pocket calculators).
T h is application le nol so ab su rd  a s you 
might th in k .
It ia obviously quite simple In principle.
It * u i  let u a see ewoe of the w ay s that 
the rock-bottom  machine languages of com puters 
are u s e d .
N aturally this got saved for la st, and 
what la p rese n te d  h ere show s ll.
The example waa meant to be a case of 
n ot-very-num erical programming that would 
ahow the abstracu ieae of it ell. T he p rogram  
Itself has no intrin sic quality related to the 
problem; lhat much should be visible.
A nyhow . I programmed th is myself a few 
weeke ago in the FIDO language, and was v ery 
pleased w ith It, bul then discovered a couple 
of appalling b u g s. As dme closed In on this 
project I a sk ed  my friend Mike O 'B rien to  code 
th s p rogram , and he kindly consented, taking 
time out of hie previous weekend plans. H ere 
Is M ike's p ro g ra m , for which I am grateful.
HowEVer, after ll w as eet In type, Mike 
re  all te d  thal 1 1  loo haa some gro ss flaws and 
would nol w ork aa here p resented. We thought 
of having •  chocolate chip cookie contest for 
co rrections, eending oul chocolate chip cookies 
lo en tran ts fixing ll u p , bul we don't have 
euch a com puter and we wouldn't run the p ro ­
gram U we had  one anywa y . so see If you can 
gel lhe b a sic ■ idea of it. and If you a re  a real 
wlee guy Ax the program for your own satie- 
faction, and that will be that.
The basic Idea le that we have a FIDO. 
presum ably on a single Integrated circuit c hip, 
attached to th irteen  external devices (or p e rip h ­
e ra ls, o r Input-output d evices, o r I/O devices 
o r w hatever). T hese devices are a tim er o r 
clock, w hieh reaches zero once p er minute— 
thle Is a com puter clock, meaning a tim er, not 
something lhal people can read -- and the th ree 
rows of num erical readouts that are the d esired  
Superwatch.
For sim plicity's sake we assume h ere that 
each num eral le interfaced to do either Inpul or 
outpul; th u s ihe FIDO computer can ask any 
given num eral w hat it sa y s, and change Its con­
tents.
T he finished Wrlstwatch Is going to give 
dme on a tw entyfour-hour b a sis, nol tw elve, like 
al NASA and suchlike places. After 12: $9 comes 
13:00. A fter 23:59 comes 01:00.

The b u lk  or lhe program la occupied with 
testing the num eral* and changing them. How­
ev er, in p ro portions of activity, the poor thing 
la going to spend most of its dme saying. "la 
ll lime yet? Is li dm e yet? Ia It dise yet?"
(Thai's the se co n d , third and fourth In stru ctio n .)
Because the FIDO selects the particu lar 
input-oulput device with the laat seven b its of 
an input o r o utput instruction, this haa been 
done with "ad d rea s modification" arithmetic: 
creating an output Instruction to address a p a r­
ticular device b y  adding (he Instruction to the 
name of the d e v ice . This ia an ancient and- -  
honorable program m ing trick .
In se v eral cases, the program  chooses a

Thl® *• whal O '®  program looks like in Ihs 
computer's core memory. (A prlnloul 
like the following la called a machlne- 
laniruagB Hating. )
Since all ihe addresses are filled In, thia 
program la said lo be In absolute 
b inary.  L f they weren't filled In, It 
would be called relocatable binary.
Hachine-language listings come In different 
flavors. A binary listing (or dump)
Ifl generally In ones and zeroes.  An 
octal listing groups (he bits by threea 
and substitutes the numbers zero 
through seven for ihe different com­
bination a of three blls. The olher 
main kind, Ihe hexadecimal listing 
or dump (an IBM thing), groups Ihe 
blls by fours and substitutes the num­
ber* 0-9 and the letters A to P. for 
the sixteen different combinations of 
four blia.

o w m v r sThia la What the program looks like when 
you sel ii up for ihe Assembler,  
which la the easier way.
A program laid oul like Ihle la called an 
Assembly Listing. Studying ll may 
help you debug (see p. J O ) .
An easy-lo-remember alphabetical code is 
used to represent each final Instruc­
tion dee 1  red .  Such an abbreviation 
Is called a mnemonic; usually they're 
more cryptic. The mnemonics arc 
turned by Ihe assembler Into the 
binary opcode.
You don'l have lo know ihe actual addresses 
In core memory.  you just use alpha­
betical names or labels, and the Ag­
ue mbler figures oul where they really 
go and put* in the binary addresses.
Desired numbers, such as B , are plugged
Into Ihe address parts of Instructions.
YOUR OW N  COMMENTS (here set off with 
slashea) can stay here too.
ln Ihls FIDO example, ihe Assembler follows 
two common practices: il recognizes 
a label because II ends In a comma, 
and recognizes a comment because It 
begins with a slash.

It's a pain trying to keep track of binary

That’s assembly language. (And the conversion 
program we pul our alphabetical Into, 10 turn 
them back into ihe binary patterns lhat really 
run ihe machine-- lhal conversion program ia 
called ihe Assembler.)
An assembler is a direct and non-tricky 
translator, intended mainly lo handle the details 
of exact transposition between instruction code­
words and the exactly corresponding machine- 
language program that you intend.
IT WORKS LIKE THIS: The assembler 
scans through the assembly-language program,  
testing the successive alphabetical characters. 
After finding the key punctuation marks or 
delimiters (shown as comma and slash for the 
FIDO assembler), it scans for the alphabelical 
instruction mnemonics, and tranalalea them by 
a table in core memory Into the corresponding 
binary codes.  (It Ignores everything on a line 
after a s la s h  , which is lucky, since ln the 
comments you may use words which are the same 
as instruction mnemonics.)
The assembler also counts the instructions, 
and (starting wherever you say) figures where 
in core memory the Instructions (and any data 
o r spaces you put In) go. Then it makes a Hat 
of these addresses, called a symbol table (also 
called e name Hal al less elegant places).
An assembler Is ihe simplest form of 
compiler (see p .3 o ) . Basically it translates an 
sssembly-language program, which cannot be run 
directly. Into a binary program which can,
Then from this symbol table ll fills Ihe 
resulting binary addresses Into Iho binary com­
mands of the program.
Aren't you glad you don'l have lo?
Cenerally the assembler then sends oul

such as a dlak memory or paper tape punch.

Thia is a PDP-11, one of the world's best-designed minicomputers (see p. I f£*).  
The PDP-11 is a 16-bit machine. Shown ie Model 45, the fastest PDP-11, which  
has various special features. Stripped, with 4K of core memory (that's 4096  
locations), it costs about $13 grand. A smaller PDP-11 goes for some $5000.Minicomputers are now being found 
in highschools; active marketing to 
highschools is now being done by both 
DEC and Hewlett-Packard.
Children's museums in Brooklyn 
and Boston have recently obtained PDP- 
11s for the kids to interact with. In 
the Brooklyn case, the computer will 
even demonstrate the exhibit and help 
the child discover things about it, in 
ways worked out by Gordon Pask (see p.
J M 3 ) *
In the future, networks of minis 
may be the systems to offer low-cost 
information services to the home (for 
speculations, see 5 1).
But minis will alsA start to make big­
ger and bigger incursions on the terri­
tory of the big machines. For instance, 
one group proposes a time-sharing sys­
tem which will simply consist of Novas 
interconnected in a ring, the so-called 
STAR-RING, which will supposedly com­
pete with big time-sharing.
A minicomputer simply means a 
small computer, no different in 
principle from the big ones (see 
next spread), and it can do all the 
same things except as limited by 
speed and memory capacity.
(Mind, we are talking about 
real computers, not the little cal- 
culators you "hold in your hand that 
just do arithmetic. A real compu­
ter is one which works on stored 
programs and all kinds of data, 
working not merely on numbers but 
on such other things as text, mu­
sic and pictures if supplied with 
appropriate programs; see flip side.)
There is some argument over 
what constitutes a minicomputer; 
basically we will say it's any com­
puter with a word length of.18 bits 
or less (see "Binary Patterns,1 *  p.
27). (Some companies, like Data- 
craft and Interdata, are trying to 
peddle their worthy computers as 
"minicomputers" even though they're 
24 and 32 bits, respectively, but 
that's very odd. Interdata says 
any computer under ten thousand is 
a mini-- which means all computers 
will be minis by and by; a vexing 
thing to do to the term.)
Traditionally minicomputers 
come with much less. In the old 
days pretty much all the programs 
you got with it were an assembler 
(see p, 35) and' a debugger (see p. 
Jo) and a Fortran compiler (see p. 
£54-) if you were lucky. Today, 
though, with minis having highly 
built-up software like (see pp. Y 0-y£ 
for descriptions) the PDP- 8, the 
PDP-11 and the Nova, you can get a 
lot of different assemblers, to­
gether with Fortran, BASIC, and a 
little disk or cassette operating 
system (see p. t fS') to make your 
life a little easier.The idea of owning a computer 
may* seem strange to some people, 
but with prices falling as they are 
it makes perfect sense. Numerous 
individuals own minis, and as the 
price continues to drop the number 
will shoot up. For several families 
with children to pool together and 
buy one for the kids makes a lot of 
sense. One friend of mine has an 8,  
another is contemplating an 11.
(I've been trying to get ray own for 
years; perhaps this book...) Any­
how, the general price range is now 
$3000 to $6000 plus accessories, 
and that's dropping fast. Rental 
is usually a great mistake: prices 
are very high and after six months 
or so you'll have paid for it with­
out owning it. (But names of rental 
places will be found in this book, 
and some of them may offer good ar­
rangements.) Minis may now be had 
in quantity for $1000 each-- price 
of the PDP- 8A in May 1974-- and soon 
that will be the consumer price.
Unfortunately, the price of the 
computer itself is dropping faster 
than that of the accessories, such 
as the basic terminal you'll need, 
which still weighs in at $1000-5000. 
Moreover, as soon as you want to do 
anything serious you'll need a disk 
(starting around $4 500) or at least 
a cassette memory (starting around 
$1500). But these prices too will 
come way down as the consumer market 
opens.
Some of us minicomputer freaks 
see little real need for big computers. 
Minicomputers are splendid for inter­
active and "good-guy" systems (see 
P* 13)» as personal machines, to han­
dle typing and bookkeeping; even for 
business systems, if you recognize 
the value of working out your own in 
BASIC or, say, TRAC Language.
Minicomputers are being put in­
side all manner of other equipment 
to handle complex control. (However, 
for repetitive simple tasks, the lat­
est thing is microprocessors (see p. 
t fl f) , which cost less but are harder 
to program.)Here's that selfsame PDP-11  
in its overall setting. With  
peripherals shown, plus the  
magnificent Vector General  
display (shown later on in  
book, & elsewhere),
this setup cost well over a  
hundred grand. (This is the  
Circle Graphics Habitat, oth­
erwise known as the Chemistry  
Department Computer, U. Illi­
nois at Chicago Circle. Why  
do chemists need such things?  
See p. 1.)

There is great confusion as between 
various types of small computer, with the 
latest stupid term, "microcomputer," add­
ing to the confusion. We have:
minicomputer or mini
Traditionally, any computer hav­
ing an architecture (memory and 
main registers) of 18 bits or 
less. Lately, unfortunately, 
some people have been adver­
tising their 24-bit and even 
32-bit computers as minis. This 
is just confusing.
(They base this on the fact 
that "minicomputer" has also re­
ferred to a machine sold without 
a lot of programs. But that's 
really a separate issue.) 
microprocessor
Two-level computer (see p. ) •  
microcomputer
Crummy term apparently being used 
to mean any tiny computer, regard­
less of its structure. Thus all 
computers will be "microcomputers" 
in a few years. This clarifies 
nothing as to their structure or 
use.  
midi computer
Remember midi skirts? Well, this 
term has been used for computers 
larger than 16 bits or faster than 
usual, by people seeking to give 
the impression that their machines 
are bigger than minis and less than 
biggies. Even the PDP-10 (a genuwine 
biggie) has sometimes been called

The operator muses at the console of the main computer at the University 
of Illinois at Chicago Circle. It is an IBM 370 model 156, which rents for 
about $50,000 a month, including all accessories and a dozen or so terminals 
—  in the parlance of big-computer people, a "medium-sized installation."
This is a big computer.
In principle it’s no different from a small one; but it has 
bigger memories, more registers, more program followers. There 
are more specialized parts.and more things happening at once. 
(Thus the term "digital computer complex” is sometimes used for 
a big computer.) It comes supplied with a monitor program or 
operating system (see p. ^5) and a variety of other utility pro­
grams and language processors.
Biggies have many ominous and seemingly incomprehensible 
things to scare the layman.
For one thing, where is the computer? All you see is a lot 
of roaring cabinets. Whicli is it"?
Answer: all of them. "The computer" is divided among the 
different cabinets (note diagram and cluster of pictures locating 
the operator among them, below).. The external devices or peri­
pherals (see p. 5*7) are usually in separate housings. Usually 
there is one single box or "mainframe" containing core memory, 
mafn registers, program-following circuitry, etc., as in the ma­
chine illustrated, but these things don’t have to be in one box, 
and sometimes aren't.Operator's console of 
this particular setup. 
The operator may use the 
keyboard or light^-pen 
(see p. JM23) to select 
among waiting programs, 
submitted by various 
programmers and depart­
ments .
The parts of a computer are set 
up to be gotten at, to be refilled and 
repaired. Their innards swing open 
like refrigerators. Similarly, the 
wiring of computers is in separate sec­
tions or modules ("module" merely be­
ing today's stylish term for "unit”), 
having very orderly connections among 
them. Individual circuits are on cir­
cuit sheets or “cards" which plug in 
sideways and may be replaced easily. 
There’s nothing really computerish 
about this, it’s merely sensible con­
struction; but it is traditional in 
other fields to build something as a 
tangle of wires. (When TV makers fol­
low these rational practices, they 
call it "space age construction.")
Why are the different parts so 
far apart? So there's room to swing 
them open, refill or change them, sit 
down and repair them. Refrigerators 
could, and perhaps should, also be 
built in separate sections, but it's 
not traditional. Automobiles can't 
be spread out because they have to en­
dure the jostles of the road. But 
computers like this baby aren't going 
anywhere.
Also intimidating is the fact 
that you have to step up as you enter 
a computer room. That"^ because com­
puter rooms ordinarily have raised 
floors, permitting cables to be run 
around among the pieces of equipment 
without your tripping.
Computer rooms are generally lit 
by millions of fluorescent bulbs, 
making them garishly bright. This is 
simply tradition.
Big computers can have millions 
of words of core memory. Moreover, 
there are usually several disk drives 
and tape drives, as seen in the pic­
tures, used to hold data and programs. 
(Some of the programs are the system 
programs, especially the language pro­
cessors and the operating system-- 
see p. ^5*-- but otheT programs and 
most of the data belong to the users.)
AN OPERATOR IS NOT A PROGRAMMER
Cindy Woelfer is the day-shift operator of Circle's big computer. 
The job mainly consists of changing dinks and tapes, starting and stop­
ping different jobs listed on the scope, and restarting the computer 
when the system crashes (gratuitously ceases operation).
Ms. Woelfer, a thoughtful person, says she does not find her job 
very stimulating. She can program, but the job doesn't involve pro­
gramming. It's also a lonely job. Non-systems people, except Mayor 
Daley, aren't ordinarily allowed around. About the only people to talk 
to are the systems programmers who stop through to look at the scope 
and see whether their programs are up next.

y w.CWMi]Ii used to be traditional for 
machines like this to have many many 
rows of blinking lights, showing what 
was in all the main registers at any 
fraction of a second. But there's 
really no point in seeing all that, 
since about all you can tell from it 
is whether the computer is going or 
not (if it's not, the lights are stop­
ped) and other high-level impressions. 
For that reason some big computers, 
beginning with the CDC 6600, started 
doing away with the fancy lights and 
bringing written messages to the op­
erator on a CRT scope instead (for 
lots more on the glories of CRTs, 
see the flip side, pp. |)P\ 2.1<
B ig  computers can have multiple 
program followers and sets of regis­
ters (a program follower and its 
main registers are together called a 
CPU, Central Processing Unit). A 
computer with two CPUs, i.‘e., two 
sets of program followers and regis­
ters to carry the program§^5ut, is 
called a dual processor; a computer 
with more than two CPUs is called a 
multi-processor.
Separate independent sections of 
core memory may be put in one computer, 
allowing separate program followers 
and data channels to work at the same 
time. (Note: a "bank" of core memory 
is an independent section. Except in 
this sense of "core memory bank" or 
"core bank," there is no other correct 
usage of the layman's vague term 
"memory bank." Computer people only 
say "memories," and distinguish fur­
ther among core, disk, tape, etc.
Note that "<Iata banks" are a separate 
issue-- see "Issues," p.J? .)
DINOSAURS?
Many computer people, the author 
included, entertain certain doubts a- 
bout the long-term usefulness of big 
computers, since minicomputers are 
cheaper, especially in the long run, 
and can actually be in the offices and 
homes where people create and use the 
information. Big computers are neces­
sary for time-sharing (see p. 45) and 
huge "number-crunching" jobs (see 
"Grosch's Law," nearby). However, it 
will soon be cheaper to put standard­
ized number-crunching jobs in stand­
alone or accessory hardware; see "Mi­
croprocessors," p. 4^.
Fans of big computers also argue 
that they are necessary for business 
programming, but that only means tra­
ditional business programming-- non- 
mteractive and batch-oriented. For 
tomorrow's friendly and clear business 
systems, networks of minis may be pref­
erable. But makers of big computers 
may be unwilling to adroit this possi- 
billty.
Tends to  happen several times a day.
M inicom puters a re  so nifty lhat we may ask 
why h av e big com puters at all. T h e answ er ie 
that th e re  are co n siderable econom ies, especially 
In applications that r e q u ire  many repetitive Oper­
ations and don't n e ed  Interaction w ith u sers.
A hypothesis about the economy of big 
com puters was form ulated a long time ago by 
H erb ert J .R . G rosch, onetime d irecto r of IBM's 
Watson Lab and now a h eav y  d e tra cto r of IBM.
T h u s It is called G rosch's Law . T h e  idea is 
basically that th e re  is a equare-Iaw  relationship 
betw een a m achine's size and Its po w er (narrow ly 
defined in term s of the cost of m illions of o p eratio n s, 
and w ithout c o n sid erin g  the advantages of in teractive 
system s or oth er features w hich may be of more 
ultimate valu^). A n y w ay , w h en  I aaked him recen tly  
fo r h is formulation o f G ro sch 's Law , I got the fol­
lowing:
"G ro sch 's Law (formal): Economy in com puting is a s th e 
square root of the sp eed .
(inform al): If y o u  w ant to  do it ten limes 
as cheap, you have to  do it a h undred times 
as fast.
(in te rp retiv e): No m atter how clev er th e 
h ardw are boys a re , the softw are boys p iss It aw ay !"

The PDP-8 warn designed by Gordon Bell  
(in it* original version, the PDF-5) about  
I960. Originally it cost about $25,000| am  
of May 1974'that price ia d o n  to about $ 3 0 0 0, 
or learn than a thousand dollar* lf you want  
to buf the eircuita and wire It all up your-

you'll find t h a  in industrial plant* and  
■Moai, or oven hidden in the weirdest equip—  
■•at, from typesetting devices to big disk  
drive*. At universities all over there are  
kids who loo« t h a  Inside out.
Today the PDP-8 s e w  archaic, with its  
ons aecwlator and awkward addressing ickeatti  
you can only get to ZS6 different addresses in  
core aaory directly, and it's chopped up into  
page*. But for its time it was a brilliant  
design, packed like a parachute, and even to­
day there are people who swear by it. (But  
look at what Bell’s done latelyi the PDP-11.)
So many programs exist for the FDP-fl , 
tlwwigh , and so m e h  sentimental fondness, that  
It will be with us for the foreseeable future.  
Ttaa the ■teclcy's Wristvstch1 example (seen,  
dl-ft is not totally frivolousi we may aeaume  
that a PDP-8 on one or two wristwatch-sized  
chips is only a year or so away. But let's  
hope they do the 11 first.

The IBM 7090 was the classic computer.  
Introduced about I960 and mostly gorte by '66,  
it was simple and powerful, with clean and  
decent instructions. With its daughter the  
7094, it became virtually standard at uni­
versities, research institutions and scien­
tific establishment*. At many installations  
that went on t-» 36 0s they long for those  
clearminded days.
The 90 had three index registers and  
fifteen bits to specify core addresses.
(Thia mesnt, of course, that core memory  
could ordinarily be no longer than 32,768  
word* (a32KB—  see "Binary patterns,* p. 73.)  
A later model, the 94, went up to 7 index  
registere, since there were three bit* to  
eelect them with.
Though these were million-dollar a a .  
chinee ten year* ago, you now hear of them  
being offered free to anyone who'll cart  
them away) partly because they needed a lot  
of power, airconditioning and oso on. But  
they were great number crunchers. (If you  
want a 90, 1 believe that 90 lookalikes are  
still available from Standard Machines in  
California.)

The design of the 360, which was basically decent, Is gen­
erally  a ttrib u te d  to Amdahl, Blaauw and Brooks. Those who hate 
i t ,  and there are many, base th eir complaints largely on the 
re stric tio n s and complications associated with its  operating 
systea OS, which is notoriously Inefficient (see p. < 1 5 ).
The arch itectu re of the 360 was quite s ia lla r  to the PDP-6 
(now the PDP-10), designed about the saae tiae: sixteen aaln 
general-purpose registers of over th irty b its , and using the 
16  aaln re g is ters as either accuaulators or index registers.
A  curious fora of addressing was adopted, called "base- 
reg ls ter ad d ressing.1 ’  This had certain advantages for the oper­
ating sy stea th a t waa planned, and was thought to be su fficien t­
ly powerful that you wouldn't need Indirect Addressing. T w o  
aaln re g is te rs were required, one holding a "base" aore or less 
equal to the prograa's starting address, end an "lndei register," 
whose contents are added to the base to specify an address.
Often a th ird  nuaber, or ’’ o ffse t," la added as well.
Tli* idea o f th is technique Is that prograas can be "relo ­
cata b le ,'1  operating anywhere In core aeaory. A  few instructions 
at the beginning of each program can ascertain where it  is run* 
Ding fro a , and estab lish  the Base accordingly.
The basic idea of the. 360 seeas to have been doped out for 
B u ltip ro g ra n in g , or the simultaneous running of several pro­
grams in co re, a feature IB M  has pushed heavily with th is coa-

The main differences between the 360 and the PDP-6 snd 1 0  
represent conscious and legitimate and arguable design decisions. 
To fans o f the PDP-6 and 10, here are the 360's aaln drawbacks:
N O  INDIRECT A D D R E S S IN G . This was because, within the ad­
dressing scheme adopted, indirect addresses could not be adjusted 
autom atically. (But i t  also makes prograas more in efficien t, 
thus more p ro fitab le  to IBM .)
N O  STACK. W hy? Too expensive, said Amdahl, Blaauw and 
Brook* In th* IB M  Systeas Journal. Funny, they have stacks on 
IS O O O  PD P-lls-- and i t  wouia nave saved everybody a lo t of 
money on programming.
H O  M E M O R Y  M A P P 1 N C  (except on certain aodels). Where the 
PDP-6's successor, the PDP-lo, autoaatlcally takes care of re­
d istrib u tin g  addresses in core to service every program a* if 
i t  were operating froa location tero on up, the 360 le ft this 
general problem to local p rograners and (on certain levels) to 
operating systems.
Handling th is autoaatlcally in the PDP-10’s herdware ob­
viates the complications of base-lndec addressing and makes pos­
sib le the e ffic ien c ie s of Indirect addressing.

no longer makes computers, Univac is servicing the ones they

and a tte n tio n  centered instead upon Che sta c k ,  
a hig h -lev el prograaaing device (see box on

I M T E ^ i U G L t D .The Stack is a mechanism-- e ith e r b u ilt 
into the coaputer ("hardware") o r Incorpora­
ted in a prograa ("softw are” ) which allows a 
coaputer to keep track of a v a st nuaber of 
d ifferen t a c tiv itie s , In terru p tio n s and coa- 
p lic a tio n s a t the saae time.
B asically, I t Is a aechanisa which allows 
a prograa to throw soaothing over Its shoulder 
in order to do soaething e ls e , then reach hack 
over its  shoulder to get back what I t was 
previously working on. But no n a tte r  how aany 
things i t  throws over its  shoulder, everything 
stays orderly and continues to work saoothly, 
t i l l  i t  has resuaed everything and finished 
thea a ll.
I t goes like th is : i f  the prograa has 
to sec aside one thing, i t  puts that one thing 
in core aeaory a t a place sp e cifie d  by a 
nuaber called a stack p o in te r. Then i t  adds 
one to the stack p o in ter, to be Teady in ease 
soaething else has to go on the stack. This 
is called a PU SH .
W hen a prograa is ready to resuae a 
ious a c tiv ity , it  sub tracts one froa the 
stack p ointer and fetches whatever th a t j 
p o in ter points to. This is c alled  a POP.
It aay not be laaed iately  obvious, but 
th is trick  has iaaense power. For instance, 
we aay stack any nuaber of things together-- 
the addresses of programs, data we are moving 
between prograas, interm ediate r e su lts, and 
codes that show what the coaputer was doing 
previously.
Using stacks, prograas Bay use each other 
very freely . It is p o ssib le, for instance, 
to juap aaong subroutines-- independent l i t t l e  
prograas-- w illy -n illy , using a stack to keep 
track of where you've been.
In th is case the stack holds the previ 
locations and intermediate d a ta, so t>  
prograa follower can go back where it 
froa at the end of each subroutine.ThisBakes possible "re -e n tran t" prograas

Stacks are also used for handling "interrupts"

coaputer to se t aside one Job for another. 
Having a b u ilt-in  hardware stack enables the 
in te rru p ts to p ile  up without confusion:
F in ally , stack arith m etic, lik e  that done on 
the Burroughs S55B, enables arithm etic (and

Stack prograaaing tends to be e ff ic ie n t, 
p a rtic u la rly  in i t s  use of core aeaory.
Soae languages, such as Algol and T R A C

In e le c tro n ic s , a "bus" is a coaaon 
conneetor th a t supplies power or signals to 
and froa several destin atio n s. In coaputers, 
a "bus" Is a coaaon connection aaong several 
points, using carrying a coaplex p a ra lle l 
signal.
The Grand Bus, a new idea aaong coaputers, 
is catching on. (The te r i Is used here be­
cause the co llo q u ial te ra , "Unibus," is a D E C  
tradeaark.)
B asically the Grand Bus is a connector 
of Multiple w ires that goes aaong several
Eleces of equlpaent. So far th a t's  ju st a 
us. But a Grand Bus is one that allows the 
d ifferen t pieces of equlpaent to be changed 
and replaced e a sily , because signals any 
conon piece o f equlpaent ju st go out on the 
bus.
This Beans th a t the interface problea

In other words, DEC's PDP-11, 
which has already cut into sales 
of th eir PDP-8 12-bit se ries and 
PDP-15 18-blt se rie s , aay soon cut 
into its  PDP-10 36-b it se ries-- as 
designer Bell unveils (perhaps) 
aonster PDP-lls in arrays or double 
word-length o r whatever.
The PDP-11 was designed by C. Gordon Bell 
and his associ; # s a t Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
s ity . In designing the a rc h ite ctu re , and e s­
p ecially the In stru ctio n -se t, they siau lated  
a wide v ariety of p o s s ib ilitie s  before the 
fin al design was decided. The resu ltin g  ar­
chitecture is ex treaely e ffic ie n t and powerful 
(see box, "The l l ' s  Modes”).Basically il is a 16-bit Machine, with 
most instructions operating on 8 -bii data as 
w ell.
There are eight aain re g is te rs. Two, 
though, function specially- the prograa coun­
ter (that part of the prograa follower that 
holds the nuaber of the next in stru c tio n ), and 
the hardware stack p o in ter, both follow the 
saae prograaaing rules as the aain re g is te rs-- 
an unusual technique. Thus a juap in the pro­
graa is siaply a naove" In stru ctio n , in which 
the next progrea address is "aoved” into aain 
reg is ter 17, the prograa counter.
In addition, a ll ex tern al devices seea to 
the prograa to be stored in core aeaory. That 
Is, the Interface reg isters of accessories 
have "addresses" nuaerically sim ilar to core 
locations-- so the prograa ju s t "aoves" data, 
with M O V E  in stru ctio n s, to doorways in core. 
(This Is fa c ilita te d  by the autoaatlc handling 
of previously bothersoae s tu f f , lik e  Ready,
Halt and Done b its .)
Physically a ll devices are slaply attached 
to a great sash of wires c alled  a Unibus. (See

there w ill be a microprocessor in your r e f rig e r ­

and p o ssib ly  your w allet. ( I f  you d o n 't believe

the la s t couple of years. The chip those are 
b u ilt around coat* five bucks. But next coae the

Microprocessors should not be c a lle d  a lc ro - 
ro an u te ra. a t e n  that seeas to have cap tivated 
Wall S tre e t la te ly . "Mlcrocoaputer" ju s t aeans 
any teeny coaputer; but there is an eaact and 
c ru c ial d ifferen ce betaeen an ordinary coaputer 
(whatever its  s iie )  and a alcroproceseor (what­
ever i t s  s it e ) .
A  aicroprocessor is a two-level coap u ter.
You w ill reaeaber froa the "Rock Bottoa" 
sectio n  (pp. 32-3) th at every coaputer has an 
In tern a l language of binary p atterna or "nachine 
language" ( Illu s tr a te d  In horrendous d e ta il tn 
the prograa called  "Bucky’s R rlstw atch," p p .35-4).
W ell, a aicroprocessor has two le v e ls . It 
has an unpor-lovel prograa follower w ith its  r 
binary progran; but each In stru ctio n  o: 
u pper-level prograa is in turn carried  
prograa follow er running a prograa a t i  
le v el-- c a lle d  a aicroprograa.
F irs t of a l l ,  i t  aeans th at the upper-level 
binary language can be anything you want-- th at Is, 
any f e a sib le  coaputer language--because each of 
Its  in stru c tio n * , in turn, w ill be c arried  out by
This aeans, for Instance, that aachines can 
be created which aay be prograaaed d ir e c tly  in soae 
h ig h er-lev el language, such as A P L  (note Canadian 
aachine described on p. 2 .1 )  or BASIC (note one of 
the Hewlett-Packard aachines described on p. J7 )•
The c h arac ters in the upper-level prograa (APL or 
BASIC), stepped through by the u p p er-level prograa 
follow er, cause the low er-level prograa follow er to 
carry out the operations of the language.
Second, the aachine costs less to  aake than an 
ordinary coaputer. The reason Is th a t the arc h i­
tectu re of ordinary coaputers is designed now (at 
la st) fo r nroaraaaer convenience. Thus a aachine 
lik e the P u r - u ,  wnicIT in p rin cip le  does nothing 
any oth er coaputer doesn't do, Is s t i l l  aore d e sir­
able than n o st, because Its  In stru ctio n s are so 
well designed. I t  is clear and se n sib le  to the pro- 
g raaaer, w ith tha resu lt th a t prograaaing It takes 
less tla e  and co sts less aoney.
M icroprocessors reverse th is tren d . The lower- 
level stru c tu re  of reg isters and in stru c tio n s can be 
anything th a t is convenient to  aan u factu re, whether 
or not prograaaera lik e I t. Low  aanufacturing cost 
la one of th e B ain design c r it e r ia .
The purpose of alcroprocessors, you se e, la 
g enerally to  be hidden In oth er equlpaent and do 
som  sia p le  thing over and over; not to  have th e ir 
prograas changed around a ll the tta e  as on an o rd i­
nary coaputer.
ttiere are exceptions, coaputers which have a 
second le v el down where you can put aicro p ro g ra as; 
and these are called , sensibly enough, aicro p ro g raa-  
aable c o ap u te rs. They are bought and s e t up with 
regular coaputer accesso ries, plus f a c ilit ie s  to 
change the aicro p ro g raas. Thus they co st a lo t aore; 
but oh, they do so Mich aore for you. You can design 
your own co aputer-- i . e . ,  its  In stru c tio n -se t-- and

aeans that if  you aake a fancy bulldozer or bake-

Actually the In te l chip Is a nuaber of separate 
chips, which s ta r t low in cost-- a fairly  coopleto 
se t can be had for under $S00-- and can be asseabled 
in to  a fu ll coaputer. (Indeed, various firas do of­
fer coaplete coaputers b u ilt out of In tel ehips. In­

While these individual chips cost under a hundred

around these chips, In te l has cannily prepared a nua- 
ber of setups. If  you want to go 4 - b it, you get the 
" In tc lle c  4," {2200, which also needs a Teletype.
This gives you various display lig h ts and debugging

ing. I f you want to go 8 - b it, you get the "In tellec

B asically , an operating ays tea is  a 
prograa th a t supervises a ll tne oth er pro­
grams Ln a cooputer. For th is  reason l l  is 
also  called  a su£^rvl_sor or a n o n ito r.
Because the operating systea is supposed to 
be In charge, aany coaputers now o ffe r spe­
c ia l w ired-in in stru c tio n s th at only the 
operating sy ste a  can use. This prevents 
o th e r prograas froa taking coaplete control 
o f the aaehine.
O perating systeas cone in a ll sizes.
The bigger ones take up a lo t of coaputer 
tlo e because they have to do a lo t. The 
sa a lle s t kind,which are rea lly  kind of 
d if f e r e n t, are Just to help a sin g le  pro* 
i r i n e r  aove quickly between h is basic 
prograas. (A ty p ical such systeo is DEC's 
DOS, or Disk Operating Systea, which you 
can get w ith the PDP-11.) This sy stea is 
re a lly  a kind of b u tle r th at keeps track of 
where your b a sic  prograas are sto re d  on disk 
and brings thea in for you quickly.
A  step  up is the Batch Monitor, or op­
e ra tin g  sy ste a  se t up for Batch Processing 
(see p.&~!!>tr). In batch p rocessing, pro­
graas go through the coaputer as i f  on a 
conveyer b e lt, one a t a tin e (or in soae 
•y steas several at a tin e ) . The operating 
sy ste a  shepherds thea.
Uatch processing is used when prograas 
d o n 't need any in te rac tio n  with huaan users. 
(Or, and th is is aore coaaon, when huaan 
users want tin e -sh arin g  but c a n 't get i t ;  
see below.) A  a u ltip r oeraaalne operating 
sy stea is one that allows several d ifferen t
Erograns (o r eonveyor-belt sequences of

Then there is tia e -sh a rin g .
T ine-sharing means the siuultancous use 
of one coaputer by several d iffe re n t users 
at once. I t 's  b asically  a conplci fora of 
au ltiprogranning.
In p rin cip le  th is is like a lazy susan.
The c en tral cooputer works on one u se r's pro­
graa for a w hile, then on a n o th e r 's ... u n til 
it is back to the f i r s t  user.
There are b asically  two kinds of tia e - 
sharing: tino-sharing where you can only use 
c ertain  f a c ilit ie s  or languages, snd tiuc- 
sharing where you can use a ll the f a c ilit ie s  
of the conputer (including prograaaing in the 
computer's assembly language).
Exaaples of r e s tric te d  tia e -sh a rin g  are

Bigger Is not necessarily  b e tte r. For 
in stan ce, there are tin e-sh ared  versions of 
BASIC th at run on big IB M  coaputers. How ­

Iq the eaTly throes of coaputer epthuaiasa, 
i t  is easy to suppose th a t anything can be done 
by co aputer'- th at Is, anything Involving the 
chewing or diddling of inform ation. This Is 
decidedly not so.
For Instance, i t  Is easy enough, and often 
p r a c tic a l, to have a coaputer do soaething a few 
a lllio n  tla e s. But I t  is  a lao st never p rac tic al 
to have a cbaputer do soaething a t r i l l i o n  tlaes. 
W hy? Well, l e t 's  say (fo r the sake of sla p ll-  
c ity ) that a certain  prograa loop takes 1/1000 
of a second. To do i t  a thousand tla e s , then, 
-would take one second, and to  do I t a B illio n  
tia e s would take a thousand seconds, or about 
seventeen alnutes.. But to do i t  a t r i l l i o n  tiaes 
now, would peaa doing I t  ITjO O O jO O O a ln u te s, or 
over th irty  years.
Now, you w ill note th a t even i f  you speed uj 
th at loop to 1/1,000,000  of a second, a tr ill io n  
rep e titio n s w ill take alao at twelve days, which 
is obviously going to need soae ju s tify in g , even 
assuming that I t  Is otherwise fea sib le .
(For probleas of th is type people begin

quentially In a f in ite  aaount of tia e , and 
soae things c a n 't, such as proving c e rta in  
types of a ath eaatical theorea. In oth er words, 
anything th at has to do things in sequence-- 
whether a coaputer or a aind of God, If any-- 
cannot possibly know anything which is not 
Turing-coaputable. Another Iap o rtan t llm ita- 
tlon.
O n a aore p r a c tic a l le v e l, though, there 
are Just lots of things which nobody has fig u r­
ed out how  to do In any fea sib le  way, or are 
Just now figuring out d iffe re n t s y ste a a tic  ways 
of doing. (For a fav o rite  such area of nine, 
coapare the d iffe re n t coaputer h a lf-to n e  iaage

Thus you see th a t flg g erln g  out wavs of 
doing stu ff is s t i l l  one or the p rin cip al as­
pects 01 the coaputer fie ld . (Vnole journals 
are devoted to I t ,  such as C A C M , JA C M  and so on.)
But then of course, every few years there 
coaes a new aoveaent in  the field  th at bodes to 
aake us s ta r t a ll over.
One such trend Is c a lle d  stru c tu re d  prog­

USEFUL. AND POSSIBLY EMBARRASSING QUESTIONS
If lhe Computer Pnesls s u r t to pick on you. 
here are seme hclplul phrases that will give you 
strength.
I do not wanl to give the impression thal the 
Guardians ol the Machine arc always bad guys.
Nevertheless, sad to relale, they arc not always 
good guys. Like everyone oul 10 bolster his position, 
including the plumber and ihe electrician, Ihe compuier- 
man haa learned how easy it is to intimidate the layman.
Now. these people are often righl. Bul if
a consumer advocale or w hatever-- you are probably 
cnlitied to slrsighi answers thal will help settle the 
matter honestly . without puldowns , Any honest 
man will agree.
Now, iheae helplul questions, honesily answered, 
may elicil long mysterious answ ers. Be patienl 
and conlident. Write down w hai’s aaid and sil down 
wiih ihe glossary in this book until you understand 
the answer. Then you can ask more questions,
I am not inviting the reader to make irouble 
flippantly. 1  am suggesting lhal many people have
there may be some discomfort al first.
HOW  DOES IT WORK?
(This question may have to be backed 
up as follows: 'T here are no computer systems 
whose workings cannoi be clearly described 
to someone who understands Ihe basics, I  
INSIST THAT YOU MAKE A SINCERE ATTEMPT.- )
WHY DO YOU CLAIM IT HAS TO BE THIS W AY?
(SPEAK MORE SLOWLY , PLEASE.)
WHAT IS THE DATA STRUCTURE?
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT IN TERMS OF THE DATA 
STRUCTURE?
WHO DESIGNED THIS DATA STRUCTURE?
And can I talk 10 him?
WHAT IS THE ALGORITHM?
WHO IS THE PROGRAMMER?
And can I talk to him?
WHY DO WE HAVE TO USE A  CANNED PROGRAM FOR 
THIS?
WHY IS THE INPUT LANGUAGE SO COMPLICATED?
WHY DO WE NEED CARDS? W HY CAN'T PEOPLE TYPE 
IN THEIR OW N INPUT?
WHY NOT HAVE A  SIMPLE-MINDED FRONT END THAT 
LETS USERS CONTROL IT THEMSELVES?
WHY HAVE FORMS TO FILL OUT? WHY NOT HAVE 
A  DIALOGUE FRONT-END ON A  MINI?
WHY CAN T IT BE ON-UNE? AvJ «*. O C T J f c w k .f r  /l O  M L O '^ ) T  
W HY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THAT BRAND OF COMPUTER?
W HY NOT GET A SYSTEM WITH LESS OVERHEAD?
W HY SHOULD ALL COMPUTER OPERATIONS BE CENTRALIZED’
DON'T THEY GET IN EACH OTHER’S WAY?
WHY DOES IT ALL HAVE TO BE ON ONE COMPUTER?
WHY NOT PUT PART OF IT ON A  DEDICATED MINI?
W HY CAN’ T WE DO THIS PARTICULAR THING ALL 
ON A MINI?
WOULDN’T IT COST LESS IF WE GOT A MINICOMPUTER 
FOR THIS TASK?
W HY CAN'T THIS BE PROGRAMMED IN SOME LANGUAGE 
LIKE BASIC?
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW  THAT COMPUTERS DONY 
HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY. WHY DO YOU CHOOSE 
TO DO IT THAT W AY?
If these suggestions seem unnecessarily contentious, 
il is because m t  of these guys like to pick on people, 
and you may have is be read y . And you may need 
all the support you can gel, if. say . you lake a stand 
like one of Ihese:
*U Ihe Information is in th ere, I don't see why 
we c an't gel it out."
’ You have no right to aak questions like this, 
snd if the program requires il , change the program . *

and done graphics; lately Ihelr fad Is working wilh lhe LDS-1 
In Princeton’s Chemistry Department.
Where do Ihey learn It * 1 1 ?  They loach each other, of course. 
Newcomera hang around, learn computor lolk, work on projects, 
and (ease each olher. They Kin use the Informal trade channels, 
subscribing to magazines and filling oul Information request 
cards under such company names as Plebnay International Signal 
Division and Excallbur Wax Fruit.
The greal Ihing about these klda Is their lany flippancy .  
They've never failed, they've never beon afraid for their Jobs, 
snd so they combine the zest of lhe young wilh Ihoir cupcrtlso. 
Their forma of expression are as slanllng to professionals as 
they are lo outsiders; don't say anything ponderously If 1 1  can

They have varied backgrounds. The father of one is s butcher, 
lhe father of another is one of ihe country’9 foremost intellectuals. 
(None or thal matters to lhe k id s.) I have dined in a number ot 
their homes,  and find (his in common: Iheir parents show them 
great respect. love and trust, indeed. Resistor parents liuvc 
expressed some surprise lo learn lhat their children's work is 
al lhe full-fledged professional level. Tho Important ihing, lo 
lhe parents, ia lhal the kids are  working on constructing (hings 
they enjoy.
The iruUe press is ambivalent toward th 
the one hand they moke good copy. (Al one S| 
had the only working tim esharing demo-- on 
a phone booth .) On the other, they Ramclimes 
publicity-hungry, like many cclcbrilies.  (At anol

I first met the Resistors in 1970. aril stoned hanging around 
with them for Iwo reasons, First. Ihey arc pcrf«:lly delightful: 
enthusiastic In the way lhat most Adults forego, and very witty.
To them computer lulk was nol u thing apart, as it is fur both out­
siders and mony professionals.
Secondly, and this wos lhe self-seeking nspccl. 1  noted 
that those kids were quite expert, and interested in giving me 
advice where computer professionals would nol- They got interested 
in helping me with my (perhaps quixotic) Xuiiudu1 "1  project (see 
flip s id e). This wos enough to keep mu visiting for a vouple of 
years, Now, some people arc loo proud lo ask children for Informa­
tion. This Is dumb. Information is where you find il.
The last I heard, the Resistors were M l work in ,i COUOL 
compiler for the PDP-11. hoping il would snvc the local high school 
from lhe disastrous (lo Ihcm) purchase of an 1IIM  1130. (Since 
the school's intent was to leueh business programming, they hoped 
lhal the availability of COUOL would cnceurngc lhe school (o buy 
lhe more powerful and less expensive PDP-11.)
The Rcsislor6 «re few, bui I think (hey lire very important

Is our edifice of pedagogy , with all its scqucnccs and sterilizations, 
and how onybody cun learn unyIhing in lhe right atmosphere,

lhe languages BASIC. POHTRAN. COBOL and TRAC. "How long 
have you been programming'’" he asked in surprise. "Oh. almost 
a monlh." she said .
I was driving some Resistors around Princclon; they were 
yelling contradictory driving instructions "I demand triple re­
dundancy in the directions." I said. "Right up oheud you turn 
right right away," said a spokesman.
Since (here was a lol of exccss capacity. (he Rcsis(ors got

Pranks are an im portant b ranch of humor In the field. 
Here are some thal will giv e you a sense of it.
ZAP THE 94
One of the m eaner p ra n k s was a program  thal ran  
oir Ihe old 7094. It could fit on one card (In b in a ry ), and 
put the computer In an Inescapable loop. Unfortunately 
the usual "STOP" button w as disabled by this p rogram , 
so to stop Ihe program  one would eventually have to pull 
the big emergency button. T his burn t out all the main 
reg isters.
TIMES SQUARE LIGHTS
One of the w eird er p rogram s waa the operalo r-w ak er- 
upper somebody wrote for the 7094. It was a big  pro g ram , 
and what It did was DISPLAY ALPHABETICAL MESSAGES 
ON THE CONSOLE LIGHTS, sliding pssl like the news in 
Times Square. You pu t In this program  and followed it 
with the meeaage; the co m puter's console board would light 
up and the news would go b y . Since the lights usually 
blink In u ninteresting p a tte rn s, this was v e ry  startlin g .
This program  w as extrem ely complex. Since the 
94 displayed the contents of all main reg isters and tra p , 
arithmetic and overflow lig h ts, it was necessary to do v ery 
w eird things in the pro g ram  to tu rn  these lights on and 
off at (he right dmee.
THE TIME-WASTER
In one company, for some reason, it w as a rran g ed  
thal large and lo n g -ru n n in g  program s had prio rity  o ver 
short quick o nes. V ery well: someone w rote a counterattack 
program occuping sev eral boxes of punch c a rd s, to w hich 
you sdded the short p ro g ram  you really wanted ru n , and 
a card specifying how lo n g  you wanted ihe first p a n  of 
the program to grind befo re y o u r real one actually sta rted .
This would blink lig h ts and spin tapes Im pressively 
and lengthen the run of y o u r program  to w hatever' you w an ted .
BOMBING THE TIME-SHAAE
One of the classic bad -b o y  p ran k s la to bomb tim e­
sharin g  sysiem s-- that is . foul them up and b rin g  them to 
a halt. Many p ro g T am m era  have done this; one haa told 
me it's a w onderful w ay to get rid  of y our a g g re ssio n s.
Of co u rse, it can damage other people's work (especially 
if d isk s are bombed); and It always gets the system p ro g ram ­
m ers hopping mad, b ecauae It roeana you've defied th e ir 
authority and maybe found a hole they don't know about.
Here are a couple of exam olea.The w ay this story Is told, ona of the tim e-sharing 
system s al MIT would go down at completely m ysterious 
tim es, w ith all of core and disk  b e in g  w iped o u l. and 
the iin e p rin te r p rin tin g  out THE PHANTOM STRIKES.
For a long lime the guilty p ro g ram  could not be 
found. Finally it was discovered that the bomb waa 
h idden In an old and venerable statistics program  
p rev io u sly  believed to be completely reliab le. The 
reason the phantom d idn't always s trik e  w as that the 
Bomb p art queried  the system  clock a n d  made a pseudo­
random  decision w hether (o bomb th e system depending 
on the Instantaneous setting of th e clo ck . T his is why 
it took so long to discover; the p ro g ram  usually bided 
ils tim e and behaved p ro p erly .
A pparently thia w as the rev en g e of a d isgruntled 
p ro g ram m er, long since d ep arted . Not only that, but 
h is rev en g e was thorough: ihe Bomb p art of the program 
w as totally knitted into the rest of it. it w as a very 
im portant program  lhat had to be ru n  a lot w ilh different 
data, and no documentation ex iste d , m aking it for 
practical p urposes impossible lo ch an g e.
T h e final solution, so the ato ry  goes, was ihls: 
w h en ev er the rowdy program  had to be r u n . the rest 
o f the m schine w as cleared o r put on p ro tect, ao il ran 
and had ita fits in majealic solitude.
2. RHBOMB
T h e tim e-share at the Labs, n e v e r mind which 
L abs, kept going dow n. Mischief w as su sp ected . Mis­
chief waa verified: a program  called RHBOMB, su b ­
m itted .b y  a certain program m er with th e initials R .H ..

R .H . was spoken to sternly and il did not hap­

TSS HAS GONE DOWNA Grand Fad among computerfolk In the last couple 
of y e are has been the game of "Life," invented by John 
Horton Conway.
T he ru lb s appeared ln  the Scientific American In 
October 1970, in Martin G ard n er's games column, and the 
whole country w ent w ild . G ardner was swamped with 
resu lts (many published In F e b .  71); after a couple more 
issu es G ard aer w ashed his hands of i t , and It goea on 
in Its ow n magazine.
T he game Is a stra n g e  model of evolution, natural 
selection, quantum m echanics o r pretty much whatever 
else you want to see in it. P art of ita initial fascination 
w as that Conway d id n 't know its long-term outcomes, and 
held a contest (eventually won by a group from M IT).
T he ru les are deceptively simple: suppose you have 
a b ig  ch eckerboard. Each cell h as eight neighbors: the 
cella next to it u p , down an d  diagonally.
Time flows In the game b y  "generations." The pattern 
on the b oard in  each generaU on delerm ines the pattern 
on the b oard In the next g eneration. The game p art simply 
consists of try in g  out new p a tte rn s and seeing whal things 
result In the generations after it. Each cell Is either OCCUPIED 
or EMPTY. A cell becomes occupied (or "is b orn") if exactly 
th ree of lls neighbors w ere full In the previous g en eratio n .
A cell stays occupied if eith er two or th ree of its neighbors 
w ere occupied in the prev io u s g e n eratio n .  All oth er cells 
become empty ("d ie").
T hese ru les have the following g eneral effect: p a tte rn s 
you make will change, r e p e a t, g ro w , d laappear In w ild 
combinations.  Some p attern s move sc ro ss the screen  In 
succeeding generations (" g lid e r s " ) . O lher patterns pu lsate 
strangely and eject g liders repetitively (g ilder g u n s ) .
Some patterns c ra sh  together in ways that produce m oving 
g lider g u n s. Weird.
While the game of L ife, aa you can see from th e r u l e s . 
has nothing to do with com puters in trin sica lly . obviously 
com puters are the only way to try  out complex p attern s 
in a reasonable length of time.
But this was incredible! A program  so virulent that

One of the stranger projects of the sixties was a game  
played by the most illu striou s programmers at a w ell-know n  
place of research; the place cannot be named h e r e , nor  
the true name of the project, because funds were obtained  
through sober ch an nels, and those who approved were  
unaware of the true nature of the project, a game we shall  
call SURF1T ("SURvival of the FITtest".) Every day after  
lunch the guys would solem nly d eliver their program s and  
see who w on. It was a sort of analogy to biological evolution.  
The programs would attack each o th er, and the su rvivors  
would multiply until only one was le ft.
It worked like t h is . Core memory was divided up  
into "pens," one for each program mer, plus an area for  
the monitor.

Each program, or " a n im a lc o u ld  be loaded anywhere  
In its pen. The other program s knew the size of the pen  
but not where the animal was in it. Under supervision  
of the special m onitor, the animals could by turns bite  
into the other p e n s, meaning that the contents of core at  
several consecutive locations in the other pen was brought  
back, and changed to zero in its original p e n .
Your animal could then "digest"— that is , analyze—  
the contents bitten. Then the other animal got his turn.
If he was still alive— that i s , if the program could still  
function— it could stay in play; otherwise the animal who  
had bitten it to death could multiply itself into the other  
pen.
The winner w as the guy whose animal occupied all  
pens at the end of the r u n . If he won several times in a  
row he had to reveal how h is program worked.
As the game w ent o n , more and more sophistication  
was poured into the analytic routines, whereby the animal  
analyzed the program that w as its victim; so the programmer  
could attack better next tim e. The programs got b igger  
and b ig g e r.
Finally the game came to a c lo s e . A creature emerged  
who could not be beaten. The programmer had reinvented  
the germ . His w inning creature was aU teeth, with no  
diagnostic routines; and the first thing it did was multiply  
itself through the entirety of its own p e n , assuring that  
no matter where It might just have been bitten, it would  
survive.

For Ihe most p u l. big computer* have 
always been rented or lowed, rather than 
teught outright. Thera are various reasons (or

make* (he whole thing tax-deductible without 
amortization problems, and means lhat It's pos­
sible to change part of the package—  the model

And big amounts of money don't have lo be 
shelled out st once.
Pram the manufacturer's point of view (and 
of course we are speaking mostly of IBM). It Is 
sdvaniageous to work the leasing game for 
several reasons. Cash Inflow Is steady. The 
manufacturer is In continuous communication 
with the customer, and has his ear for change* 
and improvements costing more. Competitors 
are st a disadvantage because the Immense 
cspltal base needed lo gel Into the selllng-and- 
leaslng game makes compelltllion Impossible.
Basically, leasing raally may be thought 
of as having two parts; the sale of the computer, 
and banking a loan on It; essentially the lease 
payments are Installment payments, and the real 
profits come alter the customer has effectively 
paid the real purchase price and is still forking
Many firms olher than IBM  prefer to sell 
Ihelr computers outright. Minicomputers are 
almost always sold rather than rented. However, 
for those who believe in renting or leasing, ihe 
so-called "leasing firms" have appeared, effec­
tively performing a banking function. They buy 
the computer, you rent or lease il from them, 
and they make the money you would've saved 
If you'd bought.
IBM , now required lo sell ils computera 
as well as lease them, keeps making changes

THE SEVEN DWARVES AND THEIR FRIENDS

sround and "unbundled." meaning you had io 
buy It separately, and Ihere has been some fol­
lowing of this example. However, for U6crs who 
arc buying s computer wilh some canned program 
for s psrliculsr purpose, prices arc obviously 
for the whole package: It's people who use Ihe 
ssmi- compuier for a lot of different things lhal 
have to pay for Individual programs.
There are many smell software companies. 
For the cost of a letterhead anyone can start one; 
the question is whether he has anything special
lo sell. Some people whomp up programs on 
their own which turn out lo be quite useful.
(For Instance, one Benjamin Pitman offers a 
magnificent program In Fortran lo generate tex­
tual garbage. It's so good it can be used lo 
expand proposals by hundreds of pages. He 
calls il Simplified Integrated Modular Prose (SIMP 
and It sells for 110. His address is Compuier 
Center. University of Georgia, Athens GA 30602?)
Obviously, lo creele big systems for intri­
cate management purposes requires a great deal 
more effort. TradilionHlly these arc done by 
vast programmer teems working in COBOL or 
the like, constantly fighting with monitor program 
and chewing up millions of dollars. However,

Programs arc protected by copyright-- 
Ihal's Ihe only way there can be a software In­
dustry at all-- but aincc there has been no 
court litigation in ihe field, nobody knows what 
the law really is or wh<.t il covers. Everybody 
agrees that traditional copyright precedent covers 
a lol of ground-- "derivative works" definitely 
violate copyright, even study guides lo texlbooks- 
-- bul no one knows how far this goes.
Same for patents. The Patent Officc has 
granted program patents, notably the one on 
ihe sorting program of Applied Data Research, 
Inc.. but The Patenl Officc has a profound dis­
taste for this potential extension of ite. duties, 
a n < 1  it- telling cvi-rycnc that programs aren't 
palemablc. even though Ihcy clearly fell wilhin 
its mandate as unique, original processes.
People who only road the headlines think 
thal ihe Supreme Court struck down llic patent­
ability of programs. No such thing.
In ihis light ihe patents ihsl the Unlvereily 
of Utah has gotten on Ihc halftone image synthesis 
programs of Wamock and Wylie and Romney (sec 
p. ) are of considerable interest. These 
palcnls use the "softwarc-as-hardware" ruse: the 
program is described in detail as taking plBcc in 
a fictitious machine shown in many detailed draw­
ings whose nebulous character Is not readily 
seen by the uninitiated: events vaguely taking 
place in "mlcroprogrammablc microprocessors" 
have been neatly foiMed on the Patent Officc as 
detailed technical diaclosure. It's a great game. 
The Idea Is lhat the claims arc so drawn as lo 
eover notjusl the fictitious machine, bul any 
program tliat should happen to work the same 
way. Bul such approaches, though common to 
provtous.patent practices, have not yet been 
litigated In this field.While In principle ihcrc would seem lo be 
every advantage in buying used computers, there 
are certain drawbacks. Service is the main one: 
the manufacturer Is not very helpful about fixing 
discontinued machines, and you may have to know 
how to do it yourself. Even with machines still 
available, you may have trouble getting onto a  
scrvice contract from ihe manufacturer, since 
it "msy have been mistreated." (American Used 
Compuit-r, in Boston, will usually guarantee 
llial ils merchandise will be accepted back into 
manufacturer's contract servicc.) A  final draw­
back is price: a popular machine may cost as 
much used as new. since they're saving you the 
waiting period.
It's kind of unfortunate: olherwise usable 
machinea gel wasted. (Bul here's waste for 
you: certain well-known laboratories, owned by 
a profit-making monopoly, smash their used com­
puters if nobody wants them wilhin the lab.
They claim they can't resell them becpuse they 
would then be "competing” wilh the manufacturers.
I  wish ihe conservationists would gel on thal one.)
(Nolis front all over: il sccm6 lhat all the 
surviving numbers of the Philco compuier. a nlcc 
machine but very much discontinued, have ei­
ther gone to ihe slate of Israel or lo Pratt Insti­
tute in Brooklyn. When I  spoke at Pralt they 
showed me Iheir Philco machines, chugging hofil- 
Ihlly. and said ihey had 0 think) some four more 
Philcos in crslcs, donated by their original owners.)
ANNOUNCEM KNTS

is ihc Announcement, the statement by a company

or sell a certain computer or program. Some 
very odd things happen wilh announcements In  
ihis field. (None of (his is unique to computer­
dom, but It goes to unusual extremes here.)
Under our syslcm il is permissible for any 
person or firm lo announce lhal he will make or 
sell any particular thing, and even If he's lying 
through his leelh, it's nol ordinarily considered 
fraud unless money changes hands. Talk is 
cheap. Thus ii Is common practice In American 
industry for people to say lhat Ihcy will soon 
be selling hundred-milc-on-hour automobiles, 
tapioca-powered rockciships, anligravity bclu.
Okay. In Ihc computer world Ihc same 
thing happens. Thi strategy depends on the 
announcer's market position. The little guys 
are often bluffing wistfully, hoping someone will 
gel interested enough lo put up the money lo 
finish the project, or the like: Ihe big companies 
are often "testing Ihe water." looking lo sec 
whether there are potential cuslomcrs for whal 
they haven'i even aticmptcd lo develop. Announce­
ments by big companios alto have strategic value: 
if they announce something a smaller guy has 
ulrcady announced, lliey muy cut him off at the 
puss, even 'hough they hi.vc no intention of 
delivering. That's just one example. The anal­
ysis of IBM's announcements is s parlor game 
in (lie field. II has been alleged, for instance, 
lhal IB M  announced ils 360 compuier long befcre 
it was ready lo cul off incursions on ils cus­
tomers by oilier firms; Control Data, in a recent 
suil. alleged thal the Model 90 numbers of the 
160 were announced, and then developed, simply 
to destroy Control Dalu and ils own big fssl 
n,Lchines. These arr just examples.
Uatbmation ran several good articles on
buying compuier stuff In its Septem­
ber. IS. 1970 issue.
"Software Buying" by Howard 
Bromberg (35-40) and "Contract 
Caveals" by Robert P. Bigelow (41- 
44) are very helpful warnings about 
nol getting burned.
Another. "Project Management 
Games," by Wemer W . Leuierl (24- 
34) is an absolutely brilliant, blood­
curdling strategic analysis of the 
ploys and dangers involved in buy­
ing and selling very expensive things, 
such as computers and software.

Those of us who w ere around will n e v e r 
forget th e D ays of M adness (196B-9). Com puter 
stocks w ere boom ing, and their b u y e rs d id n 't 
know what it was about; but ev ery w h ere there 
were financial people trying to back new com­
puter com panies, and everyw here the sm art 
computer people w ho'd m issed out on G etting 
Theirs w ere looking for a deal.
Datamation for November 1969 was an inch 
thick, there w ere that many ads fo r com pulers 
and accessories.
At the Fail Joint Computer C onference th at 
year in  Las V egas, I had to cover the hig h lig h ts 
of the e x h ib its in a h u r r y , and It Look me all 
afternoon, m uch of it p ractically at a tro t. T h e n , 
after closing tim e, I found out th ere had been 
a whole other b u ild in g .
It is im portant to look at how a lot o f th ese 
companies w ere back ed , the b e tte r to u n d erstan d  
how irrationality bloomed In the sy ste m , and 
made the collapBe of the speculative stocks in 
1970 quite Inevitable.
A num ber of com panies w ere started  at 
the initiative f i t people who knew what th ey  were 
doing and had a c le a r idea, a new technique o r 
a good m arketing sla n t. T hese w ere in the 
m inority, I fear.
More common w ere com panies started  at 
the initiative of somebody who wanted to s ta rt 
"another X " -- a n o th e r m inicom puter com pany, 
another term inal com pany, expecting the pro d u ct 
somehow to be satisfacto ry  when throw n together 
by hired h e lp . P erh ap s these people saw  com­
puter com panies as som ething lik e gold m ines, 
putting out a common product w ith interchangeable 
commodity v alu e.
The d e a l, as some of these Wall S t . h a n g e rs- 
on would ex p lain  il, was most in trig u in g . T h e ir 
idea was to create a com puter company on low 
capital, " b rin g  it p ublic" (get clearance from the 
SEC to sell stock p u b lic ly ), and then make a 
killing as th e sheep bought it and the p rice w ent 
u p .  T h e n , if y ou could get a "track reco rd " 
based on a few fast sales, the in creasin g  p ric e  
of your stock (these are the days of m adness, 
rem em ber) m akes it possible to b uy up o th e r 
companies and becom e a conglom erate.It w as v e ry  difficult to  talk lo theBe people, 
ja rticu larly  if you w ere try in g  to get su p p o rt for 
a legitim ate e n te rp rise  b u ilt around un u su al ideas. 
(E verybody w ants to be seco n d . ) And w hat's 
w orse, they tended to have that most re p re h e n ­
sible quality: th ey  w ouldn’t liste n . Did they 
want to h e a r w hat y o u r id ea actually w as? "I'll 
get my technical people to evaluate it"— and 
they send o v er Joe who once took COBOL. I 
finally fig u red  out that such people a re  im possible 
to talk to if y o u 're  s in c e re — it's  a quality  they 
find unfam iliar and th reaten in g . I d o n 't think 
th e re '6 any w ay a person with a genuine idea 
can com m unicate with su ch  W heeler-D ealers; 
they just fix y ou with a piercin g  glance and say 
"Y eah, but are we talk in g  about hard w are o r 
softw are?" (the two w ords they know in  the 
fie ld ).
'ITS A WHFF1.FRr
T he jo k e r is lhal if you m issed out on all 
th is you w ere m uch b e tte r off. Anyone w ith a 
genuine idea is being set up for two Ceecings: 
the first b ig  o n e , when th ey  tell you y o u r id e a s, 
skills and lo n g -term  in d en tu re are w orth 2J%
(if y o u 're  lu ck y ) com pared lo th eir im m ense con­
trib u tio n s of " b u sin ess know how ," and lhe second, 
when you go public and the u n d e rw rite r gets 
vast rakeoffs for h is  incom parable s e rv ic e s. Whai 
is moBt likely to get lost in all this is any o rig ­
inal o r stru c tu re d  contribution to the w orld that 
the com pany was in ten d ed , in y o u r m ind, to 
achieve.T h is is  all lhe sa d d e r b ecau se lhe com­
p anies lhat achieve im portant th in g s in th is field, 
as far as I can  see, are those w ith 'a  unifying 
id ea, c a rrie d  out unslinlingly b y  the man o r 
m en who believe in it. I think of O lsen 's Digital 
E quipm ent C orporation, Data G en eral, Evans and 
Sutherland Com puter C orporation, V ector G eneral. 
T his is not to say that a good idea succeeds 
without good management o r good break s: for 
in stan ce, V iatron, a firm w hich w as the d arlin g  
of lhe com puter high-fly in g  sto ck s, had a p e r ­
fectly sound idea, if nol a deep one: to produce 
a video term inal lhat could be sold for as liltle 
as $100 a m onth. But they got overex ten d ed , 
and had m anufacturing tro u b le s, and that was 
that. (You can now gel a  video term inal for 
$49 a m onlh, lh e H azeltine.) Of c o u rse , a lol

T h is is  still a field w h e re  in d iv id u als can

‘IBM,* ■ ■  everyone knows, is the trade 
mark of tha International Budns** Machines 
Corporation, an Immanta company cent*rod in 
Armonk. N.Y., bul Extending to over t  hundred 
countries and amploylng vail over a quarter of 
a million people.
IBM  dtanlnstes two Induitrlas. computers 
and a lac trie typewriters.
To many people. IB M  ta synonymous with 
computers. Some ol the public. Indeed, believes 
them to be the only coaputer manufacturer.
In cameras and film. Uiere Is Kodak. In 
automobiles. there I* General Motors. And In 
the computer field there l( IBM.
IBM  sella some 65 to 7 0 %  of all lha com­
puters and programs that sre sold. In thla res­
pect. the balanced near-monopoly, Ihay are like 
Kodak and CM.
But there are Important differences. Ev- 
everybody knows what a camsra 1b. or an auto­
mobile. But to many,  If not moat, people, a 
computer la what IBM  say* II Is.
The Importsncs of Ihls firm, for good or 
HI. cannot be overstated: whose legend 1*  so 
thick, whose stock prices have doubled and re­
doubled, ten Lim es over, to Us mulliblllion-dollsr 
mass: whose leaning Infallibility-- at least, as 
seen by outsiders-- have been the stuff of 
legend, whose style has proliferated across the 
world, a style which has In a way Itself become 
synonymous with 'computers:* whose name aym- 
bollies for many people—  remarkably, both 
those who love It and those who hate It-- the 
New Age.
The rigidity associated In the public mind 
with "the computer* may be related In some 
deep way to thla organization. As a corporation 
they are used to designing systems that people 
have to uae In Ihelr joba by flat, and thus there 
are few external limitations on the compiles Ilona 
to our lives that IB M  can create.
Many ptnple mistake IB M  for "]ual another 
big company.’ and here lies the dsnger. IBM's 
position In the world Is so extraordinary, go 
carefully poised (aa a result of various anti­
trust proceedings snd precsutiona) Just outside 
of total monopoly of a vitally important snd all- 
penetrating field, that much of what they do has 
Implications for all of us. Ralph Nader's con­
tention that General Motors Is too powerful to 
function as an independent government surely 
applies even more to IBM.  General Motora is not 
in a position to persuade the public thsl every 
car has Id have ten wheals and a snowplow.
IB M  m a il in sane wsys to hive molded compu­
ters in l u  own image, and then persuaded tha 
world that thla la the way they have to be.
But IBM la deeply sensitive, in Its way. 
to public relations, and has woven an extensive 
ayatam of political ties and legends (if not 
mythology) which have kept 1 1 almost completely 
aaempt from the critical attention of concerned 
citizens.
Thus It i t necessary here, simply as a 
matter of rove ring the field al an Introductory 
level, to raise some questions and criticism* 
that occur to pwple who are concerned about 
IBM. IBM  presumably will nol mind having 
these matters raised; their public-aplrlted con­
cern in so many areas assures lhat when some- 
UUng so publicly important as the character of 
their own power la concerned, occasional 
scrutiny ahould be welcane.ll is Important to note Brat of all thal IB M  
is In many respects the very model of a gener­
ous and dutiful corporate citiien. In ’ammun­
ity relatione.* In donations to colleges snd uni­
versities. In generous release of the time of Its 
onployees for charitable and civic undertakings. 
It Is almost certainly the most pub lie-spirited 
corporation in America, snd perhaps on the 
face of the earth.
They have been generous about many 
public Interest projects, from Braille transcrip­
tion lo donating photographers snd facilities for 
films on child development.
The corporation sponsors worthwhile cul­
tural events, "Don Quixote" wilh Hex Hsrrlson 
on TV was terrific, Katharine Hepburn's "Glass 
Menagerie* was marvelous.
IBM's enlightenment snd benevolence 
toward its employees le perhaps beyond that of 
any company anywhere. They have rigorously 
upgraded the position of women snd olher minor­
ity employees; the opportunities for women may 
be greater there than anywhere elae, They have 
upgraded repair of their eyelems. at any level, 
to white-collar status, and tool kite are disguised 
as briefcases. This innovation, making a repair­
man inlo a "field engineer," Is one of the clever­
est publlc-relallons snd employment policies aver 
Instituted.
They are openhanded 10 stnployeea who 
wanl to run for office, evidently regardless of 
platform. In the alines there were peace candi­
dates who worked for IBM . and evidently got 
lime off for 1 1 . More recently. Fran Youngsieln. 
an IBM  marketing Instructor, was a 1973 candi­
date for Mayor of New York on the ticket of the 
Free Libertarian Party, opposing all laws againal 
victim lesa crimes (e.g. prostitution and odd sex), 
as wall aa Day Care and welfare.T H €  g o oJ > A M ) M cw r

They offer many computer pro- These programs ate not necessarily 
grams (or a variety of purposes. set up the way you would want them.
(Bul If you take the trouble to adapt 
to them, you'll probably never get 
beck.)
The programs favor card or 
card-like Input and. to dala. strongly 
discourage time-sharing snd widespread 
convenient terminal use by untrained 
people.
IBM  programs are also notoriously 
Inefficient. (Thai way you have to use 
bigger machines for longer.)
A  company or governmental agency The courses Indoctrinate with the IB M  
can get Immense amounts of *help* outlook, and the planted people spread 
and ■Information" from IBM, which ll. Moreover, both mechanisms help 
offers free courses, even IB M  IBM  spot the people they can work with 
people on "released time" lo look to make a big aale- - and (it ie alleged 
over the problems on the premises. by some) those who stand In the way.
IB M  offers varioua kinds of com­
patibility among Its systems. It always seems to cnat extra.
IBM  equipment Is rugged and 
durable, and their repairmen 
or 'field engineers" struggle 
with greet diligence and alacrity
to keep It running. You may not like the way il runs.
They also rarely fire people. Once you're 
in, and within certain broad outlines, it's ex­
tremely sale employment. For those who turn 
out not lo fit in well, they have a tradition of 
certain gentle presaure-practices like moving 
you around tha country repeatedly at IBM  ex­
pense. This encourages leaving, bul also ex­
poses the lets-wanted employee lo a variety of 
opportunities he might nol otherwise see. without 
the trauma and anxiety of dismissal.
(II la said thai there are IBM  flrlngB, but 
they are rare and formidable. Hey wood Gould's 
description of an IB M  firing (Corporation Freak,  
pp. 113-115). for which he does not claim au­
thenticity, Is nevertheless bloodcurdling.)
IBM's Inlernetlonel manners (In lls 115 
countries) are likewise prBiseworlhy. Compared 
to the perfidious behavior of some ol our other 
multinational corporations, they are sweetness 
and light and hlghschool civics. Sensitive to 
the feelings of people abroad, ihay are Bald to 
operate carefully within arrangements made to 
satisfy each country. They train nationals for 
real corporate responsibility rather lhan bringing 
in only outside people. And they are sensitive 
to issuea: for Instance, they recently refused to 
eel up an Aptrtheid computer in South Africa.
ONE THING IS PERFECTLY CLEAR:
IB M  haa no monopoly on understanding or sophistication,
THEN W H Y  SUCH A  RANGE OF FEELINGS 
TOW ARD IB M ?
Among computer people, feelings toward 
IBM  range from worship lo furious hale (depen­
ding only In part on whether you work there).
Many, many are of course employed by 
IBM. and the davotlon with which they embrace 
the corporation and lls spirit ie a wonder of the 
world.
But the spiritual community of IBM  extends 
further. (Jpper-managemeni typos, especially 
Chairmen of Boards and compiroJIers, seem to 
have a reverence (or IB M  thal ia not of this 
world, some amalgamated vision which entwines 
Images of eternal stock and dividend growlh 
with an ideellted nodon of management efficiency.
Many others use and live with IBM's equipment, 
and view IB M  as anything from "the grealest 
company In the world’ lo "a fact of life" or even 
"a necessary evil." In some places whole colo­
nies of users mold themselves in lls image, so 
lhal around IB M  computers there are many "lltile 
IBMs." full of people who Imitate the personali­
ties and style of IB M  people. (RCA. before its 
computer operation (all to pieces. Imitated not 
Juat the design of IBM's 380 computer, but a 
whole range of titles and departmental names 
from out of IBM . Tho sincereet form of flattery.)
But outside ihls pale-- beyond the spiri­
tual community of IBM-- there are quite a few 
olher computer people. Some simply ignore IBM. 
being concerned with their own stuff. Some 
like IBM  but happen to be elsewhere. Others 
dislike or hale IB M  (or a variety of reasons, 
business and social. And thia smoldering 
hatred Is surely far different In character from 
anybody's attitude toward Kodak or CM.
While It is nol the intent here to do any 
kind of an anti-IBM number, it Is nevertheless 
necessary to attempt to round oul Ihe one-aided 
picture lhal Is projected outside Ihe computer 
world. In what follows there ia no room to try 
to give a balanced picture. Because IBM  can 
speak (or Itself, and does so with many voices,
It Is mere Important lo Indicate here the kinds 
of criticisms which are commonly made ol IB M  
by sophisticated people within Ihe indusiry. b o 
lhat IBM-worshipers will have some Idea ol what 
bothers people. Bul of course no attempt can 
be made here to Judge these matters: Ihls Is 
Jusl intended ae source material fo T  concerned 
citizens.1. SOCIAL ASPECTS OF IB M  .
It is perhaps In the social realm. Including 
its Ideological character. lhal a lot of people 
are turned off by IBM.
IBM  has traditionally been the paternalistic 
corporation. (Paternalistic corporations were 
some kind of big philosophical Issue lo people 
In lhe fifties, but nobody cares anymore. Anyway, 
lhe rest were perhaps Inconsequential compared 
to IBM,) Big IBM  towns not only have a Country 
Club (no booze). but a Homestead for the comfort 
of important corporate guests. There are dresa 
codes (allhough non-whito shirts and below-the- 
collar hair are now allowed). and yes. codes 
of private behsvior (now subdued) .  These Irritate 
people with liberlarian concerns. They do nol 
bother employees, evidently, because employees 
knew whai they were getting Into.
Generalizations about IBM  people obviously 
cannot be very strong. Obviously there Is going 
to be immense variation among 2E5.000 people. 
half of whom have college degrees: bul of course 
one of lhe great truths of sociology Is lhal any 
non-random group haB  tendencies.
More than thal In IhiB case. In a way IB M  
people are an ethnic group. Impressive indeed 
are lhe general energy and slnglemindedness 
of the people, galvanized by Ihelr certainty that 
IBM  is true, good and right, and lhat the IB M  
way is lhe way.  This righteousness Is of course 
a big turn-off for a lol of people.  Perhaps 1 1  
leads In turn to the most-heard slurs about IB M  
people, lhat they are bralnwsBhed or provincial.

PROVINCIAL?
There would aa«n to be no quaMlon that 
IB M  people are comparatively conservative and 
convantlHial. Thl* partly because ihai'e who IB M  
hire* (though they reportedly urge tolerance ol 
the unusual employee In a training Ola, 'The W ild 
Duek"). A huge number of IBH people never 
worked for anybody elee: obviously thia affects 
the perspective. like etaylng at one university 
all your life, or In one city.
II aay aleo be that becauee IB M  place* u c h  
a premium on dependability and obedience, new 
ideas (and (be abilities needed to generate them) 
naturally run Into a little trouble.  Some critics 
llod among IBM  people e heavy concern with con* 
vantiatal symbols td achievement, and (unfor­
tunately) eating tha world etuck all over with 
conventional labels and Middle American stereo*
S u e  of the m a t amuelng material on thle 
o n e *  from an odd source: e writer named 
Haywood Could wbo, all unprepared, bocame a 
consultant to IBH. earned unconscionable amount* 
of money (M0.000 in six months). and lived lo 
write a very funny and observant book about It 
(see Bibliography).
But 1 1  le necessary on thsse matters to tee 
bow difficult things can be lor IBH pvple. To be 
Identified ts an IBM  parson is soaething like wear* 
Ing a ring Id your nose, a yarmulkaor a halo: 
an enirapmsnt In a social role lhat makes ths Indi­
vidual^ position ewkward among outsider!. IB M  
pople often have to take guff it parlies, unless 
Ihsy are IBM  parties. Defenslvsnss* nay account 
for some of the Overdo, and some of the dannlsh-
BHAIN W ASHSD?
II I* true that IB M  people are essentially In 
their own world, One theory Is thit comparl- 
aenuiliatlon within the firm (rather vlelble in 
tbair deslgne) may tend lo stifle. Indeed, because 
IB M  people can expect lo be briefed and schooled 
in every technical natter they will need to know 
for a given aselgnment. Ihe incentive to follow 
technical development through oulslde magazines 
and societies may be reduced. Between Think 
magaslne and corporals briefings, it Is possible 
for IB M  pwpls to be comparatively (or even com­

II i9 IBM's alleged misbehavior in pursuit 
of sales that has drswn some of the strongest 
criticism within the industry, as well as consid­
erable litigation, Their "predsiory pricing*
(a terro used by the judge In the recent Telex 
decision), and olher mean practices, are (whe­
ther true or false) folklore within the industry,
These accusations are well summsrited 
by "Anonymous” In a recent arUcle (see Biblio­
graphy). Basically Ihe accusations agalnal 
IBM's sales praciices are that they play dirty:
If you, say, the computer manager in b  business 
firm, wanl to buy equipment from Bnother out­
fit. IB M  (so the story goes) will go over your 
head to your boss, accuse you o( incompetence, 
try to get you fired if you oppose them, and 
Heaven knows whal else. Anonymous claims 
lhal various forms of threat, Intimidation, "hard­
sell scare tactics" snd "behind-the-scenes man­
ipulation'’  are actually Blandard practice in IB M  
sales: he or she alleges various insiancos in 
certsin municipalities.
Such behsvlor is emphatically denied, 
though not in relation lo thBt article, by Board 
Chairman Cary. In a recent teller lo Newsweek 
(see Bibliography). Cary emphasizes the impor­
tance of IBM's 76-psge business Conducl Guide­
lines. Whether these are publicly examinable 
is not stated.
These charges were also taken up con­
cretely in a recent survey ol computing managers 
done by UalamBlion (summarited by McLaughlin 
in "Monopoly Is Nol a Came:’ see Bibliography). 
In Datamation'* analysis oi this survey, the 
menegera did not seem to agree wilh these 
charges against IBM . However, il must be 
noted-- snd ihis seriously calls into question 
the entire survey as analyzed-- thst oul of 1100 
panelists lo the questionnaire. Datamation only 
considered 389 responses "usable." partly (It is 
ststed) because many did nol give dais allowing 
themselves to be identified, Considering the 
widespread fear of I8M  in Ihe field, ihls may 
have strongly biased the poll in favor ol IB M"When we went from IB M  to 
National C u h  Register. II was like 
Ihe difference between nlghl and day."

(Incidentally. II is amusing to note thal 
even In Ihis remaining company, in lorm* of 
"performance per dollar." the managers surveyed 
(and surviving Ihe weedoul) ranked the lop 
three companies as DEC, Burroughs end Control 
Uata. IB M  was worst oul ol 8. Obviously 
service counts for e lot.)
An Interesting view on IBM's sales ethics 
was expressed recently by Ryal R. Poppa, 
president of Pertec Corp.
"In Ihe past, when Ihere have been sslee 
situations where 'you can't honor the 
policy and win the desl.' IB M  has violated 
the policy with the practice, he said."
However, he believes thal situation Is changing 
under IBM's new management, so that Ihe guide­
lines will be observed in the luture. ("Poppa 
Seea Several IB M  Changes." Computerworld,
21 Nov 73. 29.)
The people who lake these mailers ol IB M  
sales practices most seriously** IBM's competi­
tors-- now have their own organization, the 
Computer Industry Association. This Is an asso­
ciation of computer companies, which has as 
ils intention ihe "establishment and preservation 
of a sound and viable U-S. computer industry,  
based o n ... free and open competition." Empha­
sis theirs. Translation: ihey're out lo gel IBM .

3. TECHNICAL DECISIONS A N D  DESIGNS
A. Prologue.
Part of the mylh of lOM's corporate perfec­
tion 1s based on ihe notion ihsl technical mailers 
somehow predominate In IBM's decisions, and 
thal IBM's product offerings and designa thus 
emerge naturally and necessarily and inevitably 
from these considerations. Thia is rather lar 
from the Irulh.
IB M  presents many d( Ihelr actions as tsch- 
nical, even as technical breakthroughs, whon 
in lact they are strategic maneuvers. The an­
nouncement ol a new computer, for example, 
such as the 360 or 370. is usually made to 
sound as if they have invented something special, 
while in (act they have simply made certain 
decisions as to "which way they intend lo go" 
and how they plan to market things in ihe next
W d P M n o L

IB M  conirole the Industry principally by 
controlling Its customers. Through varioua 
mechanisms, ii seems lo enforce ihe principle 
that "Once an IB M  customer, always an IB M  
customer .* With an eatraordlnary degree of 
control, surely poseeeeed In no olher field by 
any other organize Hon In Ihe free world, 1 1  
dictates whal Ils customers may buy. and whal 
they may do with what they get. More than 
this: the elections of loyalty levied upon IBM ’s 
cueumers are similar. In kind and degree, U 
whai u damande of Ils own employees. IB M  
makes the cusumer's employees more and more 
like Ils own employees, committing iheo as 
Individuals, and eOectively committing the coo- 
pany lhat buys frno It. to IBM  service In 
perpetuity.
Hare are some of the ways thle syston of 
control sem e to work. He are not saying here 
thal this Is necessarily how IB M  plans It: 
rather, these are the virtual mechanics, virtual
1 0  lha old sense: this is how it might as well 
be working. In Ihe anthropological sense this 
Is i 'functional* analysis, showing the tie-ins 
rather than Ihs actual detailed thought processes 
lhal occur. And even If Iheee ere really the 
mechanics, perhaps IBM doeen't mean them to be.
1 1  alght Just somehow be a continuous accident.
A. Interconnection and compatibilities.
IBH acts ss If It does not wanl competitors 
to be able lo connect ihelr acceeaorles id Its 
ccmputers. Ii's ss though CM  could design the 
roede so as lo prevent Ihe peesage of olher 
vebleles than lia own.
Thia la done esveral ways. First. IB M  
has soBsOmss used contractual techniques to 
prevent such intarconnecllone u  lu  ayatasa, 
either forbidding ether things to be attached 
(or al least clapping on extra service charges 
if they are). or declaring lhat ll would not 
be responsible for overall performance of such 
t  setup, effectively withdrawing the hardware
I liar anise lhat le such a strong selling point.
Secondly. IBM  doee not tall all lhat neede
lo b fe known In order to make Iheee intercon­
nection*-- ihe deUUa of the hardware interfaces.
-Finally. IBM  can simply decree, perbape 
claiming technical necessity, thst Interconnection 
la impossible. For Instance. IBH said for a 
time thal their latest big program. "VS.* or 
Virtual SysjBB, wouldn't work (translation: 
would not be allowed) If competitive memories 
were used, on the computer.Now, there are many manulacturers who 
think Ihls Is very wrong o( IBM : who beliove 
they should have ihe right to sell accessories 
and pans-- especially core and disk memorieB--
lo plug onto IBM's computers, ll has been 
generally possible lor these other manufacturers
lo work IheBe Interconnections oul awhile after 
Ihe computer comes out on Ihe market, bul 
it's gelling more difficult.
Thus tha Telex Decision of September 17. 
1S73. in which II was decreed by ihe judge that 
IB M  would have to aupply complete interlace 
information promptly when Introducing a new 
computer, was s source of great Jubilation in 
Ihe computer field. However, lhal pari of the 
Judgment has since been cancelled.
Much the same problem exists in ihs solt- 
ware area. IBM  Is less than interested In 
hslplng ils competitors write programa lhal hook 
up lo IB M  programs, to the details of program 
hookup are not alwsys made clear. Here. too. 
many smaller companies Insist thsy should be 
made to do It'.
B. Control and guidance of what the customer 
can get.
To e remarkable degree, if you are an 
fB M  cusiomsr, you practically have to buy whst 
they tell you. This IB M  manages by an intri­
cate system of fluctuating degrees of salea and 
support and contractual dealing. The IB M  cus­
tomer alwsys has several optlone: but these are 
like forced cards. IB M  is alwsys Introducing 
and discontinuing products, and changing prices 
snd contractual errangoienl* and aofiwere op­
tions in an elaborate choreography, which applies 
calculated pressures on the customer.  IB M  has 
s finely-tuned system of customer incentives by 
which il controls product phsslng. to uae the 
pollle term, or planned obsolescence, as some 
people call It.
(Ryal R. Poppa, president of Pertec Corp.. 
predicts lhal IBM  cuitomere will now be re­
quired to switch over to new products every 
five or six years, rather than every seven, 
which Poppa contende haa been the figure. 
("Poppa Sees Several IB M  Change*," Computer- 
world,  2 1  Nov 73. 28.)
Programs, especially, are available wilh 
different degrees of approval fr<m IBM. The 
technique of "support* Is the concrete manifes­
tation of approval. A  supported program le 
one which IB M  promise* to fli when bugs turn 
up. W ith an unaupported program, you're on 
your own, Cod has forgotten you. Becauee so 
much of IBM's virtue lies in the strength and 
fervor of its aupport, the uee ol unsupported 
programs, or unsupported features of supported 
programs, is a difflcull and risky mailsr. like 
driving without a map and a epare tire, or even 
going Into the Himalayas without gloves. Effec­
tively ihe withdrawal of support le the death 
knell of any big program, such as TSS/360. 
even though cueimere may wanl lo go on usingAvailability of products is in general a 
metier ol exquisite dcgrac. It's nol so much 
thai you csn or can'l gel a particular thing, 
bul thal Ihe pricing and available contracts al 
a given time ^xerl 6lrong pressure to pul you 
whero they have chosen wilhin their currently 
featured product line. Moreover, extremely 
strong hints are Biways available: the salesmsn 
will tell you whal model of Ihelr computers is 
likaly lo be a dead end. or. on the other hand, 
whet model Is likely lo offer various options 
and progressive developments in the near future.
Some things sre hall-available, eilhor ss 
"RPQs" (an IB M  term for special orders-- 
Hequeet Price Quotation), or available lo 
sophisticated customers al IBM's discretion.
With all the degrees of availability. II Is 
easy for IB M  to open or close by degrees 
various avenues in which customsrB are inter­
ested .
Also, different sizes of conputer wilt or 
won't allow given programs or desirable program 
features. Many IB M  cuatomers have io get bigger 
computers lhan ihsy would otherwise want be- 
csuse a given program-- for instance, a COBOL 
compiler with certain capabilities-- is not offered 
by tBM  for the amaller machine. Indeed, an 
elaborate sizing scheme exists for matching the 
machine to the customsr-- or. s cynic might say, 
assuring lhai you can't get the program features 
you ought lo be able to get unlesB you gel b  
larger compuier than you wanted.
What It boils down to Is that you. ihe 
customer, have few genuine options, especially 
if your firm Is already committed to doing cer­
tain things with e compuier. And when IB M  
brings out a new computer, the prlcee and 
other Influencea are exaciingly calculated lo 
make mandatory the Jump they have in mind to 
the new model.
(This planning oi customer transitions 
does nol always work. When the 370 was intro­
duced. for Instance. IB M  had In mind lhal com­
panies with a certain size of 360 would trade up 
to a bigger 370. In some cases users traded 
down to a amaller 370. which was able to do the 
same work for lees money, to the acule bother 
of IBM.)
C. Having to do things )usl Ihelr way,
IB M  sysiems and programs are set up lo 
do things In perticular ways. To a remarkable 
degree, it Is difficult io use them In ways not 
planned or approved by IBM. and difflcull to 
tie systems end programs together. Programs 
and features which ihe casual observer would 
suppose ought io be compatible, lend not to be. 
For some reason compatibility always lends to 
cost extra. II Is ss though Ihe compatibility of 
equipment end programs were planned by IB M  
as much as Ihelr product line.Elleclively the IB M  customer lends to be 
frequently trapped In a cage of restrictions, 
whether this cage is intentionally created by 
IB M  or not One is reminded of Ihe mollo of 
T.ll. white's anthill in The Once and Future King:
THAT W H IC H  IS NOT FOROlDDLN IS COM PULSORY.
The degree to which these restrictions are 
manipulated or intentional Is. ol course, a mailer 
of debate.
I). Captive bureaucracies running in place?
Perhaps the most unfortunate Ihlng about 
IB M  (from an outsider's point o( view) is ihsl 
effectively their systems can only be used by 
bureaucracies whom ihey have trained. From 
koypunch operator up lo installation manager, 
all are elleclively enslaved to curious complex­
ities thal keep changing. The ever-chsnglng 
structure of OS. and Ils quaint access methods.
Is Just one example. II might even seem lo ihe 
oulslde observer lhal IBM's gems, Intentional 
or not. is to keep things difficult and intricately 
fluid io retain utter control. In other words,
ll Is as though they fostered s continual turnover 
ol unnecessary complications to keep a cspllve 
bureaucracy running In place. People who they 
have indoctrinated lend nol io buy opponents' 
computers. People who are Immersed in Ihe 
peculiarities of IB M  sysisms. and busy keeping 
up with mandatory changes, do not get uppity. 
They are too busy, and the Inveatment of ihelr 
time and effort is too high for them io went to
Anti-IBM cynics say lhat a lot ol Ihe 
work Involved in working with IB M  computers 
Is self'generated. arising from the unnecessary 
complexities ol OS/360. JCL. TCAM  and so on. 
Bul of course lhal cannot bo evaluated here.
PROSPECTS
Theae remarks ahould clarify ihe bleakness 
of the prospect for mBn's luture among computers 
If IBM's system of control really does work this 
way, and if it is going to go on doing so. Be­
cause it means Ihe future that some of us hope 
for-- the simple and cbbubI availability io indi­
viduals of cleBr and simple computer systems 
with extraneous complications edited sway-- may 
be forecloaed II they can help It.
Lei's all hope. then. Ihsl these things 
turn out not lo be really true.
" ... IB M  In Its Infinite wisdom 
has decreed lhal Ihle is Ihe way 
we must go."

An Interesting example ol an IBM  non- 
hroakthrough v u  lhe dramatic announcement In 
1984 of tho 380 computer, |»rtrayed aa a machine 
which would at last can bine the function# of 
both "buBlness" cam pa tars and "scientiflc" com­
puters. But other companies. such aa Burroughs 
(with tha 5500 ) had been doing thla for some 
Mm. The quaint separation o( power* between 
scientific computers (with all-binary itnrage of 
number#) and bualneaa ccmputBm (decimal 
■tcrage) wat baaed only on tradition and mar­
keting consideration*, and waa otherwise unde­
sirable. in amalgamating the "two type*." IBM  
was only rescinding their own previous un- 
n «eesary distinction. The drama of the an ­
nouncement derived In large measure from the 
stress ihey had previously laid on the division, 
(Fortune ran an Interesting piece on the decision 
struggles precwling tha Introduction of the 360 
CtDputer, and the Internal arguments as to whe­
ther there should be one line of Mxnputers or two. 
See the flve-bllllon-dollar gamble piece. Biblio­
graphy.)
Thl* tie* in closely with another Interea­
ting aspect of the IBM  image, the public notion 
that IBM  la a great innovator, bringing oul 
novel technologies all ihe time. It is well known 
In the field that they are not: IBM  usually does not 
bring out a new type of product until aoma olher 
axnpany haa pioneered it. (Again remember 
the earlier point, lhat the product offering Is a 
atrateglc maneuver.) But of course such facta 
do not appear in lhe promotional literature, nor 
are they volunteered by the salesman.
The expresalon for thla In the field ia 
thst IBM  ’make* things respectable.* That la, 
customers gel thal reassured leallng, when IB M  
adds other people's innovation* to ihelr product 
Ilna. and decide Il's okay to go ahead and rent 
or buy auch a product. (Thia aleo sometimes 
kick* buslneas back to the original manufacturer.)
A few examples of things that were already 
on the market when IBM  brought them out, often 
making them sound completely new: irsnalstorUed 
compulers (first offered by Fhilco). virtual mem­
ory (Burroughs),  microprogramming (Introduced 
com mere [ally by Bunker-Ramo) .
This Is not to say thst IB M  ie Incapable of 
Innovation: merely lhal Ihey are never In a 
hurry about it. The Introduction ol IBM  pro­
ducts 1a orchestrated like a military campaign, 
and what IBM  brings oul is always s carefully- 
planned. profit-oriented step Intended not lo 
dislocate it* product line. This Is not to say 
that they don'l have new stuff in the back room, 
a potential arsenal of surprises of many types,
But ll Is probable that most ol them will never 
be seen. This Is because of IBM's "Impact1 ' 
problem.
Unique In IBM's position is the problem of 
filling new products into the market alongside 
Its old ones. Its problem Is much worse, say, 
than thal of Procter 6 Gamble. The problem is 
not merely ita site and Lhe diversity of Its 
products, but the (set Lhat they may interfere 
wilh each other (‘ impact" each other, they say) 
In very conpllcaied ways, A program like 
their Datalexl, for example, which allows cer­
tain kinds of text input and revision from ter- 
mlnaia, may affect Its typewriter Una, These 
are no small matters: the danger Is thal some 
new combination of products will gave the cus­
tomers money IBM  would otherwise be gening, 
innovstlons must expand the amount IBM  la 
taking In. or IB M  loses by making them.
These complications of the product line 
in a way provide a counterbalance to IBM's fear­
some power. The corporation haa an immense 
Inertia based on lla existing product line and 
cuBtmar baae. and on ways of thinking which 
have been carefully promulgated and explained 
throughout ita huge ranks, that cannot be 
revlaed quickly or flippantly.
Nevertheleaa it la remarkable how at 
every turn—  noUbly when people think IBM  
will be sat back-- they manage L o  make policy 
decision* or strategic moves which further con­
solidate their position. Often these seem to 
involve restricting lhe way their conputers will 
be used (see boa. "IBM's Control.')
(The most Ironic such countermove by IBM  
occurred a few years ago with the ao-called 
■unbundling" declaion. IBM  at last agreed (on 
nanplalnt (ram other software firms) lo stop 
giving lia programs away to people renting the 
hardware. Glee was widespread In the lndualry. 
which expected IBM  to lower conputer prices 
in proportion to whai 1 1 would now charge for 
the software.  M o t at a ll.  IB M  lowered Ita « m - 
putar prices by a minuscule amount and slapped 
heavy new pricea on the software-- often 
charges of thousands of dollars per month.)
A  persistant rumor Is that IBM fires 
all Ita salesmen In a geographic 
area if a key or prestige sale ia 
'loai.• as when M .I.T .'s Project 
M A C  switched over to General Electric 
em putars in the sixties, or when 
Western Electric Engineering Research 
Center passed over IBM computers 
to get s big PDP-10.
Much aa some people would like 
to believe these stories, there seems
lo be no documentation.  You would 
think one auch victim would write 
an article about It U  ll were true. _ _jFinally, Ihere Is the popular doctrine of 
IBM's infallibility. This, mo. is a ways from 
the truth. The most conspicuous example waa 
something called TSS/360.
TSS/300 was s time-sharing systan-- 
that ia. the control program to govern one 
model of the 350 as a time-sharing computer. 
According to Datamation (’IB M  Phases Out Work 
on Showcase TSS Effort.' Sept. 1, 1971, 56-9). 
over 400 people worked on It at once for a total 
of some 2000 man-years of effort. And It was 
scrapped, a writeoff of some 100 million dollara 
In lost development costs. Tha system never 
worked well enough. Reputedly users had to 
wait much too long for the computer's responses, 
and the system could not really compete with 
those offered elsewhere.
The failure and abandonment of this pro­
gram is thus responsible for IBM's present non­
competitive position In time-sharing; customers 
are now assured by IBM  that other things are 
more Important. IBM-haters thank their stars 
that thla happened.  Cynics think it conceivable 
that hlgh-power time-sharing was dropped by 
IB M  in order to shoo Its customer base toward 
areas It controlled more completely.
Two other conspicuous IBM  catastrophes 
have been specific computers: the 360 model 90 
in the lste sixties, and a machine called the 
STRETCH Bomewhat earlier. Both of these 
machines worked and were delivered to cus- 
Itaners. (Indeed, the STRETCH Is said by some 
to have been one of the best machines ever,)
But they were discontinued by IB M  ae not suf­
ficiently profitable.  Therein la said to have 
been tho "failure." (However. It has bean al­
leged In court cases that these wars ’knockout" 
machines designed to clobber the competition 
at a planned loss.)
B. Negative views of IBM  systems.
In the technical realm. IB M  Is widely un­
loved because many people think some or all of 
their computers and programs are either poor, 
or far from what they should be, The reasons
Sane ol the people feeling this way are 
IBM  customers, and for a time they had an or­
ganized lobby, called SHARE (which also facil­
itated sharing of programs). Recently, however, 
SHARE has become IBM-domlnaled,  a sort of 
company union, according to my sources.
The design of the 380, while widely ac­
cepted as a fact of life. Is sharply criticized 
by many. (See "What's wrong with the 3807",
P- 11-)
IBM's programs, while they are available 
for a broad variety of purposes, are often notor­
iously cumbersome, awkward and Inefficient, 
and sometimes dovetail very badly. However, 
tha less efficient a program la. the more money 
they make Irom it. A program lhal has lo be 
run for an hour generates twice as much revenue 
than if Ii did ils work in thirty minutes: a pro­
gram that has to be run on a computer with, say. 
a million spaces of core memory generates ten 
times the revenue it would in two hundred thou­
sand ,
The complex training and restrictions 
that go with IB M  programs seem to have 
interesting functions. (See box, "IBM's Control.")
C. Theories of IBM  design.
The question le. how could a company 
like IBM  create anything like the 380 (with its 
severe deficiencies) and lls operating system or 
control program OS (with Its sprawling compli­
cations. not present In competitors' systems)? 
Three snswers are widely proposed: On Purpose 
(the conspiracy theory),  By Accident (the 
blunder th m ry ), and That's How They're Sat 
Up (the Management Science theory). Theae 
views are by no means mutually exclusive,
The Management Science theory of IBM  
design is the only one of ihese we need take up.
The extensive use of group discussion and 
committee decisions may lend lo create awkward 
design compromises with a certain intrinsic 
aimlessness, rather than incisively distinct and 
simple structures. (See Gould's marvelous 
chapter. ’The Meeting.' 58-80.)
Their use of immense teams m do big 
programming jobs, rather than highly motivated 
and especially talented groups, is widely viewed 
ae counterproductive. For Instance. Barnet A. 
Wolf/,  in a letter to Datamation (Sept. 1, 1971. 
p. 13) says a particular program
"remaina inefficient, probably because of
IBM's unfortunate habit of using trainees
fresh out of school to write their
systems code.*
There may aleo be something in the way that 
projects are Initiated and laid out from Ihe top 
down, rather than acquiring direction from 
knowledgeable people at the technical level, 
that creates a tendency toward perfunctorlness 
and clunky structure.
Thus there may very well be no iniantional 
policy of unnecessary complication (see Box. 
"IBM's Control"). But the way in which goals 
are eel and technical decisions delegated may 
generate this unnecessary complication.QUKJnt HISW.1  
o f
IB M  appeared In 1911 aa the con- 
validation ol a number of small companies 
making light equipment, under the name 
C-T-H Company (Computer-Tabulating- 
Record). This waa prophetic, consid­
ering how aptiy it described the com­
pany's future business, and especially 
prophetic considering that today's 
Btored-program computer was undreamed 
of at lhat time.
According to Wililsm Rodgers' 
definitive company blogTBphy Think,  
the company's creator was a shrewd 
operator named Charles R. Flint, 
dashing entrepreneur and former gun 
runner to Ihe Soulh American republics, 
who In his shrewdness brought In to 
run the company an incredibly talented, 
fire-breathing and self-righteous indi­
vidual named Thomes J. Watson, even 
though Walson st that time was under 
prison sentence for his sales practicBB 
at another well-known company.  The 
sentence waa never served, and Watson 
went on to preside for many years 
over a corporation to which he gave 
his unique stamp.
Watson arises from lhe pages of 
Think ae a sanctimonious tyrant, 
hard as nails yet reverently principled 
in his words; the pillar of fervid, 
aggressive corporate piety.
IBM was totally Watson'a 
creation. The cmnpany became what 
he admired in others, a mechanism 
totally obedient to his will and imple­
menting his forceful and lnsplrlngly 
rationalized convictions wilh alacrity,
As the Church is said to be the bride 
of Chrlat. IBM  might be characterized 
aa the Bride of Watson, molded to the 
styles of demandlngness. pressure, 
efficiency and pietism which B O  char­
acterized that man. But the Ideas 
flowed from Watson alone, except for 
a few confidantes who received his 
nod. The company is vastly bigger 
now, and slightly more colorful, in a 
muled sort of way: bul it is atill Lhe 
stiff and deadly earnest battalion of 
his dream.
Because of Watson's background 
b b salesman, he made Sales the apeji 
of the corporation. Tha salesmen had 
the most prestige within the company 
and could make the most money; below 
that was administration, below thal. 
technical staff.
W aLaon eliminated the meat-slicing 
machines, and pushed the product line 
based on punched cards developed by 
IBM's (Irsl Chief engineer. Herman 
Hollerith. A ccordlngtoRodgers.lt 
was impetus from lhe Depression, and 
lha new bookkeeping requirements of 
Roosevelt's remedies,  that skyrocketed 
the firm uniquely during the depths of 
general economic catastrophe, til)
Watson came lo draw the highest aalary 
of any man in the nation.  In 1934 his 
income was 1364.432 (Will Rogers, nol 
the author of Think, was second wilh 
S324.314). Watson had neatly arranged 
to gel 5 %  of IBM's net profit.While IBM  participated In the 
creation of certain early ctxnputera. It 
is Interesting thal Walson dismissed 
Eckert and Mauchly whan they came 
around after World War II tring to get 
backing for their ENIAC design. In 
certain waya the Aral true electronic 
computer. Eckert and Mauchly went
lo Remington Rand, and tha reaulting 
Univac waa the flrst canmerclal 
computer.
However, IB M  bounced back 
vary well. If there was on# ihing they 
knew how to do It waa aell, and when 
they brought oul their compulers It 
was practically clear sailing .  (The 
Univac I waa Ihe first of many compu­
ters to be delayed and boggled in tha 
completion at It# software, and this 
considerable setback helped IBM  get 
the lead vary quickly; ihey have 
never lost It since.)
In the early sixties the IBM 7090 
and 7094 were virtually unchallenged 
aa L h e leading scientific computers of 
the country, But IBM  in the late alx- 
Ues almost relinquished the fields of 
very big computers and lime-sharing 
to other companies, and their compu­
ters are not regarded as Innovative-  
Nevertheless, IBM's Systems 360 and 
370. despite various criticisms, have 
been very successful; thousands of 
them are In operation around the globe, 
far more than all Ihelr rivals' big 
compulers all put together. This des­
pite the fact that some of these systems 
have failed, including the big Modal 9 1  
(an economic (allure) and the TSS/360 
time-sharing program, a technical 
catastrophe.
They have from time to time 
been accused of unfair tacdca. and 
various antitruat and other actiona 
(see "Legal Milestones" boa) have 
required IB M  to change Its arrange­
ments In varloua ways. One decree 
required them lo aell lhe canputere 
that before they had only rented; 
another decision, lo. "unbundle." or 
sell computers separately from their 
programs (previously "given" away 
with the computers they ran o n ), Is 
widely believed to have prevented 
government acLon on the same 
matter. Showing characteristic 
finesse. IBM  thereupon lowered the 
computer prices almost Imperceptibly, 
then slapped heavy price-tags on 
the programs thal had previously 
been free.
Recent movea by tho government 
have suggested an especially serious 
and far-reaching anti-trust suit against 
IBM, possibly one that might break the 
company up. with its separate divisions 
going various waya. However, in 
today's climate of coay relations be­
tween business and government. It is 
hard to imagine that such matters 
would not be settled lo IBM's liking. 
This lends a curious tint to a remark 
one IBM  person haa made to the author, 
to wit. that maybe IB M  wanta to be 
broken up. That might be one way of 
reducing the unwleldlness and Inter­
dependency of It# product line; in 
addition to reducing Its vast, under­
utilized personnel base. (Another 
angle: Acdng Attorney General Bork 
has expressed the view that IBM Is 
big only becsuse its products and 
management are wonderful, so the 
antitrust esse may simply evaporate 
during the rump days of the Nixon 
incumbency.)

T H e BKrQOesTioMS
Between the trad e  p re ss and dozens of acquaintances 
In the Held, almost every th in g  I hear about IBM and Its 
products le negative (say five or ten to one)- - except from 
people who work o r have relatives th e re .
Perhaps It's Juat so u r g rapes. Or the authority- 
bating ch aracter of rese arch  ty p e s.  Or selective rea d in g .
Or p erh ap a th e re  really le something sin ister.
Tha major q u estions are th e se .
1. How clean la th eir salesmanship?
2. A re th e ir system s unnecessarily difficult or
cum bersom e on purpose?
3. How deep Is th eir system of entrapment and
farced commitment of the customer? How 
n ecessary  a re  the de-standardlzationa and 
the constant changes?
4. Do they have a final liberating vision? Do they
really , after all. intend to bring about a day 
w hen life is easier for people? When the 
difficulties of p resent-day computer systems, 
eepeclally th eirs, wither away? I think that 
h isto ry 's Judgment on IBM in our time 
may narrow  down to that simple question.
(In thle light it Is not h ard to understand 
IBM's stand on softw are copyrights v s . patents. 
IBM Is agalnet pro g ram s being patentable, which 
would cover ab stracted  properties, but Brgues 
In favor of co p y rig h t, whose protection Is 
probably m ore limited to the particulars of a 
given pro g ram , lf they have thetr way. it would 
be assu red  lhat IBM could uee any ingenious 
new program m ing tric k s wlthoul compensation, 
whsreae all u n n e ce ssary  complications of bulky, 
cumbersome softw are would be covered In 
entirety by c o p y rig h t.)
F inally, it hae not been demonstrated that 
IBM haa any gen eral ablllly to make systems 
conceptually sim ple and easy to u se . (Two 
good exam ples of h a rd  system s are ihe Mag 
Tape Selectric and D atatext-- easy for program- 
mere, bu t h a rd ly  for se crsla riee .) There eeems 
to be no em phasis on elegance or conceptual 
simplicity at IBM. T hose who adopt such a 
philosophy (such ss  K enneth Iverson) do so 
on their ow n.
As mentioned e a rlie r, thle hae something 
to dd w ith the fact that individuals generally 
use IBM's system s b ecause they have to, being 
amployeee o r clients of the O nus lhat renl IBM 
equipment, so th ere le no Impetus to design 
program s or system s to ru n  on simple or clear- 
minded p rin cip les, o r d rese  oul intricate systems 
so they can be u se d  eaaily.
4. THE IMAGE.
It Is h a rd  to analyze images, corporate or 
perso n al. T hey a re  often received In such differ­
ent ways by d ifferent populations. But there may be 
a commonality to th e IBM Image as generally seen. 
The Image of IBM Involves some kind of cold magic, 
a brooding se n se of ste rile  efficiency. But other 
things are percolating In there. If we slide that 
connotation of efficiency aside, ihe IBM Image 
seems to have two oth er principal ccmponents: 
authoritarianism  and com placency. It Is this mix­
ture that lo n g h alrs will naturally find revolting.
This same com bination, how ever, may be exactly 
whal It le th al appeals to business-manageraent 
types.
IP YOU REALLY WANT I T ...
you cap g et c h aracter-b y -ch aracter 
resp o n d in g  system s on DM com puters.  
T he new Stock Exchange system uses a 
"Telecom munications Access Method" 
perm itting non-IBM term inals to rsspond 
ch ax acte r-b y -ch a ra cter. Just as systems 
for non-com puter-people sh o u ld .
T ry in g  to u se this input-output 
p ro g rsm  on y our local IBM a m p u te r 1s 
another pro b lem , though. Aside frcn 
p rogram  rsn ta l co sts, ihere Is the p rob­
lem of Its com patibility with the whole 
line of IBM aoftw are. Adaptations and 
reprogram m ing would probably be 
n ece ssary  up an d  down tha line. ITHE FUTURE
Whal will IBM do next?
Speculation Is almost futile, but necessary 
anyhow. The prospects are fascinating if nol 
terrifying.
No one can ever predict whal IBM will do; but 
trying to predict IBM's actlone-- IBM-watching is 
something like K rem lin-w atching-- Is everybody's 
hobby In the field. And Its consequences affect 
everybody. With 60 many things possible, and 
determined only in the vaguest way by technical 
considerations, the question of what IBM chooses 
to do next Is pretty sc ary . Because whatever 
they do we'll be sluck w ith. They can deaign our 
llvee for the foreseeable future.
We know ihBt ln the fulure IBM will announce 
new machines end system s, price changes (both up 
and down) In fascinating p atterns, rearrangem ents 
of what they will " su p p o rt,n  and changes In the 
contracts they offer (see box. "IBM's Control") . 
Occasional hlgh-publlcity speeches by IBM high 
ofllcer6 will continue to be watched with great care. 
But mainly we don’t know.
IBM's slick manufacturing capabilities mean 
that practically any machine they wanted to make.  
and put on a single chip, they could, and in a 
very short time. (The grapevine hae it lhat the 
Components Division, which makee the computer 
parts, ha6 bragged within the company that It 
doeen't really need the other divisions any more 
-- it eould Just pul whole computers on teeny 
chips 1 1  il wanted to.)
In thle time of the 370, things are for the 
moment stable. The 370 computer line is still their 
main m arketing th ru st. Having sold a lot of 370 
computers (basically sped-up 3 60s), their Idea is 
at the momenl to eell conversion jobs to adapl the 
370 to ru n  Ihe new "Virtual System" conlrol pro­
gram (VS or OS/VS or various other n am es).  This 
system (which is. Incidentally, widely respected) 
makes core memory effectively much larger lo 
program s that run on it. This effecUvely encour­
ages program m ers to use tons of core, by means 
of virtual memory; eeBsnlielly getting people In 
the habit of programming ae if core were infinite.
T his extension of apparent memory size distracts 
from any Inefficiencies of both locally written p ro ­
gram s and IBM program s, thus tending to Increase 
use and rental ch arg es.
When thBt m arketing impetus runs out we'll 
see the next thing.
T hs other new IBM Initiative Is with smaller 
machines, the System 3 and System 7, being pushed 
for relatively small buslneeses. Thst Is w here they 
see another new m arket. How easy and useful their 
program s are In this area will be an Important 
question.
With the System 7. a 16-blt minicomputer 
lor $17,000, IBM h as at last genuinely entered the 
minicomputer m arket. (.Balancing Its speed and 
coat against comparable m achines, we can figure 
the IBM m arkup ae being about 50%, which la 
typical.)
In addition. It Is rumored that IBM mighl 
pul out a tiny busin ess mini, to sell out of OPD. 
(Datamation. Dec 72. 139.) But really, who knows.
In addition to this huge-memory strategy for 
Its big machines, and th s starting foray Into spe­
cialized mini system s, there is the office strategy 
and "word p rocessing."
IBM h as conceptually consolidated Ils 
various m agic-typew rlter and texl services under 
the name of "word p ro cessin g ," which means any 
handling of text that goes through their machines. 
This superficially unites their OPD efforts (type­
w riters and dictation machines) with things going 
on In DPD, such as Daiatexi. and allays inter- 
dlvlalonal riv alries for awhile. Also, by stre ss­
ing the unity of the subject matter, ll leaves the 
door open for later and more glamorous Initiatives, 
such as hypertext system s (see "Carmody's System ." 
flip sid e ) .
In other w ords, the foot Is in  Ihs door. Mr. 
Businessman has the idea that automatic typing 
and things like that are IBM's special province.,  Even if ll is tru e, as Anonymous says (see Bibliography) 
thal IBM Intimidates people and keeps Its enemies 
from getting Jobs at IBM-oriented establishm ents, 
that's not the end of the w orld.
I Crosch, Gould, n o dgers and McGurk are alive and w orking, 
j Extramural harassm ent like that employed by CM against 
N ader, for exam ple. has not been rep o rte d .
END OF THE’DINOSAURS?
To a very greal extent, IBM'e compuier 
market Is based on big computers run In batch 
mode, u nder a very obtrusive operating system.
Many people are beginning to notice, ihough, 
thal many things are more sensibly done on small 
computers than on big ones, even in companies 
that have big com puters. Thai way they can be 
done right away rather than having to wait in line. 
Is this the mammal that will eat the dinosaur eggs?
On the olher hand, a very unfortunate trend 
is beginning to appear, an implicit feud within 
large organizations, which may benefit IBM's big 
computer approach. Those who advocate mini­
computers a re  being opposed by managers of the 
big computing installations, who see the mini6 
as threatening their own power and budgete. This 
may for a long time hold the minis back, perhaps 
wilh Ihe help and advice of compuier salesmen who 
feel likewise threatened. But there will be no 
holding back the minis and their myriad offspring, 
the m icroprocessors (see p. ^  ). And Ihe inroads 
should begin soon.
(Others are growing to know and love true 
high-capBcity tim e-sharing as a way of life, like 
lhat offered for DEC. GE and Honeywell machines. 
T his, too, msy begin lo have derogatory effects on 
IBM's m arksts.)
Finally, it must be noled that almost all big 
companies have com puters, usually IBM com puters, 
and so an era of m arketing may well have ended.
It may be possible for IBM io go on selling bigger 
and bigger computers lo Ihe customers who already 
have them, but obviously this growth can no 
longer be exponential.
Few firms anyw here have the confidence 
to advertise generically a product which 
la made by others as w ell, as in IBM'e 
"Think of the computer as energy" se rie s.Herb Groech. now editorial director of Com puterw orld, Is perhaps 
IBM’s worst enemy. Once he w orked for old man Watson, and was the 
only IBM employee allowed to have a b eard . Now, among other things, he 
gives speeches and testimony w herever possible about the Menace of IBM, 
at conferences, at governmental hearin g s, and In letters to editors.
Yet IBM's main computer sales strategy today is to slre ss the advan­
tages of big computers wilh lots of core memory (and p ersuade you you 
d o n 't want highly Interactive systems o r Independent m inicom puters).
And the fundamental ru le elating the advantages of big computers 
Is callsd G rosch's Law, formulated y e ars ago by none other. See p.

”1 W  ? J ) ? e o | > kDigital Equipment Corporation, in response 
to the "Bnergy Crisis" ol 1973, didn't him out 
their Christmas tree. InBlead they hooked it up 
to a water wheel they happened lo have. Typical.
T he computer companies are often referred 
to In Uie field aa "Snow White and the Seven 
D w arfs"-- a phrase that stays the same even as 
the leaser ones (like RCA and General Electric) 
g«t out o f the business one by one. The phrase 
suggests that they’re all alike. To an extent; 
but there Is one company sufficiently different, 
and Important enough both In its history and Ita 
continuing eminence, to require exposition here, 
This Is Digital Equipment Corporation, usually 
pronounced " D e c k t h e  people who first brought 
out the minicomputer and continue to make One 
etufT for people who know what they are doing.
O ther computer companies have mimicked 
IBM. They have bull! big computers and I tied 
to sell them to big corporations (or their business 
data processing, or big "scientific" machines and 
tried to sell them lo scientists.
DEC wanl about il differently, always de­
signing for the people who knew what they were 
doing, and always going lo great lengths lo tell 
you exactly whai their equipment did.
First they made circuits for people who 
wanted lo tie digital equipment together. Then, 
since they had the circuits anyway, ihey manu­
factured a computer (the PDP-1). Then more 
com puters. Increasing the line slowly, but always 
telling potential users as much ss they could 
possibly want lo know.
The same for its manuals. People who 
wrote for Information from Digital would oflen 
gel. not a summary aheel referring you to a local 
sales office, bul ■ complete manual (say, for 
the PDP-8), Including chapters on programming, 
how lo build inlerfacea lo It, and the enact 
tim ing and distribution of Ihe main Internal pulses. 
The effect of Ihls was that sophisticated uaers-- 
especially in universities and research estab­
lishm ents— started building their own. Their 
own inlerfacea, Iheir own modifications to DEC 
computers, their own original systems around 
DEC computers.This policy has made (or alow but steady 
growth. In effect. Digital buili a national cus­
tomer base among the most sophisticated clients, 
The kids who aa undergraduates and hangers-on 
built Interfaces and kludgey arrangemenls. now 
aa project heads build big fancy systems around 
DEC equipment. The places that know computers 
usually have a variety of DEC equipment around, 
usually drastically modified.
Because of the great success of Its small 
compulers, especially lhe PDP-0, even many com­
puter people think they only make small compu­
ters. in (acl their big compuier, the PDP-10, Is 
one of the most successful time-sharing compulera. 
An example of its general esteem in lhe field: It 
is the host computer of ARPAHET, the national 
computer network among scientific installations 
funded by the Department of Defense; basically 
this means ARPANET is a network of PDP-lOs.
DEC'S compulers have always been designed 
by programmers, for programmers. This made 
for considerable suspense when the PDP-11 did 
not appear, even though the higher numbers did, 
and the- grapevine had it that Ihe 11 would be 
a sixteen-bit machine, ll proved to be well 
wailing for (see p. 2 2 ) ,  and has since become 
the standard sophisticated 16-blt machine In the 
industry .
An area DEC has emphasized from the first 
has been computer display (discussed at length 
on the flip side). Thus il is no surprise thal 
ihelr interactive animated compuier display, the 
GT40 (see p . M i) is an outstanding design and 
success. (And the University of Utah, currently 
lhe mother church of computer display, runs lls 
graphic systems from PDP-lOs.)
In this plucky, homespun company, where 
even president Olsen is known by his first name 
(Ken), It Is understandable lhal marketing pizazz 
takes a back seat. This apparently was the view 
of a group of rebels,  led by vice president Ed 
deCastra, who broke off In the lale sixties to 
slarl a new computer company around a 16-bll 
compuier design called Ihe Nova— rumored lo 
have been a rejected design for the PDP-11. The 
company they siarted, Daia General, has not been 
afraid lo use lhe hard sell, and between their 
hard sell and sound machine line they've seriously 
challenged lhe parent company.
But Digital marches o n . tltc O r-p u ter Kur.'s 
compuier company. If IBM is computerdcm's 
Kodak, whose overpriced but quite reliable goods 
have various drawbacks. DEC is Nikon, wilh u 
mix-and-match assortment of wlmi the hoishots 
want. That's pluralism for you.PDP-2,  0 o r 13.)

matter how intricate, can be enacted by a compu­
ter modal. Anything you can express exactly 
can be carred out. and you can see Ita conse- 
quances in Ihe computer'e readout—  a printout, 
a acreen display, or some other view Into the 
resulting data structure.
Obvioualy these enactments (or sometimes 
"predictions") a n  wholly fallible, deriving any 
validity they may have from the soundness of 
the initial data or model.
However, they have another Important 
function, one which Is going to be very Impor­
tant In education and. I hope, general public 
understanding, as computen gel spread about 
more widely and become more usable.
Tha availability of simulation models can 
make things easier lo understand. Well-sel-up 
almulatlon programs, available eaally through 
terminals, can be used aa Staged Explanatory 
Structure* and Theoretical Exploration Tools.
The user can build hie own wars, his own so­
cieties , his own economic conditions, and eee 
what follows from the waye he sets ihem up. 
Importantly, different theories can be applied lo

quences of one or the other point of view.

able for Congreaa. to allow them to pour a new

who gains...)
I should point oul h e n  thal tor this pur­
pose—  insightful Simulation-- you don't alweye 
need a computer. I have In mind Ihe so-called 
"simulation games.'1  which If wsll designed give 
extraordinary Insights to ihe players. Allen 
Calhamer's brilliant game of Diplomacy, for In­
stance (Gamea Research. Boston; available from 
Bnntano's. NYC) teaches more about Iniernstional 
politics than you could suppose possible. I am 
alao Intrigued by a game called "Slmaoc," worked 
out by a sociologist lo demonstrate the develop­
ment of social structures from a state of random 
ereation. but I haven't played It. (Clark C.
Abl. of Abt Assoclatea. Boston, haa also done 
a lol of Interesting design h e n .)
A  last point, a very "prectlcal" application. 
Simulation makes 1 1  possible to enact things with­
out trying them out in concrete reality. For In­
stance. In Ihe lens-deslgn systems mentioned 
earlier. Ihe lenses don'l have to be actually built 
to find out their detailed characteristics. Nor

to determine the outcomes of all Ihe unpredictable

turned out to be most effective.
Example,  In 1873 the Saturday Review of

Effectively the game had been played thousand* of

The focus of attention In genetics and 
organic chemistry has for a decade now been 
the remarkable systems and structures of the 
molecules of life, DN A  and RNA.
DNA Is the basic molecule of life, a long 
and tiny strand of encoded Information. Actually 
il Is a digital memory, a stored representation 
of codes necessary to sustain, reproduce, and 
even duplicate the creature around it.
It is literally and exactly a digital memory. 
Its symbols are nol binary but quaternary, as 
each position contains one of four code molecules; 
however, as it takes three molecules in a row to 
make up one individual codon, or functioning 
symbol, Ihe actual number of possible symbols 
is 6 4 " the number of possible combinations of 
four different symbols In a row of three. (I don't 
know the adjective for slxtyfourishness, and it's 
just as well.)
The basic mechanism of the system was 
worked out by Francis Crick and Janes Watson, 
who understsndably got the Nobel Prize for it. 
The problem was this: how could living ceils 
transmit their overall plans to the cells they 
split Into? —  and how could these plane be 
carried out by a mechanical process?
The mechanism Is astonishingly elegant. 
Basically there Is one long molecule, the DNA 
molecule, which Is really a long tape recording 
of all the information required to perpetuate 
the organism and reproduce il. This is a 
long helix (or corkscrew), as Linus Pauling 
had guessed years before. The chemical pro­
cesses permit the helix to be duplicated, to 
become two stitched-together corkscrews, and 
then for them to come apart, unwinding to go 
their separate ways to daughter cella.
As a tape recording, the molecule directs 
the creation of chemicals and other cells by an 
intricate series of processes, nol well understood. 
Basically, though, the Information on the basic 
D NA tape is transferred to a new tape, an active 
copy c a lle d  "messenger RNA," which be- 
conea an a c tu a l playback d ev ic e fo r Che 
c r e a tio n  of oav m olecules a c co rd in g  to 
the p lan  scored on che o r ig in a l.
Some things are known about this process 
and some aren't, and 1 may have this wrong, 
but basically the DNA-- and its converted copy, 
the RNA— contain plans for making all the 
basic protein molecules of the body, and anything 
else that can be made with amino ad d s. (Those 
molecules of the body which are not proteins or 
built of amino acids are later made In chemical 
processes brought about by these kinds.)
Now well may you ask how this long tape 
recording makes chemical molecules. The answer, 
eo far as Is known, is extremely puzzling.
As already mentioned, the basic code 
molecules (or nitrogenous bases) are arranged 
In groups of three. When the RNA 1s turned 
on. these Qriples latch onto the molecules of 
amino acid that happen to be floating by in the 
soupy interior of ihe cell. (There are twenty-- 
seven amino acids, and sixty-four possible 
combinations of three bases; this is fine, because 
several different codons of three bases can glom 
onto the same passing amino acid.)
Now, the tape recording is divided Into 
separate sections or templstes; and each template 
does its own thing. When a template is filled, 
the string of amino acids in that section separate, 
and the long chain thal results is a particular 
molecule of significance in some aspect of the 
critter's life processes—  often a grand long 
thing that folds up in a certain way, exposing 
only certain active surfaces lo the ongoing 
chemistry of the cell.One theory about the mechanics of this is 
that a sort of zipper allde, called the ribosome, 
chugs down the tape, attaching the called-for~~ 
amino acids and peeling off the ever-longer result.
Now, here are some of the funny things 
lhat are known about this. One is that there is 
a particular codon of three bases that is a stop 
code. Just like a period in ordinary punctuation. 
This signals the end of a template. Another is 
that the templates on Ihe tape are in no partic­
ular order, but distributed higgledy-piggledy. 
(Geneticists engaged in mapping the genes of a 
particular species of creature find that the gene 
for eye color may turn out to be right next to 
the gene for length of tail— but where those 
are really. and what the particular molecules do 
that determine it, are still mysterious sorts of 
question.)
Here Is some more weird stuff about this.
Large sections of the ONA strand are "dark." 
il turns out, just meaningless stretches of random 
combinations of bases lhat don't mean anything-- 
or ever get used. This ties in, of course, with 
the notion thal genetic change is random and 
blind: the general supposition is lhat genetic 
mutallon takes place a base or two at a time, 
and Ihen something else activates a chance com­
bination in a dry slretch that turns out to be 
useful, and thia is somehow perfected through 
successive 1-base changes during the process 
of successive mutation and evolution.
Amazing U 6e ia made of these mechanisms 
by some viruses. Now, viruses are often thought 
of as the most basic form of life, but actually 
they are usually dependent on aome other form 
and hence more streamlined than elemental. Well, 
some viruses (bul not all) have the capacity for 
inserting themselves ln the genetic material: 
breezing up lo Ihe DN A  or RNA. unhooking it in 
a certain place and lying down there, then being 
duplicated as part of the template, then unhooking 
themselves and toddling away— both parent virus 
and copy. I can't for the life of me think of an 
analogy to this, but I keep visualizing it as hap­
pening somehow in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.
CONTROL M ECHANtSM S
Now, all cell 6 are not alike. From the first 
beginning cell of the organism (the zygote), various 
splits create more and more specialized, differ­
entiated cells. A liver cell is extremely different 
from a brain cell, bul they both date back by 
successive splitting from that first zygole. Yet 
they have different structures and manufacture 
different chemicals.
One simplification may be possible: the 
"structure" of a cell may really be its chemical 
composition, since cell walls and other struc­
tures are thought to be special knittinga of 
certain tricky molecules. Oksy, so that may 
reduce the question slightly. How then does 
the cell change from being an Original (undif­
ferentiated. zygotic) cell to the Specialized 
cells thal manufacture particular other complex 
chemicals?
One hypothesis was that these other cells 
have different plans ln them, different tapes.
But this theory was discarded when John Gurdon 
at Oxford produced a fresh frog zygote from the 
Intestinal cell of a frog (which accordingly, ln 
due lime, became a frog de facto) . This proved, 
most think, that the whole tape is in eveTy cell.
Thus there must be something-or-other 
that blocks the different templates at different 
times (You there, now you're a full-fledged epi­
thelial cell, never mind what you did before) 
and selects among all the subprograms on the tape.

COMPUTERISH CONJECTURES
The guys who specialize in this are usually 
chemists, and presumably know what they're 
doing, so Ihe following remarks are not intended 
as butting into chemistry. However, new per­
spectives often give fresh insight; and the matters 
we've covered so far might seem to hsve a cer­
tain relevance.
DNA and RNA, as already remarked, may 
without distortion be thought of as a tape. Indeed, 
on this tspe is a data structure* and indeed It is 
a dala structure which seems lo be involved with 
the execution of a program-- the program that 
occurs as the organism's cells differentiate.
There Is evidently some sort of program 
follower which Is capable of branching to dif­
ferent selections of (or subprograms) In the 
overall program, depending on various factors 
In the cell's environment** or perhaps its age.
Now, It is one thing to look for the par­
ticular chemical mechanisms that handle this.
That's fine. On the other hand, we can also 
consider (from ihe top down) whst sort of a 
program follower It must be to behsve like thle. 
(This is like the difference between tracing oul 
particular circuitry and trying to figure out 
the structure of a program from how 11 behaves.)
At any rate, the following interesting con­
jectures arise:
1. The mechanism of somatic reproduction is 
a subroutining progrsm follower-- not unlike 
the second program follower of the subroutining 
display (see p. That Is. it steps very 
slowly through a master program somewhere, 
and with each new step directs the blocking or 
unblocking of particular stretches of the tape.
As the program is ln each cell, presumably 
it is being separately followed in each cell.
(This is sometimes called distributed computing.)
2. In each cell, the master program is direc­
ting certain tests, whose results may or may not 
command program branching— successive steps 
to new states of the overall program. It may
be teating for particular chemical secretions in 
its environment; it could even be testing a counter.
3. (This is the steep one.) If this were so,
we might suppose that this program too was stored 
on the DNA, in one or more program areas; and 
it would therefore be necessary lo postulate some 
addressing mechanism by which the program fol­
lower can find the templates to open and close.
(And perhaps farther sections of the progrsm.)
4. Indeed, it makes sense to suppose that 
such a program has the form of a dispatch table 
-- a list of addresses in the tape, perhaps asso­
ciated with specifications of ihe tests which are 
to cause the branching.

These wild speculations are offered ln the 
spirit of Interdisciplinary good fellowship and 
good clean fun. Whether ( 1) and (2) have any 
actual content, or are merely paraphrases of 
what is already known or diaproven, I don't 
know; somebody may find the rest suggestive.
Two more observations, though. These 
are not particularly deep, and may indeed be 
obvious, but they suggest an approach.

whatever It Is that turns an old differentiated

we should all practice and have ready at the

W HY THE HELL NOT? YOU'RE THE ONES WITH 
THE COMPUTERS, NOT M E!
Let's froth up a little citizen indignation here.
A O T j r k J O i ^
In principle we no longer need account 
numbers.
Now lhat text processing facilities are 
available in moat (if not all) major computer 
languages, the only excuse for not using these 
features ia the programmer's notion of his own 
convenience— not lhat of the outside customer 
or victim.
Example. Someone I know got brand new 
^ ■ ^ ■ n ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a n d  credit
cards. He made no note of their num bers. Then 
he lost them both. Duly he reported (he losses. 
Neither service could look him u p . they sa id , 
without the num bers. Not having used them , he 
had no bills to check. Even though he was the 
only person at that address with anything like 
that name. And why not, pray tell? Either be­
cause they were fibbing, or because they had 
not seen fit to create a simple straightforward 
program for the purpose. (See Basic Rejoinder, 
nearby.)
I have heard of similar cases involving 
major life insurance companies. Don't lose the 
num bers. Let's all dance lo it:
When anything is issued to you,
Write the num ber down." ( b H fo T C V "  ,  ,  
T H h T ]> o H T
Few of us can help feeling outrage at 
the book clubs, or subscription offices, or 
billing departments, that don’t reply to our 
letters. Or reply inappropriately, with a form 
printout that doesn't match the problem.
First let's understand how this happens.
These outfits are based on using the com­
puter to handle all correspondence and trans­
actions. The "office" may not have any people 
in it at all— that is, people whose job it is 
to understand and deal sensibly with the prob­
lems of customers. Instead, there may just be 
keypunch operators staffing a Balch System, set 
up by someone who has long since moved on.
The poinl of a batch system (see p .fS ”) 
is to aave money and bother by handling every­
thing in a controlled flow. This does not mean 
in principle that things have to be rigid and 
restrictive, bul it usually means it in practice. 
(See "The Punch Card M entality," p. •)
The system is set up with only a fixed number 
of event types, and so only those events are 
recognized ae occurring. Most important, your 
problem is assumed to be one that will be 
straightened out in the course of the system's 
flow. While there may be provision for excep­
tions-- one clerk, perhaps-- your problem has 
not seemed to him worthy of making an excep­
tion for.
Here is my solution. It has worked 
several times, particularly on book clubs that 
ignored typed letters and kept billing me 
incorrectly.
Get a roll of white shelf paper, two or 
three feet wide and twenty o r more feet long.
Write a letter on Ihe shelf paper in magic 
m arker. Make it big, perhaps six inches to a 
word. Legibility is necessary, but don'l make 
it too easy to read.
Explain the problem cle arly .
Now lake your punch c a rd -- you did gel 
one. didn’t you, a bill o r something?-- and 
mutilate it carefully. Tear it in quarters, or 
cut it into lace, or something. But make sure 
the serial number is still legible. Staple it 
lovingly to your nice big letter,.
Now fold your letter, and find an envelope 
big enough for it to fil in, and send it. regis­
tered o r certified mail, to ANY HUMAN BEING, 
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT, o r w hatever, and 
the company's address.
This really works quite well.
I am assuming here, now, that your prob­
lem has merit, and you have been denied the 
attention required to settle il. If we want justice 
we must ourselves be just.
There is one further step , but, again, to 
be used only in proportion to the offense. This 
step is to be used only if a meritorious commun­
ication, like thal already described, has not 
been properly responded to in a decent interval.
We assume that this unjust firm has sent 
you a reply envelope or card on which they 
must pay postage. Now carefully drafting a 
follow-up letter, explain once again, in civil 
language, the original problem, your efforts 
at attention, and so o n . Now put it in a package 
with a ten or twelve-pound rock, affix the 
reply envelope to the outside, and send it off.
The problem, you see, has been to get 
out of the batch stream and be treated as an 
exception. Flagrantly destroying the punch card 
serves to remove you from the flow in that fash­
ion. (However, just tearing it a little bit prob­
ably won't: a card that is intact but tom  can 
simply be put in a certain slot of the card-punch 
and duplicated. Destroy it good and plenty.)
ln all these cases remember: the problem 
is not that you are "being treated as a number," 
whatever that means, but that y our case does 
not correctly fall in the categories that have 
been set up for it . By forcing attention to your 
case as an exception, you are making them 
realize that more categories are needed, o r more 
people to handle exceptions. If more people do 
this when they have a just complaint, service 
will improve rapidly.The people who send it out like to call it 
personalized advertising and the like. But most 
of us call it Junk Mail. And its vagaries are 
NOT THE POOR COMPpTER'S FAULT. What gets 
people angry derives from the system buill 
around Ihe poor computer.
You may wonder why you get more and 
more seed catalogs, o r gift-house catalogs, as 
time goes on, even though you never order any­
thing from them. O r why a deceased member 
of the household goes on getting mail year 
in and year out, regardless of your angry post­
cards.
How does it keep coming?
Through the magic of something called Ihe 
Mailing L ist.
And especially the peculiar way lhat 
mailing lists are bought and sold.
Now, a mailing list is a series of names 
and addresses of possible custom ers, stored on 
computer tape o r d is k .
You can buy the use of a mailing list.
But you cannot buy the mailing list itself.
Suppose you have a brochure advertising 
pumpkin-seed relish, which you suggest has 
rejuvenating powers. You want this brochure 
to go out to rich college g ra d u ates.
You go to a m ailing-list house.
"I cannot sell you this mailing list out­
right," says the jolly p roprietor, "for it is my 
business to sell its use again and again, so 
I do not want anybody else to have a copy of 
it." So you leave 2500 pumpkin-seed relish 
brochures with the mailing list company, and 
pay them a lot of money. And they swear on 
a stack of bibles that they have mailed the bro­
chures to their special list of rich college grad­
uates.
Well, let's say you get 2S0 sales from 
that mailing. (10% is fantastically good.) But 
out of curiosity you go to another mailing-list 
house and have another mailing sent out— this 
one to people who have low incomes and little 
education.
This time you get 15%  o r d e rs .
Now guess what you are acquiring.
A mailing list of your very  own. Of peo­
ple who eat pum pkin-seed relish.
Mailing lists are, you eee, generally ren­
ted blind, with no chance to see the addressees 
or check as to w hether they've already been 
mailed to.
And thal explains all the duplications.
If an advertiser is going after a certain 
type of customer, and goes to several mailing- 
list houses asking for mailings to that particular 
type of customer, chances are some people will 
be on several of the lis ts . And since there's 
no way to intercompare the lis ts . these poor 
guys get several copies of the mailing.
(Another way this can happen is if some 
cheapskate has his own mailing list and doesn't 
check it for repeats of the same name. Bul 
writing the computer program  to check for 
repeats of the same name is not easy— there 
might just be a Robert Jones and a Rob Jones 
at the same address— and these things are not 
usually checked m anually. T h e y 're  b ig .)
Another possibility exists for eliminating 
duplications when you rent mailing liats. You 
can bring in a magnetic tape with your mailing 
lisl on i t , and they can send out the mailing 
only to the members of th e ir' list who are nol 
already on your list. That way you still can't 
steal their list, since the tape ie on their 
premises. The trouble is , they can steal your 
list, by making a copy of the tape. Oh dear.


--- Page 63 ---

One possibility, nice and expensive, is to 
re n t a num ber of mailing lists from a single 
m ailing-list house, with them guaranteeing that 
th e y ’ll com pare all the lists you choose and 
not sen d  to any person more than once.
But as you may be suspecting, this costs 
m oney. All this screening and iniercomparing 
re q u ire s  com puter time, and so, even though 
you a re  getting a more and more perfect mailing, 
you a re  paying reore and more and more money 
for it. So you can see why reasonable business­
m en a re  w illing to send out ads even when they 
know  some recipients will get several duplicates.
A nother interesting point. There are 
m ailing lists for all kinds of different possible 
c u sto m ers. The possibilities are endless.

Note that mailing lists are priced according 
to th e ir desirability. Weeded mailing lists, fea­
tu rin g  only Live Ones, people who've ordered 
b ig  in  re ce n t times, are more expensive. Lists 
o f d o cto rs, who buy a lot, .are m ore  expensive 
than lists of social w orkers. And so on.
T hen there’s the m atter.of the pitch.
T he a d 's phrasing may be built around 
th e m ailing plan. Some circulars come right out 
and tell the recipient he's going to get several 
copies because he's such a wonderful person.
THEN there sre those advertisements that 
a re  actually printed by the com puter, or at least 
c e rta in  lin es are filled in with the recipient's 
nam e and possibly some snazzy phrases to make 
him th in k  it's  a personal letter. Who responds 
to su ch  th in g s 1  don't know. My favorite was 
th e o n e -- I w ish I could find it to include here 
- -  that w ent something like

1 d o n 't know whether I enjoyed the spaces or 
th e Main S treet more.
But you see how this works. T here's 
this b atc h -processing program , see, and the 
nam es an d  addresses are on one long tape, and 
the tap e goes through, and the program takes 
one re c o rd  (a name and ad d re ss), and decides 
w h e th e r to call the addressee "M r.," "Ms." or 
w h a te v e r, and then plugs his name into the 
p rin to u t lin es that give it That Personal Touch; 
an d  th en  th e mailing envelope o r sticker is 
p rin te d ; and the tape moves on to the next 
r e c o r d .

Presumably this won't help with

and they say, "I'm afraid I can't get that infor­
mation. You see, it's on a com puter.”
(See Basic Rejoinder, n ea rb y .)
Well, the reason it's this way is that 
they're handling things in Batch (see p .* |5  ) 
and they aren 't storing your account on disk, 
or if they are they don't have a terminal they 
can query il with.
But to aay that they can't get the infor­
mation because it's on a computer is a typical 
use of the computer as an excuse (see C yber­
crud, p . $ ); and second, if the person b e­
lieves this to be an explanation, it's  a sign of 
the intimidation and obfuscation that have been 
sown among the clerks who don't understand

E v ery w h ere you go com puters l u r k . Yet 
they wear so m any faces it's  im possible to  figure 
w h al's going on.
G uidelines a re  h ard  to lay down h e re , but 
if you look for exam ples of things y o u 'v e already 
run into in th is book, it may help som e.
T erm inals you can presum ably reco g n ize.
M icroprocessors are h a rd e r, b ec a u se  you

or m icro p ro cesso r.
Two o th e r th in g s to watch for: tran sactio n  
system s and d ata b ase system s.
A tran sactio n  system  is  any system  that 
takes note of, a n d  p erh ap s re q u ire s verification 
of, tran sactio n s. Example: the new poin t-o f-sale 
system s (PO S). T his is  w h at's about to  replace 
the cash r e g is te r .

w hich will rin g  il up by amount and category 
(for tax p u rp o s e s ), and even keep track  of 
in v e n to ry , n oting each object as it is rem oved 
from stock.
Here is w hat y o u r b a r code will look lik e. 
(A c irc u la r co d e, which w as a lread y  tu rn in g  up

Data b ase system s are any system s w hich

can stop at a n y  S tu ck ey 's and ask for th e ir

Is th is to avoid p ra n k s?  And what about people 
wilh no phones?) It's  free and a neat id ea. 
(O bviously, th e m essages a re  stored on th e  disk  
of a b ig  c en tral com puier, and q u eried  from 
term inals at th e individual sta n d s .)
Now,  most o f th e b ig  system s you r u n  into

p lans to sit in them , and in some cases w hai 
they intend lo e a t. When you b uy your* tic k e t,
•hat tran sactio n  th e n  gets you pu t in the listin g . 
Same for car re n ta ls  and so on.T he potential d a n g e rs of transaction system s 
a re  fairly obvious from the su p erm ark et exam ple,

Yet we plunge ah ead , and it is obvious w hy.

FACTIONAL ANALYSIS, now possible with new­
found precision on the basis of certain election 
re tu rn s.
COMPUT-  
EROTICA
I s  i t  too soon to r  a 
conputer pornography co n test?
( Is  I t  too la te ?)
See p .This is based on the cynical, and fairly 
reliable, view lhat people vote according to 
what faction of the greater populace Ihey belong 
to-- middle-class white liberals, blue-collar 
non-union members, and so on. The factions 
change slowly over time, and people move 
among them, but the fact of factionalism remains 
unchanged.
Well. By the close of a major election 
campaign, most factions can be pretty well pre­
dicted, especially aa lo presidential choice, or 
what proportion of that faction will go for a 
given candidate.
But some factions' reactlona are not cer­
tain up to the day of the ballot.
So. "Computer predictions" of elections 
basically break the country into its factional 
divisions, stale by stale and district by district, 
and then tabulate who can be predicted to vole 
for whom on a factional basis.
Then what's the suspense?
The suspense comes from the uncertain 
factions— groups whose final reactions aren't 
known as the election starts.
People think computers are rigid 
and invariant. This (as stated else­
where in this book) is due to the systems 
which people have imposed,  and then 
blamed, on the computer.
The fact is that computers are now 
being set up to give new flexibility to 
manufacturing processes. Computers, 
directly connected to milling machines, 
grind raetal into any conceivable shape 
much faster than a human craftsman. To 
change the result, change the program-- 
in a fraction of a second. Fabric des­
ign has been done on computer screens; 
the obvious next step is to have the 
computer control the loom or knitting 
machine and immediately produce what- 
ever*s been designed.
Custom clothing: soon we may look 
forward to tailoring services that store 
your ilieasurements and can custom-tailor 
a suit for you to any new fashion, in 
minutes. (But will the price beat Hong 
Kong?) Customized printed matter is 
already here (see "Me-Books," p-£7). 
Wherever people want individual varia­
tions of a basic manufacturing process, 
computers can do it.

THOSE THINGS ON THE RAILROAD CARS
As we lean on the fence a-chaw in' an' 
a-walchin' the trains go b y , we note strange 
insignia on their sides, in highly reflective 
Scotch-Lite all begrimed by travel.
Basically il's a stack of horizontal stripes 
In red , blue and other colors. T his ia ACI, 
for Automatic C ar Identification.  It may yet 
straighten out the railroads.
In this neolithic industry, it ia not known 
at any given time where a railroad company's 
cars are. and some peculiar etiquette governs 
their unrequesled use by other firm s in the 
industry. Yet the obvious solution may come 
about: a running inventory of w here all th e cars 
are, where each one is going, w hal’s in It, 
and who that belongs to, Bul, of course, that's 
still in the w orks. Revolutionary ideas take lime.75

The national phone company (usually 
called affectionately, "Ma Bell") has drastically 
changed ita sw itching methods in the last few 
years. T hey a re  replacing the old electrom ech­
anical sw itches, o r "cro ssb ars,"  with a new 
device called the ESS, or Electronic Switching 
System. If th e re 's  one in yo u r area you may 
hear about it In  th e ir jolly new s sheet that you 
jet with the b ill.
In the old cro ssb ar days, a phone con­
nection was a phone connection and that was 
th at. Now. with the ESS, all so rts of new com­
binations are possible: the ESS has stored p ro ­
gram s that determ ine ils operation. If you 
dialled a non-w orking num ber, it jumps to a 
program  to take care of lhal. It does all so rts 
of things b y  special program , and new program s 
can be created for special purposes. Now the 
phone company is try in g  to find the serv ices 
lhat people will pay for. Having calls rero u ted  
tem porarily lo o th e r num bers? Linking up 
several people in a conference call? Storing 
your m ost-called num bers, so you can reach 
them with a single o r double digit?
These p articu lar services are now being 
offered experim entally,
The way it w orks is this: there a r e  a 
num ber of program s stored in a core memory; 
the only "output device" of the system consists 
of ils field of reed sw itches, arranged to close 
circuits of th e telephone network.
Depending on the num bers that h av e been 
dialled, and whatnot, the ESS jum ps to a specific 
program , and that tells it to connect an incom ing 
call to p articu lar other circuits, or to rin g  other 
lin e s, o r w h a te v e r.
It's really neat.
T here are only a couple of things to w orry
about.
One is that it makes w iretapping, not a 
complex bother involving clipped w ires and men 
hunched over in cram ped spaces, but a sim ple 
program .
Another is lhat some people think that 
blue-boxers (see nearby) may be able to program  
it, from the comfort of iheir own home6. Mean­
ing lhat not ju st court-authorized w iretaps, bu t 
Joe Schmoe w iretap s, would be possible. L et's 
hope not.This has been around for decades, and 
has nothing to do with com puters, but isn 't it 
nice?
You write with a pen attached by rods 
to a transm itter; somewhere e lse, a pen attached 
by ro d s lo a receiver duplicates what you have 
w ritte n .
What is being transm itted consists of the 
m easured sideways motion ("change ln x n) ,  the 
m easured up-and-dow n motion ("change in y " ), 
and the condition of the pen ("up" o r  "dow n"). 
What would these days be called "three analog 
channels, multiplexed on a 9ingle line."
These only cost a couple of hundred dollars. 
Why has nobody been using them for computer 
input?

Would you believe that the greatest avail­
able com puier serv ice ia for the kiddies?
F or four b ucks and a half, an outfit called 
Me-Books will sen d , to a child you designate, 
a story of which he is the h e ro , in which his 
friends an d  siblings ap p ear, and whose action 
involves his ad d ress and b irth d ay .
Kida adore it. C hildren who don’t like 
reading tre a su re  the volum es; children who do 
like read in g  love them Just as much.
1  can personally re p o rt, at least on the 
b asis of the one 1  ord ered  (My Friendly Giraffe) 
lhat th e story is beautifully thought out, warm, 
loving, and cleverly plotted. In other w ords, 
far from being a fast-buck schem e, this thing 
has b een  done rig h t. It's a splendid children's 
sto ry . (1 won't reveal th e plo t, but the G iraffe's 
b irth d a y , name and home a d d re ss are related 
to those of the pro tag o n ist.)
M oreover, it has th ree-co lo r illustrations, 
is on ex tra-heavy p ap er and is bound in hard
(In case y o u 're  in te re ste d , any of the 
three program m ing languages expounded earlier 
in the book would be suitable for creating a 
Me-Book: depending on th e language chosen, 
the holes left for the c h ild 's ow n name would be 
alphabetic v ariab les, segm ent gaps or null arrays
— anyhow , you could do i t .)
A stute read ers of lhe Me-Book will note 
that w hile il's not readily o b v io u s, only the lines 
on w hich personalized inform ation appear have 
been p rin ted  in the com puter's lin ep rin ter. The 
others have all been p re -p rin te d  on a p re ss. 
Indeed, the personalizations app ear on only one 
side of each page, the w hole book being one 
long w eb of p ap er th a t's r u n  through Ihe line­
p rin te r ju st once before b e in g  cut and bound.
But it’s so cleverly w ritten an d  laid oul that the 
story moves on beautifully even on the pages 
lhat d o n 't mention the c h ild 's name.

You will note that all bank checks now 
have funny-looking num bers along their bottoms. 
T hey go like this:
The num bers are odd but recognizable.
T he last four thingies are punctuation m arks, 
which presum ably can mean anything the pro­
grammer wants them to. (In other w ords, 
frankly, 1  d on'l know Iheir names o r standard 
functions.)
The name of these num bers is MIGA, 
which stands for Magnetic Ink C haracter Hecor- 
ding. They are printed in magnetic in k — nol 
magnetic so 's you could record on it, like mag­
netic ta p e , but chock ‘full of iron and vitamins 
so that as its blobs whiz pasl a special read 
head, Ihey cause a specific sequence of pulses 
in the parallel circuits of the read head thal can 
be decoded as Ihe specific num ber o r m ark.
The MICE system was designed in the 
late fifties, with the technology convenient al 
thal lime, and would certainly not be designed 
that way now. Nevertheless, these weird-looking 
symbols have inspired various
HIDJCUJ.DJS T V PE -FflC E S ,
which apparently look lo the public like the 
latest holcha whizbang zippity up-to-date futur­
istic stuff, even though to lhe knowledgeable 
person they bring back the lale fifties. (In 
fact there are no letters in the M1CR character- 
se t.)
What, I hen (you may ask) would symbols 
designed for computers look like if Ihey had 
been designed more recently?
W e w ere Jusl getting to th at. In feci, 
there are two 6ueh alphabets, called OCR (for 
Optical C haracter Recognition). They have 
been standardized so everybody can design 
equipment and/or program s to work with them. 
They are called the A and B optical Tonis, or, 
for completeness, OCR(A) and OCR(B).
They t2  very disappointing.
OCR (A) is a little sex ier. At least it 
looks like som ething. (Evidently it's slightly 
easier to deal wilh and design fo r.) Bul the 
other one. OCR(B), ju sl looks like the alphabet 
next door. Here they are.

In the nineteenth century, e pessimistic 
eeononlst named Thomas Malthus predicted thet 
there would always be starving people. because 
people Increased geom e tric a lly  expanding st 
compound Interest, with a Used rale of Increase 
creating an ever-Meeper growth-- while agricul­

This meant. Ualihus thought, thal there 
would always be the etarvlng poor. For verlous 
reasons ihls did not hsppen In Europe. Bul the 
regrettable soundness of the general principle 
persists: when ratea of food production can'l 
Marly keep up with rales of population growth, 
people are going lo etarve.
Thia Is basically the prediction.
DYNAM IC M ODELLING
Basically whal haa happened Is thia. One 
Jay Forrester, of MIT. has for some years been 
studying 'dynamic models" of things, a new 
breed of elmulation which couldn’t have been 
done without computers. And now dynamic 
models of the world's entire economic sysiem 
can be creeled and tried oul.
Basically dynamic models a n  mathematical 
complexes where things change al rates lhal 
change Ihemaelves over lime. For instance, the 
more you eat, the falter you get. and the fetter 
you get. the hungrier you are going lo be. Now, 
Juat because this Is simple lo ssy In words, and 
■aunde aa ihough mathematicians would have had 
aolved ihe whole class of problems centuries ago. 
that's not how II la. The Intricacy of auch 
models, even for Juat a few variablea. made It 
Impossible to foresee what happens In such com­
plexes e itc l by techniques of compuier enactment. 
Forrester, who has studied such systems since 
the fifties, haa become alert to their problems 
and surprlaes. The culmination of hla work has 
been a model of Ihe entire world's economic 
growth, agriculture, population. Industrialization 
and pollution; this Is described In his book 
World Dynamics (Wrlght-Allen. 1971).

PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
Now. it le important to clarify what is 
hsppenlng here and what Is nol. Whal Is not 
happening: an oracular pronouncement by "Ihc 
computer." showing some transcendental predic­
tion by a superhuman Intelligence. What is hap­
pening: people are trying out separate possible 
assumptions lo see whsl their consequences are, 
enacted by the compuier according to the economic 
rulea they sel up. Reeull: always Ihe same.
Any set of rules, played out in the unstable 
exploding-population world beyond the seventies, 
appears to have similarly dire results.
W HAT HOPE IS THERE?
The original model is only an approxima­
tion. and Ihe basic results, as published in The 
Limits to Growth (see box) reflect thoBc approx­
imations. One of the things that can be done is 
lo fill In and expand Ihe model more, to see 
whether any hopes can be found in the details 
and fine cracks which don'l appear from the 
groas results. And. of course, lo sludy and 
re-study ihe basic findings. (Por Instance, a 
small error waa recently found: a decimal poini 
was misplaced in the "pollution'’ calculation.  
leading lo an overstatement of Ihe pollution In 
some of Ihe runs. (But pollution, remember, is 
only part of Ihe problem.)
So there you are. This is a study of Ihe 
greatest Importance. W e may, Jusl may. be gel­
ling wind of things In lime lo change Ihe outcome. 
(If only we knew how. Bul again, this sludy 
Is where serious discussion must begin.)

(Keynote apeech, ACM 73. quoted
In Compuierworld. 5 Sep 73. p. 4.)Now begins the winter of the world.
W e are poisoning everything.
With so llllle time left, we are of course 
expanding and accelerating every form of pollution 
snd destruction.
W e are killing Ihe last of our beautiful 
brother*, the whalea. Jusl to provide marginal 
amortization of the whale-ahlpe that are going 
to be scrapped anyway.
Item: euppcsedly the Sahars Desert was 
mm-made,  II Is growing fast.
Sel down upon this beautiful planet, a 
garden spol of the universe, we are turning it 
Into a poisoned pigsty.
You and 1  may atarve lo death, dear reader. 
In some yesr fairly soon now,  sround the lum  of 
the century. there will no longer be nearly e- 
nough food for the teeming billions.
Thai, anyway, is whal the predictions Bay. 
The predictlona are compelling, nol becauae a 
computer made them -- anybody can make a com­
puter predict anything-- but because the prem­
ises from which Ihe predictions grow were 
very well thought out.
It is now up to us lo make Ihe predictions 
come out wrong.
Not by killing the bearer of bad tidinga. 
or by prelending they were not clearly stated—  
but by seeing whal possible alternatives remain 
in the few moments of real choice wc may yet 
have-- scant yeara at besi.
To haggle now aboul ideology Is like ar­
guing about who is driving while we arc headed 
toward a brick wall with Ihe gas pedal jammed 
lo the floor.
The public Ihlnks, "science will save us." 
a view al which many scientists snicker bitterly. 
Perhaps we will be shrunk lo an Inch'a height, 
or fed on rocks, or given gills and super-kldneys 
lo live in the ever-more-poisoned sea. Or per- 
hapB we will do whal science says others have 
done: die out.
This science-wlll-save-us ostrich-poslllon 
is nicely exemplified by Albert Rosenfeld. Science 
Editor of Saturday Revlew/World.
Since ''science" has given us Ihe Boeing 
747 and Ihe neutrino, neither of which could 
once, he Ihlnks. have been imagined possible, 
obviously (to him) science can do anything else 
we Ihink is impossible! He fully imagines lhal 
science will come up wilh something lo lake 
care of geometrically increasing numbers of 
people. In pcrpetuily?
"Take a lesson from the neutrino." he 
says. "W e can solve our problems.” ("Look 
lo the Neutrino. Thou Doomsayer," Saturday 
Review/ World. Feb 23 1974, 47.)
OTHER FU N
The growing diffision of weapons and 
grudges, and the great vulnerability of almost 
everything, assuie lhal terrorism and political 
extortion will will increase dramatically for 
Ihe foreseeable future. On the other hand, 
whole economic blocs and industries have 
lately mastered and demonstrated by example 
how to hold Ihc country al bay in order to 
gel tf eil wishes: as everybody can sec what's 
happening, and learn from it, the number of 
wronching ul'pleasanlr.csses created by terrorists 
and industries und interest blocs will irercjisi .
All these were CHbcntiully foreseen by 
Thomas C. Schelling in his masterly i960 work. 
The Strategy of Conflict. Schelling formalizes 
a theory of intimidation as pari of his sludy of 
communicating adversaries. (His is a structural 
rather lhan a psychological sludy. examining 
Ihe properties of situations whether or nol Ihoy 
are psychologically perceived. Regrettably, 
perception of situations is improving all iho
Cousteau says Ihe oceana are dying 
a lot faster than he anticipated 
-- and gives mankind fifty years 
after life ends Ihere.
Bul even if everything else were all right, 
the Breeder Reactors are sure to gel us. 1  refer
lo those wonder machines lhal Ihe electric com­
panies are calling Clean Energy for the Future. 
Whal ia nol explained with such slogans is that 
breeder reaciors nol only create energy, they 
create atomic waate. breeding new fiaslonable 
malarial-* including plutonium. Plutonium ia 
well named for the ged of hell. Chemically a 
poison and radloacllvely a horror, il does nol 
go away; wherever we pul il. it will get back
The mere radiation from ihe atomic crap 
is hardly the problem. The radioactive poisons 
are getting Into the oceana. They are getting 
Into Ihe clean waiers of the land. (A December 
1973 newa report, for Inslsnce. revealed lhal 
a 1968 lesk of redloactlve chemicals was inlo 
the water aupply of Bloomfield, Colorado.) Now. 
atomic enthusiasts call ii a Disposal Problem, 
like the question of where to bury the garbage. 
But It's a very different problem. Wherever we 
pul It. It will come back. The see? No. that'll 
be poisoned alter the containers go. Deep wells? 
The mountains? But Ihere is no place thal can­
not be guaranteed against earthquake and re* 
cycling. It will come back. Though dozens of 
generations mlghl survive ll, ii will be wailing.But the breeder reactors multiply ihls 
output. Perhaps we could survive Ihe ihe waste 
for a few hundred yeara. till ii comes back out.
But the other part of ll is the fissionable material 
which can be made into backyard bombs.
Thai's the kicker. Wilh more and more 
fissionable crud being disgorged, Ita availability 
(or terrorists who want lo build ihelr own In­
creases. Ralph Lapp pointed out last year lhat 
the stud was shipped In unguarded trucks, and 
one or two good hijackings would enable any 
bright kid to build his own dirty A-bomb. By 
the year 2000 it is not inconceivable ihei bootleg 
atomic weapons will be as widespread as hand­
guns in Detroit-- and as much used.
But now. with the breeder .reactors-- ir. 
lots of countries-- pouring the stuff out, the era 
of atomic plenty Is here. The smaller countries 
who wanl them are gelling Ihelr atomic weapons 
-- though holding back assembly of the parts, 
for vsrlous reasons. It la generally believed 
among bomb-watchers, for Inatance. thal India 
and Israel have theirs anytime they warn.
Add this to the great avalanche of mlasilee. 
tall and hom y In Ihelr slloa, ready to go on two. 
laier three or four, sides. (The U.S. official 
arsenal now stands at Ihe explosive equivalent 
of S  billion tone of TNT. a ton of TNT for every 
human being. And that's Jusl the explosive part, 
nol ihe fallout: a fraction of these bombs could 
destroy all life on earth by Us seething residue.) 
And now. because of the SALT lalks. we may 
expeci a new and drastic Increase of this Readiness 
Posture. Koo boy. Whal Is there li sny.
So there It ia. folka. merry times ahead. 
Humanity may end with a bang (thermonuclear 
exchanges, or jusl desultory firings urlll we're 
all poisoned or sterile), or a whimper (universal 
slbrvaiion). or. I would anticipate, some spaailc 
combination of Ihe two. and all within Ihe (pos­
sible) lifetime of Ihe average reader. This is, 
al sny rale, what I  think most likely.
Except of course we won't see It happen 
thal way. We'll watch Ihe starvations on TV 
(aa we did Blafra. Bangladesh, now West Africa, 
wliai n e x t... India?), and isk aboul ihe poor 
foreigners who can'l take care of ihemaelves.
And as Ihe problems Increase and move toward 
ouv heartland, it'll be blamed on envlronmentallats 
and on Ihe news media, till bang.
Or maybe not. Just maybe.
But we've all got lo grl occcss lo the Club 
of Home models, and look for holes or strategies.
If compulcr modelling systems doing this kind of 
work are made widely enough available, perhapa 
some precocious gradc-schooler or owlish hobbyist 
will find some way out lhat Ihe others hsven't

We've gol to ihink hard about everything.

A ll r ig ilt e  r e s e rv e d .Technology is in  expression « f  man's dreams. If man did 
H»t Indulge M s fifrtaSl^T. Tils thoughts alone Mould In h ib it the 
development of technology I ts e lf . Ancient v isio n arie s spoke of 
d ista n t times and places, where men flew around and about, and 
some could see each other at great distan ce. The technological 
r e a liti e s  of today are already obsolete and the future of 
technology is  bound only by the lim its of our dreams. Modern 
communications media and in p a rticu la r e lec tro n ic  media are 
outgrowths and extensions of those senses which have become 
dominant in our social develoiment.
Hoo W achB presa, "Hy{.e  r-.~ea i i ti<. "
This is the (lip aide o t Computer L ib,
(Peel free io begin here. The other side 
Is just If you wanl to know more about com puters,  
which a re  changeable devices for tw iddling sym­
bols. O therw ise skip it.)
(But If you change your mind It might 
be fun lo b r o w s e .)
In a sen ae. the oth er aide has been a 
come-on for this aide. But it's an honest come- 
on: 1 figure the more you know, the readier 
you'll be for w hat I'm aaying here. Not neces- 
sarlly to ag ree o r be nao ld .n  but to think aboul 
il In Ihe non-eim ple term s lhat are going lo be 
n ecessary .
T he m aterial here has been chosen largely 
for Ita exhilaratin g  and inspirational ch aracler.
No matter whal y o u r background or technical 
know ledge, y o u 'll be able to understand some of 
thia, and not be able to understand aome of the 
rest. T h at's p artly  from the hasty preparation 
of Ihis book, a n d  partly from Ihe variety of In­
terests I'm try in g  to com prise here. I want to 
present various dream s and Ihelr resulting dream 
machines, all legitim ate.
If Ihe com puier Is a projective system , or 
Rorschach Inkblot. ae alleged on Ihe other sid e ,  
the real projective sy stem s-- Ihe ones with p ro ­
jectors in them -- are all Ihe more so. The things 
people try  to do with movies, TV and the more 
glamorous uses of the computer, w hereby it makes 
pictures on sc re en s— are strange Inversions 
and foldovers of the rest of the mind and heart. 
That's Ihe p eculiar origam i of Ihe self.
Very w ell. T his book-- this sid e, Dream 
Machines- ■ is meant to lei you see the choice 
of dream s. Noting that every company and uni- 
verslty seems to Insist thal Its system is the 
wave of the fu tu re, I think il la more Important 
lhan ev er to have Ihe alternatives spread out 
c lea rly .
But the "ex p erts" are not going lo be much 
help; they are p art of the problem . On both 
aldea, the academic and Ihe in dustrial, they are 
being painfully pontifical and bombastic In the 
ja rrin g  new Jargons (see "Babelfa in Toyland," 
p. *7 ). Little clarity la spread by this. Pew 
thlnge are funnier lhan Ihe pretensions of those 
who profess to dignity, sobriety and profession­
alism of th eir ex p ert predictions’ -- especially 
when they, loo a re  p ouring oul th eir own personal <  
vlewa u n d er the guise of technicality. Most peo­
ple don't dream of w hat's going lo hit the fan.
And the com puier and electronics people are like 
generals p rep a rin g  for Ihe last w ar.
F ran k ly , 1  think it'a an outrage making it 
look as If th e re 's  any kind of scientific baala to 
these things: th ere ia an underlevel of technicality.  
but like the foundation of a cathedral, it serv es 
only to supp o rt what riaes from It. THE TECH­
NICALITIES MATTER A LOT, BUT THE UNIFYING 
VISION MATTERS MORE.

Tills hook has several slnul t,in«.-ous Intvn- 
clons: co o rient ihe beginner In field s norc 
complex and tied together than almost anybody 
re a liz e s; nevertheless, co p a rtia lly  debunk 
several realos o( expertise which I chink de­
serve slig h tly  less atten tio n than they get; 
and to chart the right way, which I think uniquely 
contInues the Western trad itio n s of lite ra tu re , 
scholarship and freedom. In th is respect che 
book Is much more old-fnshoned lhan It may soon 
at the gee-whlz, vory-nov level.
The main Ideas of ih ls book I present nol 
aii m y own, buc js  ,1 curious species of revealed 
tru th . Ii has .ill been obvious to cie for some 
tin e , and I bellev.- It should he obvious as well 
to anyone who has not been blinded by education.
If you understand the problems of creative think­
ing and organizing ideas. If you have seen che 
had things sehool so often does to people, If 
you understand che sociology of che In tellectu al 
world, and have ever loved a machine, then this 
book says nothing you H n  not know already.For every dream . many details an d  in tri­
cacies have to be whittled and in terlocked. T heir 
joint ramifications muat be deeply u n d erstood by 
Ihe person who is trying to create w h alev e r-lt'is. 
Each confabulation of possibilities tu rn s out to 
have the most Intricate and exactly detailed results. 
(This is why I am so irritated by those who think 
"electronic media" are all alike.)
And each possible combination you choose 
h as different precise stru ctu res implicit in it, 
arrangem ents and units which (low from theae 
ramified details. Implicit in Radio lu rk  the 
Time Slot and the Program. But many of these 
possibilities remain unnoticed or u n se en , for a 
variety of social or economic reasons.
Why does il matter?
II matters becauee we live In m edia, as 
fish live in water. (Many people are priso n ers 
of the media, many are m anlpulatora, and many 
wanl to uae them to communicate artistic v isio n s.)
But todayi al thia moment, we can and m jat 
d esign Ihe media, deaign the molecules of our 
new w ater, and I believe Ihe details of thia design 
matter very deeply. They will be w ith us for a 
v e ry  long time, perhsps as long as man has left; 
p erhaps if they are as good aa they can b e . man 
may even buy more lim e'- or the open-ended 
future most suppose rem ains. (See "E ndgam e,”
P. t *  .)
So in theae pages I hope to o rient you some­
what to various of the proposed d rea m s.  Thia ia 
meant also to record the efforts of a few Brewster 
McClouds, each tinkering toward some new flight 
of fancy in his own sensoarium.
But bear in mind that h ard-edged fantasy 
i6 Ihe corner of tomorrow. The great American 
dream  often becomes the great American novelty. 
After which it's a choice of style, size sn d  fin­
ancing plan.
The most exciting things here a rc  those 
thal involve computers: notably, because compu­
te rs will embraced in every preaentational medium 
and thoughtful medium very soon.
T hat's why this aide ia wedded lo Ihe other: 
if you wanl to understand com puters. you can take 
the first step by turning the book o v er. 1 figure 
that the more you know about com puters— especial­
ly about minicomputers and Ihe way o n-line sy s­
tems can respond to our slightest a cts-- the better 
y o u r imagination can flow between Ihe technicali­
ties, can alide the parts together, can d iscern Ihe 
shapes of what you would have these things do.
T he computer is nol a limitless p a rtn e r, bul 1 1  is 
deeply versatile; to work wilh il we muat under­
stand what ll can do, the options and the costs.
My special concern, all too lightly framed 
here, is the use of computers lo help people 
w rite, think and show. Bul I think preaenistlon 
b y computer is a brsnch of show b is and writing, 
nol of psychology, engineering or pedagogy.
T his would be Idle disputation if It did nol have 
far-reaching consequences for the desig n s of the 
sysiem s we are all going to have to live with.
Al w o rst,  I  fear these may lock us in; at b e st.
I hope Ihey can further the individualistic tradi­
tions of literature, film and scholarship. Bul 
we musl create our brave new w orlds with a rt. 
zest, intelligence, and Ihe highest possible ideal 6.
I  have nol mentioned the emotions. Movie 6  
and books. music and even architecture have for 
all of us been part of important emotional moments. 
T he same i 6 going lo happen with Ihe new media.
To work al a highly responsive com puter display 
screen , for Instsnce. can be deeply exciting, 
like flying an airplane through a canyon, or 
talking to somebody brilliant. Thia is aa it 
should be. ("The reason is. and by lig h ta ought 
to be, slave lo Ihe emollona." -- B ertrand Russell.)
In Ihe design o r our future media and sy s­
tems, we should not shrink from this emotional 
aspect ss a legitimate part of our fantic (see p.
) design. The substratum of technicalities 
and (he mind-bending, gut-alammlng effects Ihey 
produce, are two sides of the same coin; and lo 
understand the one is nol necessarily to be 
alienated from the other.
Thus il Is for Ihe Wholiness of the human 
sp irit, thal we musl design.

Since the f o r tie s , there have been continual 
announcements th a t video d isk s— movies you play 
on your TV o f f  a record— were r ig h t around the 
corner. E a rlier th is  year they were supposedly 
going to be av ailab le before Christmas. Now they
nig h t be on sa le, "on a lim ited b a sis,"  in  1976.
(T V  Guide, 1$ Aug 75, p . 7.) Because of the grave 
d if f ic u ltie s  of e ngineering-- inaccuracies in pun­
ching the center hole mean the track can’t  help 
being o ff c en te r, fo r Instance— sane of us are 
sk e p tic al.
T w o systems have been confidently announced. 
P h ilip s, the firm th at gave ua the audio c asse tte , 
has a systaa th a t w ill follow  tha sp ir a l track on 
the disk fran underneath w ith a la se r. The disk 
tu rn s a t  30 rev o lu tio n s per second, or one turn 
per T V  frame, so i t  can supposedly freeze On one 
frame when desired .
The o th er sy sta a  i s  from rca , which has 
a long h isto ry  of me-too announcements, but a t 
le a s t two of them made i t  big  (the 45 record and 
the co lo r TV sy staa now used in  th e  USA), so R C A  
should not be dism issed o u t of hand. Their disk 
ey stm  w ill supposedly go a t  450 rp s (7.5 re v o l­
u tio n s / second) ,  b u t they s t i l l  mean to  track i t  
with a needle.  The man from TV Guide says h e 's 
seen I t  and I t w r k l  p e rf e c tly , bu t I 'would p e r­
sonally look fo r hidden wires.
(M C A , an entertainm ent conglomerate, has 
hitched up w ith P h ilip s and p rin te d  a catalog of 
a l l  the sovies they w ill supposedly make a v ailab le  
on disk for the "MCA-Phllips" system— Huch as 
Destry Rides Again fo r around ten bucks. This is  
probably ju s t a b lu ff) w ith  th o  p ric e  of audio 
records what they are, no way i s  a movie going to
c o st ten bucks- But i t  makes R C A  look weaker,
which is  probably the purpose.)
The p rospect su rp rised  then, b u t M A G I (see 
p. D M 36) allow s aa how they might le t  you make 
movies on th e ir over-the-phone movie-making setup 
(sketched on p . DM36). P rie s to capable out- 
d e rs, i f  the softw are meshed, would be about $50 
an hour. (Six hours makes one minute of film , 
not counting th e phone b i l l .  Cheap i f  you know 
movie e c o im ic s .)
Meanwhile, John l^>wry, a t  D ig ita l Video Lab­
o ra to rie s in  Toronto, has been developing high- 
q u a lity  video s u ita b le  fo r tran sfer to th e a tric a l 
film . He and they have developed a 655-line 
color e y s t« — w ith heavy d ig ita l enhancsttnt 
(aee "Picture P ro cessin g ,* p. DM10). I  scarcely 
believe By no tes, bu t I saw I t ,  and wrote down 
th a t i t  was comparable to 35aaa stu d io  co lo r.
The day of " electro n ic cameras"— th at i s ,  film - 
q u a lity  video-- may be upon us soon.
AtDUt 1972, there wae announced an e lec tro n ­
ic ally -c o n tro lle d  color f i l t e r  th a t could chareje 
to  any hue in  nanoseconds. That would to  ju s t 
■h a t we a ll need fo r colo r movies fro a 03Ms— 
but what happened to  it?M illions of people saw conputer graphics for 
the f i r s t  time on the PBS ‘Accent of Man" se rie s, 
where a screen drawing o f E arly  Man's sk u ll was 
seen to  r o ta te  and grad u ally  change in  i t s  fea­
tu res. This waa s ta r tlin g  even i f  you know about 
computer graphics, since it seoaed to be proceed­
ing frcsn complex data concerning the e n tire  
sk u lls and th e ir changes.
Not so. A ctually what you saw was a series 
o f sk u ll drawings by Pater Foldes, a P arisian 
a r t i s t ,  with the coaputer generating tr a n s itio n a l 
drawings between than. (Indeed, though you saw 
Prof. Bronowskl next to  the sc re en , you did not 
see him next to the screen a t th e same time the 
drawings were changing— because th a t had to  be 
filmed very slowly.)
The systao was created  by Nestor Burtnyk and 
M arcelll Hein, o f the N ational Research Council 
of Canada. I t  currently runs only On an SEL 840A. 
( I t was a lso  used by the N ational Film Board o f

Thought you might wonder.Persons of sagacity have been saying for 
some time lhat we are meierieliaUc.
In an Important sense this la not so.
The machines, and toys, and Involvementa 
wa buy Into, are In but a small proportion of 
cases owned simply aa scores, for their eoet 
as consumption symbols.
Rather, we buy things lhat REPRESENT 
IDEALS,  hoping ourselves lo partake of some 
abstraction or Image-- the Playboy roan, the 
Smart Businessman, the Clever Homemaker.
Each product tries to tell ua It Is lha key­
stone of a way of life, and Ihen, at least at that 
moment of purchase, we step Into, we embrace 
thal Way of Ufa, covering ourselves wilh tha 
feeling, the aura, the magic we saw In Ita  com­
mercial .
This Is not materialism.  It la wishful 
grasping st mi asm a. (Following sentence op­
tional.) It la communion, with the object seized 
simply ihe Objective Correlative of a hoped-for 
transaubslandatlon. (Sorry.) It’s  a seeking, 
not to possess,4  to belong.
D.W. GRIFFITH-- look the movle-box and crested 
the photoplay, no longer a twisted stage 
production.
WALT DISNEY—  created a hypnotic pantheon of 
kindly and Innocent semi-animals. senti­
mentally universal, generally acceptable.
JOHN W. CAMPBELL-- aa author and then editor 
of Astounding,  turned American acience- 
flction from Ihe Buck Rogers spsce Opera 
lo the human sto ry , built around thought - 
out premises and stru ctu res.
IVAN SUTHERLAND-- programmed and syatematlzed 
a computer setup for helping people think 
and work with deeply-slruclured plclorlal 
Information. (See p.)b,Zj.)
DOUG ENGELBART-- foresaw the use of computer

ANOTHER QUICKIE
Compare Alice, when she gets to Wonderland 
("Deary me! Curioser and curioser’") 
with Dorothy Gale, transported to Oz
("How do I get back to Kansas?!!!") 
Fantasy ties In with everything, including 
American gil-oul-n-do-H.I  already said on the other side that the 
compuier Is a Rorschach, and you make of It 
some wild reflection of what you are yourself. 
There is more lo It lhan thal.
America is the land where the machine Is 
an intimate part of our fantasy life.
Germans are too literal, they csn get off 
on well-oiled cogs. The French are loo vague,
(I've noticed that German Bclence-flclion maga­
zines had covefB of machines and planets; French 
science-fiction magazines, of dragons and people 
with w ings. Our sclence-flctlon covers show 
people with mschlnes. Intimately, emotionally.) 
German fantasy la Icy end Impersonal, French 
fantasy loo personal, and American fantasy le 
aplat in  the middle, uniting both: man and 
machine, means and ends, emotion and details.
Men always longed to fly, bul It was here 
lhat they first did, This Is the land of Ihe 
MOVIE.  a fantasy fabricated with endless diffi­
culty using various kinds of equipment.
The mad tinkerer is a fabled character 
In our fiction.
T his is the land of the kandy kolor hot 
rod, the Hell's Angel chopper, the drive-in 
movie. And the wild hot-rod, In fact, la jusl 
Ihe flip side of the deep-carpeted Cadillac: each 
l£ a fantasy. an extension of Ita owner's image 
of himself in the world,
Thus It was nol an historical accident, 
but utterly predetermined, lhal In the hands of 
Americans the computer would become s way of 
realizing every conceivable wild fantasy thal 
was dear lo them.
T his is perfectly all right, This Is as It 
should be. This is the beat part of our cuHure- 
Not "Let a hundred flowers bloom.* but "Let a 
hundred gizmos clank." This has sped Immeas- 
ursbly the Imaginative development of many dif­
ferent things we might wanl.  I try here fairly 
to explain a few differences among them.
There Is Juat one problem with all thls.
Now that all these things exist, or come nearer 
to existing, which ones will other people want?
What will it be possible for everyone to have?
And how can we tie all these things together?

with educators, publishers and others has been 
the respectful Imitation of computer ways by 
those who didn't quite understand them. Again, 
the cargo cult.*
The most dismal of these practices has been 
the adoption of the term "software" for any intel­
lectual or artistic property .** This wholly loses 
the distinction, made on the other side of the book,  
between:
hardware (programmable equipment)
software (programs, detailed plans 
of operation lhat the hardware 
carries out)
contents or data (material which is 
worked on by, moved in or 
presented by the hardware 
under control of the software)
In other w ords, hardware and software 
together make sn environment; data or contents 
move and appear in that environment.
The publishing-and-picturefolk have missed 
thle distinction entirely. Not realizing that their 
productlona are the contents (material, matter, 
dala, stuff, m essage...) that come and go in the 
prefabricated hardware-software entlronments, 
they have mushed this together into a state of 
self-feeding confusion.
(The matter has not been helped by the 
computer-assisted instruction people— see p . D M  I  5
— whose branching productions seemed to them 
enough IJke computer programs lo be called 
"software.")

Everything 
Else3. STANDARDIZATION "The Emperor has no clothes on!"
In order for something to Catch On, it has 
to be standardized. Unfortunately, there is mo­
tivation for different companies to make their own 
little changes In order to restrict users to Its 
own products. The best exsmple of how to 
avoid this: Philips patented its audio cartridge 
to the teeth, but then granted everybody free 
use of the patent provided they adhered to the 
exact standardization. The result has been the 
system's spectacular success, and Philips, rather 
than dominating a small market, has a share of 
a far larger market, and hence makes more 
money. That's a virtue-rewarded kind of story.
The other problem with standardization, 
though, is that we tend to standardize too soon.
W e standardized on A M  radio, even though FM  
would probably have been better. (One Major 
Armstrong, a great figure in the development 
of radio, committed suicide when nobody would 
accept FM. If he could only have heard our FM  
of today, he might h a ^  said "Oh. nuts," and 
lived.)
Another example. When they designed the 
Touch-Tone phone pad. the Bell people evidently 
saw no reason to have ll match the adding ma­
chine panel, so they put " 1" in the upper left 
rather than (he lower lefl. Now there are lols 
of people who use both arrangements, every day, 
and at least one of them curses lhe designers' 
lack of consideration.
Another interesting example of Catching 
On: during the early sixties, it was fun being 
at places where they were jusl getting Xerox 
copiers for the first time. Everyone would ar­
gue that nobody needed a copier. Then, grud­
gingly, one would be ordered. The first month's 
use invariably would exceed the estimate for the 
first year, and go up and up from there.
The worst aspect of the confusion among 
the corporations ie that certain deficiencies and 
crudities of vision slip into the mix. Unless 
our new media and Iheir exact ramifications and 
concomitants are planned with the greatest care, 
everybody stands to lose. W e must understand the 
detailed properties of media. (The first question 
to ask. when somebody is showing you the 
Latest and Greatest, is; "What are the properties 
and qualities of the medium?" The followup 
questions come easily with experience: How of­
ten do you have to change It, what are the bran­
ching options, what part could somebody acci­
dentally put in backwards, are there distracting 
complications? etc. )
1  am unpersuaded by McLuhan. His in­
sights are remarkable, yet suspicious: he sup­
poses thal electronic media are all lhe same. How 
can thia be? Here we may now decide what elec­
tronic media we want in lhe future-- and this de­
cision , I would say, is one of lhe most important 
we have lo face.
The engineers seem to be quite the oppo­
site of McLuhan: somehow to them it's always a 
multiple-choice, mulll-engineerlng problem, dif­
ferent every time; "this technique is good for A, 
that technique is good for B." But the net ef- 
fecl is the same: "electronic media are generally 
the same." I would claim that the're all differ­
ent, all ten million of them (TV being only one 
electronic medium out of the lot), and the dif­
ferences matter very very much, and only a few 
can catch on. So it matters very much which.
Some are great, some are lousy, some are sub­
tly bad, having a locked-ln information structure, 
built deep-down into the system. (Example: 
the fixed "query modes" built into some system s.)
One last point. Everybody only has a 
24-hour day. Most people, If they increase con­
sumption of one medium (like magazines or books) 
will cut down on anolher (like TV). This d ras­
tically reduces the sorts of growth some people 
have been expecting. Except, now, if we can 
begin to replace some of the Inane paper-ahuffllng 
and paper-losing of the business world, and 
replace lhe creepy activitlea of the school (as now 
generally constituted) with a more golden use of 
time and mind. Read on.Small Boy

Last year I actually heard a phone company 
lecturer say that in the future we 
will have "Instant Access to Anything, 
Anytime, Anywhere."
What they're pushing ie Picturephone, which 
it seems to me is unnecessary, wasteful 
and generally unfeasible.

when somebody shows you an electronic or other 
presentational system, device or whatever.
A certain kind of slight-of-hand goes on. 
It's very easy to get fooled. They may show 
you one thing and persuade you you've seen 
another.
And if you're canny enough lo ask about 
a feature you haven't seen they'll always say,
"WE'RE W ORKING ON IT."
It's only dishonest if ihey say. "It'll be ready 
next monlh."

RADAR DISPLAY u ses a CRT to show reflec­
ted images around where the radar 
antenna is standing. Thia u ses a 
scanning ra ste r of a star shape, 
brightening the beam when reflected 
images are received.
COMPUTER CRT GRAPHICS generally use 
the CRT in still another way; the 
beam is moved around the screen in 
straight lines from point to point. 
(Between different parts of the pic­
tu re the beam is darkened, turned 
v ery  low so you don'l see it.)
B ecause the image on a normal 
CRT fades quickly, the computer must 
ordinarily draw the picture again and 
again and again. (Methods for this 
a re discussed on p . pH £2*5.)
SPECIAL KINDS OF CATHODE-RAY TUBES
The CRT is not merely a single invention, 
but an entire family of inventions. The ordinary 
CRT, which we have discussed, is.view ed at one 
end by a human b eing, has an image which fades 
quickly, and can have its flying spot driven in 
any kind of ra s te r o r pattern.
Here are some other kinds of CRT:
The picture transm itter, which has different 
versions and names: Vidicon, Image Orth icon, 
Plum bicon. etc . THIS IS THE MAGICAL DEVICE 
THAT MAKES THE TELEVISION CAMERA WORK. 
AND YET, BY GOSH, IT'S JUST ANOTHER CRT. 
Except Instead of the picture coming into it as 
an electrical signal and out of it as an optical 
image, the picture comes into it as an optical 
image and goes out of it as an electrical signal:
How can this be?
The tube sits Inside ths television camera-, 
which is an ord in a ry  camera, like, With a lens 
projecting a picture through a dark chamber 
onto a sensitive surface. But Instead of the 
surface being a film , the surface is the faceplate 
of a CRT with some kind of a special pickup
phosphor:
T V
T he electron beam , which is just like any 
other electron beam , is made to zigzag across 
the faceplate in a standard television raster.
And the special phosphor of the tube measures 
the brightness of the picture at the spot the 
beam is hitting. I have no idea how this hap­
pens. but it's  chemical and electronical and mys­
terious, and is based on the way the phosphor 
interacts with the light from erne side and the 
electrons from the other side at the same time. 
Anvhow. a m easurement signal comes out of the 
faceplate, indicating how bright the projected 
p icture is in the very  spot the electron beam is 
now hitting.As the beam criss-crosses the faceplate in 
the zig-zag television raster, then, a continuously 
changing output signal from the faceplate shows 
the brightnesses all across lhe successive lines 
of the scan.
And that is the television signal. Together 
with synchronizing Information, it's what goes 
out over the airw aves, down your antenna and 
into your set. Your set, obeying-the.synchron­
izing information, brightens and darkens its own 
beam in proportion to the brightness of the 
individual teeny regions of the faceplate in the 
television cam era. And this produces the scin­
tillating surface we call television.
The color tube is a weird beast indeed. 
There are several types, but we'll only talk 
about the simplest (and many think the b e s t) ,  
Sony's Trinilron(TM ) tube.
This is an ordinary CRT which h as, in ­
stead of a uniform coating on the faceplate, tiny 
vertical strip es of three primary colors— re d , 
blue and g reen. (You thought the primary col­
ors were re d , blue and yellow, didn't you. If 
you're mixing pigments that happens lo be true. 
For some ungodly reason, however, if you're 
mixing lig h ts, the colors that yield all others 
turn out to be re d , green and blue; it tu rn s out 
that yellow light can be made oul of red and 
green. If you don't believe me go to a chintzy 
hardw are sto re, get a red and a green b ulb, 
turn 'em on and see what happens in a white- 
walled room.)
At any ratp, color television uses addi­
tional color signals, and in the Trinitron these 
control the response of the faceplate. If the 
color signal says "green" as the electron dot 
crosses a certain part of the screen, the color 
signal tells the green stripes lhat they're free 
to light up when hit. If it's Yellow Time, the 
signal tells both the red stripes and the green, 
and so side by side they light up red and g re e n ,  
as the beam crosses lhem, but the total effect 
from more lhan a few inches is Yellow.
Most American color TV sets, how ever, at 
least up till this year, used something very dif* 
ferent, something entirely weird called the 
Shadow Mask T ube. I'll spare you the p icture, 
but there were several different electron beams
— often referred to jokingly as the "red electron 
beam," "blue electron beam" snd "green electron 
beam," though of course they were identical in 
character. T hese hit a perforated sieve, up 
near the screen, called the shadow m ask, and 
the color signal tweaked the unwanted beams 
so they did not hit different-colored phosphor 
dots that w ere intricately arranged on the screen. 
I’m sorry I started  to explain this.
Multi gun tubes have more than one electron 
gun and more than one electron beam. They 
can be used in different ways (aside from the 
old shadow-mask TV tube, mentioned above).
For instance, one gun can be driven in a 
video ra ste r, lo show television, while another 
gun can be used as a computer display, draw ing 
individual lines with no regard to the TV pattern.The storage CRT comes in two flavors: 
viewable and non-viewable. But what it does 
is very neat: it holds the picture on the screen. 
The mechanisms for this are of various ty p es,  
and it's all weird and electronic, but the idea 
is that once something is put on the screen by 
the electron beam, it stays find stay s. Up to 
several minutes, usually. The main manufac­
tu re rs are Tektronix, Princeton Electronic Pro­
ducts, and Hughes Aircraft; each of ihese ihree 
has a product that works by a different melhod.
Note: Tektronix' tube built into a num­
b er of different computer displays, and is rec­
ognizable by its Kelly green surface. They 
themselves make complete computer terminals 
around this scope for $4000 and u p , bul lots of 
other people put it in their products also. It 
shows w hatever has already been put on the 
screen, and the electron beam does not have to 
repeat the action. However, it usually only 
stays lit for about a minute.
Princeton Electronic Products (guess where) 
is a much smaller outfit, so perhaps it is appro­
priate that they make a much sm aller storage 
tube. It is about one inch square at its storage 
end, and you don't look at it directly. Instead, 
an image can be stored on it either wth a TV 
raster or by computer-driven line draw ing.
After the image is stored on it, though, it func­
tions as a TV camera: the picture stored on the 
plate can be read out with a scanning raster, 
exactly as if it were a picture transm itter in a 
television camera. The Princeton folks have 
built a quite expensive, bul quite splendid, 
complete terminal around this device: it can hold 
both video and computer-drawn pictu re s, super­
imposed o r combined, and sends them back oul 
in standard black-and-white TV. $12000.
CRTS which bring in a picture one way 
(such as a video raster) and send it back out 
another way (such as by letting a computer 
search out individual points) are called scan 
converters.
A word about this last method. It is often 
desired by computer people to turn a picture 
into some form of data (see p. )(_,). Scan conver­
ters, usually by the three m anufacturers named 
above, can be hooked up to let the computer pro­
gram poke around in the picture and measure the 
brightness of the picture in arb itrary  places.
A device which examines the brightness of some­
thing in arbitrary places is called a flying spot 
scan n er. ) Here are some different kinds of 
Oying-spot scanners:
yiA c.0 i f a l f  it v
I have heard it said that it might be pos­
sible to build a CRT with a changeable mirror 
surface: that is, the screen becomes mirrored 
temporarily where it is being hit with the elec­
tron beam. Interesting. This would mean that 
you could make computer displays (and TV) 
bright and projectable to any degree, ssy , by 
pouring a super-lntensity laser beam on it. "Be 
great for writing 'Coca-Cola' on the moon,'1  says 
a friend of mine. If you believe in astral pro­
jection .

In a r e l a t e d  tren d , numerous d e s ig n  groups 
are a tte m p tin g  to  extend the c a p a b i l i t i e s  o f the 
human body, by means of th ings v a rio u s ly  c a lle d  
possum s. w aldoes and t e l e f a c t o r s .
"Possums" (from L atin "I can") a re  devices 
to  a id  the handicapped in  moving, g ra s p in g  and 
c o n tr o llin g . Whatever motions the p erso n  can 
make a re  e le c t r o n i c a l l y  transposed to  w hatever 
realm  o f c o n tr o l is needed, such as ty p e w ritin g  
or gu id in g  a w h e e lc h a ir. ("Waldo" is  H e in le in 's

In the sp ace program, though, they c a l l  them

v e r ts  o r ad a p ts body movements by m a g n ific a tio n

meant to  be o p e ra te d  by people w ith normal f a c u l­

s tr e n g th : c ra d le d  in  a la rg e r t e l e f a c t o r  body, a 
man can p ic k  up immense lo ad s, as the movements 
o f h is  arms a re  converted to  the movements o f the 
g r e a te r  ro b o t arms.
T e le f a c to r s  can a lso  work from f a r ,  f a r  away. 
Thus a man s i t t i n g  in  a booth can c o n tr o l, w ith  the 
movements o f h is  own arms, the a r t i f i c i a l  arms of 
a ro b o t v e h ic le  on another p la n e t.

Then th e r e  are those who, lik e  How Wachspress 
(see n e a rb y ), want to  expand man's se n se s beyond 
the o rd in a ry , in to  new sensory realm s, by hooking 
him to  v a rio u s  e le c tr o n ic s .

I  originally hadn't intended to include any­
thing like thia ln the book, wanting It to be a 
family-style access catalog and all that, but this 
particular item seems fairly Important.
Remember how we laughed at the Orgasmo- 
iron ln Woody Allen's Sleeper? Well, it turns 
out not to be a joke.
An individual named How (not Howard) 
Wachspreas, electronicker-in-realdence at a San 
Francisco radio station, has been developing juat 
thal. except that he has more elevated purposes 
ln mind. The secret was broken to the world 
in Oul magazine earlier thle year; but Hefner, 
the publisher, evidently held back the more 
startling photographs of a model In electnmlcally- 
induced ecstaay.
Wachspress' devices transpose sound (aa 
audio signals) into feelings; you touch your 
body with an open-ended tube or other soft 
fixture attached to his device-- which in turn 
ie attached to a hi-fi.
The sensations, it is claimed, are pro­
found and moving. You may take them anywhere 
on your body; the effect la deeply relaxing and 
emotionally engroasing. Wachspress thinks he 
has reached an entire neurological system that 
wasn't known before, much like Olds' discovery 
of the "pleasure center" in the brain; he aees it 
as a new modality of experience and a general­
ization of music and touch.  That la the main 
point. "Hyper-reality" is where he ssys It gels 
you: a point curiously congruent with the author's 
own notions of hypertext and hypermedia aa ex­
tensions of the mental life.
Thia said, we can consider the prurient 
aspects of Wachspress' Audltac and Telelac devi- 
ces (which he intends to market In a couple of 
years as hi-fi accessories, b'gosh). When 
played with the right audio, in the right placea, 
and a good operator at the controla, they provide 
a sexual experience said to be of a high order.
Wachspress' work ties in interestingly with 
today's "awareness" movement, of which Esalen 
is the spiritual center, which holds that we have 
gotten oul of (ouch with our bodies, our feelings, 
our native perceptions. As such, the Wachapreas 
machines may be an unfoldlng-mechantsm for the 
unfeeling tightness of Modem Man-- as well as 
a less profound treatment for "marital difficulties" 
and Why-Can't-Johnny-Come-Lately.
Inscrutable San Francisco! Wachapreas 
gave a number of demonstrations of his devices 
in Bay Area churches, until he became disturbed 
at Immodest uses of the probe by female communi­
cants who had stood In line to try the machine.

"Picture processing" ia an important technology, 
largely separate from the reat of computer graphics.
It meana taking an incoming picture, usually a photo­
graph, and doing something to it. (Some now call this 
area “computer pictoricB.’1)
Flrat of all, there ia image enhancement. Thia 
meana taking pictures, dividing them into points whose 
brightness is separately measured,and then using spec­
ial techniques for making the picture better.  To 
people familiar with photography, this may seem im­
possible; to photographers it is a maxim that photographs 
always lose quality at each step. Nevertheless, various 
mathematical techniques such as Fourier Analysis (men­
tioned elsewhere) do just that, producing a new data 
structure improving on the original data. Surfaces ap­
pear smoother,  edges sharper.
(These techniques have been extensively used to 
clean up photographs sent back from our unmanned apace 
vehicles—  both those used exploring other planets and 
those spying on our own—  see Secret Sentries in Space.  
Bibliography.) %
Then there are recognizers—  programs that look at 
the data structure from sn Input picture, and try to 
discern the lines, corners and other features of the 
picture. (Uhile your eye lnstsntly sees these things, 
computers do not, and must look at the dots of a picture 
one'-by-one. How to analyze pictures In such tedious se­
quences Is no simple matter.)
For recognizing more complex objects in pictures—  
boxes, spheres, faces or whatever—  more complex struc- 
ture-analyzing programs are necessary. As the possibil­
ities of what might be in a picture Increase, these in­
creasingly become guessing programs. (This becomes a 
branch of artificial intelligence, a misleading term for 
a curious field, discuBsedonjANZ'fY.)
Numerous cooputer people think it la important to 
match up our computer graphic display systems (described 
Variously on this side of the book) to image input sys- 
tema. This 1s a matter of taste.

These various techniques are Intended to create re­
duced data structures, recording only the ’'most impor­
tant" data of the picture—  from which new and varying 
pictures may be created, reflecting the "true" structures 
originally shown in the initial picture. How much it's 
going to be possible to create these data structures 
from input pictures remains to be seen*, some of us think 
it’s not going to be generally worthwhile.

guage called TARPS (T w o-D im ensional A lpha- 
Num eric R aster P ictu re S y s te m ). T h is in tu rn  
led to EXPLOR (EX I'licit(ly p ro v id e d  2D P a tte rn s,) 
Local (neighborhood) O p e ra tio n s, and R an d o m -’

originality and g e n e ra lity — not only does it 
modify p ictu res a n d  s e rv e  as an a r tis t's  tool, 
but it h a s fascin atin g  p ro p e rtie s  as a com puter 
language and m ay ev e n  h av e applications in 
com plex sim ulations for technical p u rp o se s.
Since V an d erb eek , Knowlton has e n tered  
into a long and fru itfu l collaboration w ith Lillian 
S ch w artz, a talented a rtis t. T h e ir m any films 
have b een c le v e r, sta rtlin g  an d  pow erful. I 
m ust say that they grow  o n  you: I liked them at 
firs t, but w hen 1  saw five o r  six  in a row th is 
J a n u a ry , I found them  Just in c re d ib le . B ecause 
they a re  a b stra c t, and full o f fast-ch an g in g  
p a tte rn s and re v e rs a ls , they take some a d ju stin g  
to; bu t th e y 're  w orth se e in g  o v e r and o v e r.
EXPLOR may be thought of as a h ighly 
g en eralized  v e rsio n  of C onw ay’s game of Life 
(see p . 4 f  ) . You s ta rt w ith tw o-dim ensional

events as specified by the program m er.
EXPLOR, ru n n in g  w ithout external data, 
comes up with some ex tra o rd in a ry  snakeskin and 
Jack F rost p a tte rn s. But its uses in traffic 
sim ulation and vario u s o th e r stu d ies of p o p u ­

EXPLOR has obvious a rtistic  applications. 
Lillian Schw artz is u sin g  it extensively in  film- 
m aking. It’s now ru n n in g  on a m inicom puter 
feeding to a modified Sony T rin itro n  color TV.
(This color setup waa created  b y  Mike Noll 
and is described in a recent issu e  of the CACM, 
though only for black -an d -w h ite TV; the color 
is m ore recent. It sto res the color p ictu re as

Knowlton has used EXPLOR for teaching

Wish there were room to calk about plain 
regular audio here—  matters like "binaural" 
recording, and Why don't they make hi-fi systems 
based on a Grand Bus (see p M 2  )? But there’s 
no room here.
AUDIO AND COMPUTERS
People are occasionally still startled to 
hear thdt computers can make sound and music.
They can Indeed.
First of all, note that an Incoming sound Is 
a fluctuating voltage and can thus be turned Into 
a data structure, i.e., a string of measurements.
To make sound by computer is the obverse. If 
the coaputer can be set up to send out a string of 
measurments, these can be turned back into a fluct­
uating voltage, and thus make sounds.In the easiest case, the computer can just 
sefid back out the voltages It originally got in.
This is rather ridiculous—  using the computer 
just as a recording device—  but it's a clear and 
simple example.
The question after that is what next: how to 
have the computer make interesting streams'Joutput 
measurements, i.e., sounds and tones.
There are numerous methods we can’t go Into.
Max Mathews, at Bell Labs, has for years been doing 
music by computer; his current systea Is called 
GROOVE. Heinz von Foerster, at the University of 
Illinois (Urbana),  has been doing the same. An­
other lab at MIT has just gotten a PDP-11/45 (see 
p. *or the 8ame purpose.
(The problem is: can the computer keep up 
with the output rate needed to make music in real 
time? maybe the 11/45 can.)
Another approach is to relieve the computer 
itself from making the tones, and use other de­
vices-- music synthesizers—  for this, controlled 
by the computer. This is essentially the approach 
taken with General Turtle’s Music Box (see p. S”7 )► 
and at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Cen­
ter , where their RCA Mark II music synthesizer—  an 
immense one-of-a-kind jobbie—  is under more general 
computer control.

MUSICAL NOTATION
Note that the computer handling of musical 
notes, ae symbols, is another task entirely, 
closely resembling computer text handling (mention­
ed variously in the book). A high-power structur- 
ed-text system or Thinkertoy (see p.fi*ft5) is fine 
for storing and presenting written music.
And, of course, such stored musical notation 
(a data structure) can obviously be played by 
the hookups mentioned.SPEECH BY COMPUTER
You may have heard about various kinds of 
talking computer." Thia deserves some explanation.
Computers may be made to "talk" by various 
means. One la through an output device that
simply stores recordings of separate 
words or syllables, which the computer selects with 
appropriate timing. (Machines of this type have been 
sold by both IBM and Cognltronlce for a long time.)
A deeper approach ia to have the conputer synthe­
size speech from phonemes, or actually make the tones 
and noises of which speech is composed. These are 
very tricky matters. Bell Labs, and others, have been 
working on many of these approaches.
The real problem, of course, ia how to decide 
what to say.  (This was discussed under Artificial 
Intelligence, p. )
AUDIO ANALYSIS AND ENHANCEMENT
The problem of analyzing audio ia very like the 
problem of analyzing pictures (see p.f^iO), and indeed 
some of the same techniques are used. The audio goea 
into the computer as a stream of measurements, and 
the selfsame technique of Fourier Analysis is employed. 
This reduces the audio to a series of frequency measure­
ments over time—  but, paradoxically, loses little of 
the fidelity.
Once audio is reduced to Fourier patterns, it can 
be reconstituted in various ways: changed in tining and 
pitch independently, or enhanced by polishing techni­
ques like those used in image enhancement (see ).
This haa been done with great success by Tom Stock- 
ham at the University of Utah, who has reprocessed old 
Caruso records into improved fidelity. In the picture 
we see him with equipment of some sort and an old record.
(Stockhaa has been in the news lately, bb one of 
the panel puzzling over the notorious 18-Minute Gap.)
(The author has proposed the name Kitchensynctm ^  
for a system to synchronize motion pictures with "wild1  
sound recording l>y these means.)

SPEECH
1. SENTENCE GEN ERA TION
The p r o b l a  of coaputers speaking huaan languages— 
not to  be confused w ith coaputer languagea, pp. 15-25 and 
elsew here—  Is In cred ib ly  complicated. Ju a t because l i t t l e  
human tyk es s t a r t  doing i t  e ff o rtle s s ly , i t  is  essy to  aup- 
pose t h s t  i t ’s a b a s ic a lly  easy problem.
Ho way.
Only a in ce  the m id -fiftie s hss huaan language begun 
to be u nderstood. That waa when Noam  Chomsky discovered the 
inner s tr u c tu r e  of huaan languages: n aaely , th a t th e long 
(and complex) sentence constructions of language s r e  b u ilt 
out o f c e r ta i n  ex act o perations. Previous lin g u is ts  had 
sought to  c la a a lfy  the aentence e tru c tu res them selves; th is 
led  to  c o m p lex ities which Chomsky discovered were unneces­
sa ry . I t  i s  unnecessary to catalog sentence types them­
se lv es 'I f  we can sim ply is o la te , In ste sd , the exact p ro cess­
es by which thsy a re  genersted.
These pro cesses he called  transform ations (a term he 
borrowed from m athem atics). A ll uttecsn ces are cre ate d  froa 
c e r ta in  elem entary p ieces, called  k e rn e la . which a re  then 
chewed by tran sfo rm atio n s into surface s tr u c tu re s , th e 
f in a l u tte r a n c e s . Examples of kernela: The man liv e s  in  the 
house, The house is  w hite. Result of combining transform a­
tio n : The man liv e s in  the white house. K ernel: 1 go.
R esult o f p a s t- te n s e  transform ation: I want.
The moat Im portant finding, now, is  th a t the tr a n s fo r -  
matlons a re  c a r rie d  out In orderly sequences: any aentences 
can hava more tran e fo ra atlo n a  c arried  out on I t ,  a l l  adher­
ing to  th e  b a sic  r u le s , re su ltin g  in the moat complex sen­
tences o f sny language.
L in g u ists sin c e  then have confirmed Chomsky's con­
je c tu re , snd proceeded to work out the fundamental tr a n s ­
form ations of m ajor languages, including Engllah.
Now, one r e s u l t of a l l  th la  I s  th a t i t  tu rn s out to 
be e a s ie r  to  gen erate sentences In s language than to  un­
derstand them. Why? Becauae i t  is  comparatively eaey to 
p rograa computers to  apply transform atlona to k e rn e ls,
B U T  vary  hard to take ap art the r e s u lt. A  complex " su r- 
fsce S tru c tu re "  may have numerous p o ssib le kernels-— does 
"Time E lla *  lik e  an arrow" have the same stru c tu re  aa 
"Susie slo g s lik e  a b ird 1 ' or " F ru it f ile s  Ilk a  sn orange?"
R e su lt: to program s computer to generate epaech— 
th at l a .  Invent aentences about a data stru c tu re  and type 
thaa o u t—  la  com paratively easy, but to have i t  recognize 
incoming se n ten c es, and break thea up in to  th e ir  kernel

D O  W E  M A H T  TALKIBG STSTEM S?
I had one q u ite  i r r ita tin g  experience with a 
''conversational"’ ayatem, th at la , computer prograa 
chat was supposed to  ta lk  back to  ae. I vae sup­
posed co type co 1c Id English aod I t vaa supposedly 
going to  type back co ae In Engllah. 1  found th e ex­
perience thoroughly I r r ita tin g . Ky aide o f che con­
versatio n , which I sin c ere ly  cried to keep simple, 
produced repeated apologies and confusion from the 
prograa. The guy who'd created che prograa kept ex­
plaining chat th e prograa would be improved, ao 
Chat evenCually I t  could handle responses lik e  v in e .
M y  reaction was, and la , W ho neede le t
Many people in  th e coaputer fie ld  seea C o think 
we want to  be able to  talk  to  coaputers and have thea 
calk back to  ua. Thia la  by no Beans a s e ttle d  B a tte r.
Talking prograaa are complicated and req u ire a 
lo t of apace In the machine, and (acre ia p o rtan tly ) 
require a lo t of tia e  by prograM ere who could achieve 
(I think) so re  In leaa ClM by other meana. Moreover, 
calking prograas produce an itT lcaclng s tr a te g ic a l 
paradox. In dealin g  vich huaan beloge, we knew vhec 
w e're dealing w ith, and can adjust what we eay accord­
ingly; there le  no wav co c e l l , except by a lo t of ex­
perim enting, what th e p rln clp lee  are in sid e a p a rtic u ­
la r talk in g  prograa; so th a t crying to  ad ju et co i t  
la  a scraln  and ao I r r ita tio n . (Coapare: ta lk in g  to  a 
stranger who aay or aay not Curn out Co be your now bo ss.) 
Now, soae prograaoers keep eeying th at ev entually th e y 'll 
have lc  actin g  Ju e t ae eaarc aa a re a l person, eo we n eedn't 
adjuet; but t h a t's  rid ic u lo u s. W e  alwave ad ju st to  re a l 
people. In oth er words, the huaan discomfort and i r r i t a ­
tio n  of pavchlna th e s v s tm  out can never be e lia ln a te d .
Furthermore, on today'e sequential equlpaent and 
with fea eib le  budgets. 1 personally think the likelihood 
of Baking prograas chat are r e a lly  general ta lk e rs ie  a 
foolish goal. There are many sla p le r waye of te llin g  
coaputer systems what you want to t e l l  thea— lig h t pen 
choice, fo r example.
Moreover, having to  type in  whole Engllah phrases 
can be i r r ita tin g . (W e c a n 't even gee inco the problea 
of having th e conputer pick apart Che audio l f  you calk 
i t  in .)
This i s  not to  eay understandably re e trlc te d  talking 
systeas sre  bad. I f  you know and understand the so rts of 
response the system makes C o what kinds of th in g , then an 
E nglleb-llke response is  r e a lly  s clear meeaage. For In­
atance, the JOSS system (the f ir s t Quickie language— 
see p. IS) had en eloquent message:
eh?
which a c tu a lly  a ea n t, What you have Ju st tgged In doee_jiot_ 
f i t  the ru lee  of acceptable Input for th is  sy ste a . But It 
was sh o rt, i t  was quick, I t  waa simple, and i t  wee almost 
p o lite.
S im ilarly , ta lk in g  ayateas that use an exact vocabu­
lary , whose llm ite  and a b iliti e s  are knwn to the person, 
are okay. (Wlnogred, eee Bibliography, hae a nice exaaple 
of te llin g  a computer to  stack blockS) where th e eyetem 
knows words lik e  between, on, sbove and ao on.) Where 
th is is  understood by che human, 1 C  can be a genuine con­
venience reth e r than a apurloue one.
(The probleB of rudeness in computer dialogue haa not 
been auch discussed. This le p artly  because aany prograa- 
aera are noc fu lly  aware of I t ,  o r, Indeed, some sre  so 
sk illed  in c ertain  su b tle  forms of rudeness they wouldn't 
even know chey w eren 't acceptable. The re s u lt i s  th a t cer­
tain  types of putdown, poke, peremptoriness and lmportunacy 
can find th e ir  way in to  coaputer dialogue a l l  too e asily .
O r,to put i t  another way: nobody lik e  to be talked back to. 
Cf. Those etupld green T R A N K  Y O U  light* on autom atic c o ll 
booths.)
Now, chle le  not to ssy that research in theee areas 
le wrong, or even th a t reeearchere' hopes of some break­
through ln talklng-eyatem s ia  mlegulded. I em saying, 
b a sica lly , th a t ta lk in g  systems cennot be teken fo r gran t­
ed ae the proper goel ln  computers to  be uaed by people; 
that the problema of rudeneee, and I r r ita tin g  the human 
u eer, are fa r g rea ter than many of these research ers sup­
pose; snd th a t th e re  may be a lte rn a tiv e s to  th le  p o c en tlal- 
ly e tern al leprechaun-chasing.
If lik e  the author you are beaueed by ehe great 
d if f ic u lty  of g e ttin g  along v ith  human beinge, then the 
c reation of extraneous beinge of Impenetrable ch aracter 
with vaguely human q u a lltle e  can only alarm you, and 
the prospect of theee ed d ltlo n al c ry p te -e n tltle s which 
n e t  be fended and p la ca te d , clawing a t ua f r m  th e ir 
niches a t every tu r n , le both d le ta e te fu l and a larain g .
A r t if ic i a l In te llig e n c e  en th u siasts u nfortunately 
ten! to  have a m agician's outlooki to  make c le a r how 
th e ir th in g s work would sp o il the ehow.
Thus, fo r a ra th e r p e cu liar a r t show held a t  New 
York's Jewish Hueeua in  1970, a group f r a  MIT b u ilt a 
large device th a t stacked blocke under c o n tro l of a 
m in le e ^ u te r (In te rd a ta  brand). Now, the f a c t th a t i t  
could stack and re*«tack blocks with j u s t a m lnieos^uter 
waa r e a lly  q u ite  an acctm^llshment. but th is  was not 
explained.
In ste ad , ehe block-etacking mechanism waa enclosed 
in  a larg e g la ss pen, in  which numerous g e rb ils --  hoppy 
l i t t l e  ro d en ts -- were free to  wander about. When a g e r- 
b il eaw th a t a block was about to  be stacked on him, he 
would se n sib ly  aove.
Now, i t  i s  f a ir ly  humorous , and no t c ru e l, to  pu t 
g e rb ils In to  a block-stacking machine. But th is  was 
offered to  the pu b lic as a device partaking of a f a r  more 
global a isa lo n , the experimental In tera ctio n  of liv in g  
c reatures and a dynamic self-im proving environment, 
blah blah b la h .
Passersby were awed. "W hy are those animals in  
there?” one would say, and the more informed one would 
usually say. ' I t ' s  s<ne kind of s c ie n tif ic  experim ent.*
Well, th is  i s  a tw ilig h t area, between science and 
whimsical hokua, b u t one cannot help w ishing simple and 
htaorous th in g s could be presented with th e ir  s ix p llc lty

sc ru tab le , b u t I had a cense th a t he wae worshiping i t .
He did no t move u n t i l  th e block sta rte d  coming down on top 
of him.
I take th is  as an alleg o ry .
S t tThe r e a l question la , can a aet^ of procedures 
play chess? Because Chat's what th e computer pro­
gram r e a lly  does, enact a se t of procedures.
And th e answer la  yes, f a ir ly  w ell.
Now, a cheBa prograa ie  not soaething you Joe 
down on ehe back of an envelope one afternoon. I t 's  
u sually an Imaense, convoluted th in g  Chat people have 
worked on fo r years. (Although I vaguely r e e a ll Chat 
second place ln  the 1970 Interco m p u ter cheee contest 
waa won by a prograa th a t occupied only 2000 locations 
ln  a 1 6 -b it minicomputer— ln oth er words, a compact 
and ericky sneaker.)
Now, simple games (lik e tlc - ta c - to e  and Nlm and 
even Cubic) can be worked eue e l l  Che wey: a l l  a lte r ­
n a tiv e s csn be examined by the program and the beet 
one found. Not eo w ith chess.
Chess b sslc a lly  involves, because of I ts  very 
many p o s s ib i liti e s , a "combinatorial explosion" of 
s lte r o a tlv e e  (see p. 4 f ) :  Chat i s ,  to  look s t  " a ll"  
the p o s s ib ilitie s  of a aidgaae would take forever ' 
(perhaps l i t e r a l l y — che Turing problem ), and thue

B asically  Chere ere two epproeches to  the design 
of chesa p rograas. In one epproach, the programmers 
look for s p e c ific  ch reets sod op p o rtu n ities In the 
d sta  stru c tu re  representing the bosrd, snd try  to  find 
good s tra te g ie s  fo r selectin g  good moves en the basis 
o f t h a .  T his is  the approach taken in  CORO, the 
"Cooper-Kos"chess program. The programmers se lec tiv e ly  
cope with ln d lvld u el problems and a trs te g le s  ss  they 
turn eu t to  be neceesary. (This meana th a t i t  la 
lik e ly  to  have sp e cific  A chlllee' h eele; which, of 
course, the authors of the progrea keep try in g  to  re­
p a ir by adding sp e cific  c o rrec tio n s.)
A  d if f e r e n t spprosch Is taken by the G reenblstt 
chess program. This 1s b asically  a big H eu ristic prog­
raa. I t  "lea rn s" b est stra te g ie s ln  chess by "watching" 
the game. That le , your pour h le to r le e l chess matches

Obviously th is i s  a field  lo I t s e l f ,  You won't get

chess and coap u ters, I t 's  the only thing to  be doing.

"Inform ation R e trie v al" 1 b one of thoae terms 
th a t laymen throw around as 1 f  I t  were a manhole 
cover. I t  eounda as though I t  means b o nuch, bo very*
»ich. And eo you a c tu a lly  hear people say thlnga lik e :
"But th a t would m ean... (pregnant pause) . . .  Informa­
tion R e tr ie v a l! ! ! "  S im ilarly , some of th e hokey new 
copyright n o tic e s you aee In books from W ith -It p u b lia h - 
era Intone th a t said books nay not be "placedIn any In ­
formation r e tr ie v a l s y s te m ..." I  take th i s  to mean 
th a t the p ubllehera a re  forbidding you to  put th e  book 
on a bookshelf, because "Information r e tr ie v a l"  sim ply 
means any way a t a l l  o f g ettin g  back Inform ation fro *  
anything. A  b o okshelf, alnce I t allows you to  read th e  
spinas of the books. I s  Indeed an Information R e trie v al 
System.
I t  happens, in c id e n ta lly , that the phrase "inform a­
tion r e tr ie v a l"  was coined In the f o r t ie s  by Calvin Hooers, 
inventor o f TB A C *“  Language (see pp. 18-21). ( I f  Wiener 
bad coined i t  be might have called  i t  Getback. I f  Dlebold 
had coined i t  i t  might have been Thnughtomatlon.)
Anyhow, numerous e n tire ly  d iffe re n t th in g s go on In 
the f ie ld , a l l  under the name of Information R e trie v a l.
Here are some.
1. Non-Computer r e tr ie v a l. (See Becker and Hayes, 
Automatic Inform ation R e trie v a l.)  These th in g s a re  kind 
of old-fashioned fun—  cards with holes punched a lo n g  the 
edge, f o r I n s ta n c e ,th a t you so rt with k n ittin g  n e ed le s, 
or the more recent systems with holes d r ille d  in  p la s tic  
cards. Trouble I s , of course, that computers ace becoming 
■ ic h  more convenient and even leas expensive than th e s e , 
counting your mm time as being worth something.
2. Document R e trie v a l. This b a sic a lly  is  an approach 
th a t g lo r if ie s  the old lib ra ry  card f i l e ,  except now th e  
a tu ff is  stored in computers rath e r than on c a rd s. But 
what’a sto re d  Is S t i l l  the name of the document, who WTOte 
i t ,  where I t was published and so on. Obviously h e lp fu l
to lib r a ria n s , but sc arce ly  exciting.
3- Automatic document indexing. Some o rg an isatio n s 
find i t  h elp fu l to  have a computer tr y  to  fig u re  out vhat 
a book 1b about, r a th e r  than have a person look a t  i t  and 
check. (I d o n 't aee why th is saves anything, b u t th e re  you 
a re .) Anyway, the te x t of the document (or se lec te d  p a rts ) 
a re poured through a computer program th a t s e le c ts , f o r  in -  
atance, keywords, th a t la , the moBt important words in  i t ,  
o r ra th e r words the program thinks STe most Im portant. Then 
th e se  keywords can go on tbe headings of lib r a ry  f i l e  cards, 
or whatever.
There are v arious related  systems by which people 
study, fo r in stan c e, the c ita tio n s between a r t i c l e s ,  but 
we wun’ t  get in to  th a t.
Content r e tr ie v a l. K o w  w e're g e ttin g  to  th e  sexy 
a tu ff. A systea for content re trie v a l Is one th a t somehow 
sto rea inform ation In a computer and le ts  you get I t  back
The tr ic k  on both counts Is of course how.
H all, as we said  on the other side of the book, any 
inform ation stored in  a conputer has a d ata s tr u c tu re , 
which simply means whatever arrangement of a lp h a b e tic a l 
c h arac ters, numbers and apeclal codes the computer happens 
to bs saving.
In a c o n te n t-re trle v a l system, Information on some 
subject is  somehow jamaed Into a data s tr u c tu re —  p o ssib ly  
even by human coders—  and then set up so people can g e t 
i t  back out again In aome way. Lot of p o s s ib i liti e s  h e re , 
get it?
In the w i t  s ta r tlin g  of these systems, the QAS, o r 
"Question-Answering System," some sort of dialogue program 
(see " A r tific ia l In te llig e n c e ,"  nearby) tr ie s  to  g iv e  you 
answers about the d ata stru c tu re . But th is  means th e re  
hava to  be a  whole lo t of programs:Then there I s  the m atter of consistency. The re a lly  
In te re stin g  su b je cts are the ones where d if f e r e n t authors 
claim opposing f a c ts  to  support opposite co n clu sio n s.
In other words, th e re  is inconsistency w ithin th e  content 
of the f ie ld . In  th i s  case such systems are going to  have 
a problem. (See "Raaho-Hon P rin c ip le ” under "T issue of 
Thought," f f ~ y \  '*"1.7^
Another fundamental point 1b th is . I t  may be easy 
enough to program a system to answer the q u e stio n ,
V H A T  TIM E D O E S  T H E  N E X T  P L A N E  LEA V E FO R  L A G U A H D IA ?
but I t  i s  a lo t sim p ler to A dlsplay schedules your eye can 
run down, or allow  you to  go look a t some kind of graphic 
d isplay.
Speaking p e rso n a lly , I do n 't Ilk a  ta lk in g  to  machines 
and I d o n 't lik e  th e ir  talking back to  me. I'm  n o t saying 
you have to ag re e. I'm ju a t te llin g  you y o u 're allow ed to 
fee l th a t way.
5. Screen sumnarlee ■  These systems le t  you s i t  s t 
a coaputer disp lay  screen and read summaries of vario u s 
th in g s, as w ell as run through then w ith v a rio u s programs 
to look for keywords. (The M ew York Times now o f f e r s  such 
a system, co stin g  over a thousand d o lla rs a month to  sub­
s c rib e r s .)
6. "F u ll- te x t systems. 1 1  These a re  system s th a t 
one way or another allow  you to read a ll the te a t  of 
something from a computer display screen . There a re  
those of us who aee theae as the wave o f the f u tu r e , X

This has been b r ie f  and has skipped a l o t .  Anyway, 
as you see, IR I s  no one thing.

we all go through changes, after all— but after consideration have decided to re-run

Did you find school dismal and dreary?  
Did it turn you off?  
Here the author proposes safe and legal  
ways to turn kids on.by Theodor H. Nelson
The Nelson Organization 
New York
Some think the educational system is basically 
all right, and more resources would get it working 
again. Schools would do things the same way. ex­
cept more so, and things would get better.
In that case the obvious question would be, how 
‘ can computers help? How can computers usefully 
supplement and extend the traditional and accept­
ed forms of teaching? This is the question to which 
present-day efforts in "computer-assisted instruc­
tion” —  called CAI —  seem to respond.
But such an approach is of no possible interest 
to the new generation of critics of our school sys­
tem —  people like John Holt (  Why Children Fail),  
Jonathan Kozol (Death at an Early Age)  and 
James Herndon (The Way It Spozed To Be).  More
and more, such people are severely questioning the 
general framework and structure of the way we 
teach.
These writers describe particularly ghastly 
examples of our schooling conditions. But such 
horror stories aside, we are coming to recognize 
that schools as we know them appear designed at 
every level to sabotage the supposed goals of edu­
cation. A child arrives at school bright and early 
in his life. By drabness we deprive him of interests. 
By fixed curriculum and sequence we rob him of 
his orientation, initiative and motivation, and by 
testing and scoring we subvert his natural intelli­
gence.
Schools as we know them all run on the same 
principles: iron all subjects flat and then proceed, 
in groups, at a forced march across the flattened 
plain. Material is dumped on the students and their 
responses calibrated; their interaction and involve­
ment with the material is not encouraged nor taken 
into consideration, but their dutifulness of response 
is carefully monitored.
While an exact arrangement of intended motiva­
tions for the student is preset within the system, 
they do not usually take effect according to the 
ideal. It is not that students are //^motivated, but 
motivated askew.  Rather than seek to achieve in 
the way they are supposed to. students turn to 
churlishness, surliness, or intellectual sheepishness. 
A general human motivation is god-given at the 
beginning and warped or destroyed by the edu­
cational process as we know it: thus we internalize 
at last that most fundamental of grownup goals: 
just to get through another day.
Because of this procedure our very notion ot 
human ability has suffered. Adult mentality is
£ ni)* ib

An interesting point, incidentally, is that people read  this a lot of different ways.
One Dean of Education hilariously m isread it as an across-the-board plug for CAI. 
Others read in it various forms of menace or advocacy of generalized mechanization. 
One letter-w riter said I was a menace but at least w riting articles kept me off the 
streets. Here is my fundamental point: com puter-assisted instruction , applied thought­
lessly and im itatively, threatens to extend the w orst features of education as it "IF now .
cauterized, and we call it “normal.’ ' Most people's 
minds are mostly turned off most of the time. We 
know virtually nothing of human abilities except 
as they have been pickled and boxed in schools; we 
need to ignore all that and start fresh. To want stu­
dents to be “normal” is criminal, when we are all 
so far below our potential. Buckminster Fuller, in 
/ Seem To Be A Verb,  says we are all born ge­
niuses; Sylvia Ashton-Warner tells us in Teacher  
of her success with this premise, and of the bril­
liance and creative potential she was able to find in 
all her schoolchildren.
Curricula themselves destructively arrange the 
study situation. By walls between artificially segre­
gated "studies” and "separate topics” we forbid the 
pursuit of interest and kill motivation.
In ordinary schooling, the victim cannot orient 
himself to the current topic except by understand-
t o o k *
ing the official angle of approach and presenta­
tion. Though tie-ins to previous interests and 
knowledge are usually the best way to get an initial 
sense of a thing, there is only time to consider the 
officially presented tie-ins. (Neither is there time 
to answer questions, except briefly and rarely well 
—  and usually in a way that promotes “order” by 
discouraging “extraneous” tie-ins from coming up.)
The unnecessary division and walling ot sub­
jects. sequencing and kibbling of material lead peo­
ple to expect simplifications, to feel that naming a 
thing is understanding it, to fear complex wholes; 
to believe creativity means recombination, the 
parsing of old relations, rather than synthesis.
Like political boundaries, curriculum boundar­
ies arise from noticeable features of a continuum 
and become progressively more fortified. As be­
hind political borders, social unification occurs 
within them, so that wholly dissimilar practitioners 
who share a name come to think they do the same 
thing. And because they talk mainly to each other, 
they forget how near is the other side of the border.
Because of the fiction of "subjects,” great con­
cern and consideration has always gone into cal­
culating the “correct” teaching sequence for each 
“subject.” In recent years radical new teaching se­
quences have been introduced for teaching various 
subjects, including mathematics and physics. But 
such efforts appear to have been misinformed by 
the idea of supplanting the “wrong” teaching se­
quence with the "right” teaching sequence, one 
which is "validated.” Similarly, we have gone from 
a time when the instructional sequence was a bal­
ance between tradition and the lowest common de­
nominator of each subject, to a time when teachers 
may pick "flexible optimized strategies” from text-If the computer is a universal control system,  
let’s give kids universes to control.<3

Education oughi to be dear, inviting nnd enjoyable, 
without booby-traps, humiliations, condescension or 
boredom. It ought to teach and reward initiative, curi­
osity, ihe habit of self-motivation. intellectual involve­
ment. Studcnls should develop, through practice, abili­
ties to think, argue and disagree intelligently.
Educators and computer enthusiasts tend to agree on 
these goals. Bul what happens? Many of ihc inhuman­
ities of the existing system, no less wrong for being 
unitentional, arc being continued into coniputcr-assist- 
cd leaching.
Although the promoters of computer-assisted instruc­
tion, affectionately called “CAI," seem to think of them­
selves as being at the vanguard of progress in all di­
rections, the field already seems to operate according 
:o a stereotype. We may call this “classic” or "conven- 
ional” C A I, a way of thinking depressLngly summarized 
n “The Use o f Computers in Education"  by Patrick 
iuppes, Scientific American, September, 1966, 206- 
220, an article of semi-classic stature.
It is an uncxamined premise of this article that the 
computer system will always decide what the student 
is to study and control his movements through il. The 
student is to be led by the nose through every subject, 
and the author expresses perplexity over the question 
of how the system can decide, at all limes, where  to 
lead the student by the nose (top of col. 3, p. 219). 
But let us nol anticipate alternatives.
It is often asserted (as by Alpert and Bitzer in "A d­
vances in Computer-Based Education,"  Science, 
March 20, 1970) that this is not the only approach 
current. The trouble is that it seems  to be the only ap­
proach current, and in the expanding computer uni­
verse everyone seems to know whal c a i “is.” And this 
is it.
Computer-assisted instruction, in this classical sense, 
is the presentation by computer of bite-sized segments 
of instructional material, branching among them ac­
cording to involuntary choices by ihe student ("an- 
swere") and embedding material presented the student 
in some sort of pseudo-conversation (“Very good. 
Now, Johnny, point at the . . .")
CAI; Based on nnnccessuy premises
At whichever level of complexity, all these conven­
tional c a i systems arc based on three premises: lhat 
all presentations consists of items,  short chunks and 
questions; lhat the items are arranged into sequences,  
though these sequences may branch and vary under 
control of the computer; and finally, that these sequen­
ces are to be embedded in a framework of dialogue;  
with the computer composing sentences and questions 
appropriately based on the student's input and the 
branching structure of the materials. Let us call such 
systems sic (Sequenced-Item Conversational) systems.
These three premises are united. For Ihere to be 
dialogue means Ihere musl be an underlying graph 
structure of potential sequences around which dialogue 
may be generated; for there to be potential sequences 
means breakpoints, and hence items.
Let us question each of the premises in turn.
1. Is dialog®* pleasant or desirable? Compulsory 
interaction, whether with a talking machine or a stereo­
typed human, is itself a put-down or condescension. 
(Note lhat on superhighways there is often a line of 
cars behind the automatic loll booths, even when the 
manned ones art open.) Moreover, faked interaction 
can be an annoyance. (Consider the green light at the 
automatic toll booth thal lights up with a “thank you.") 
Moreover, dialogue by simple systems tends to have a 
fake quality. It is by no means obvious that phony 
dialogue with a machine will please the student.
2. Is (be Hem approach necessary? If (he student 
were in control, he could move around in areas of 
material, leaving each scene when he got what he want­
ed, or found il unhelpful.
3- A n  sequences necessary? Prearranged sequences 
become unnecessary if the student can see whal he has 
yet to learn, then pursue il.
T^€- sense ot prestige and participation
CAI: ttnncccssiii> coin plication
The general belief among practitioners is that ma­
terials .for computer-based teaching are extremely dif­
ficult to create, or "program." Because of possible 
item weakness and the great variety of possible se­
quences within the web, extensive experimentation and 
debugging are required. Each item must be carefully 
proven; and the different sequences open to a student 
must all be tested for iheir effectiveness. All possible 
misunderstandings by a student need lo be anticipated 
and prevented in this web of sequences, which must be 
designed for its coverage, correct order, and general 
effectiveness.
CAI: general wrongfrinoss
Computers offer us the first real chance to let the 
human mind grow to its full potential, as il cannot 
within ihe stifling and insulting setting of existing 
school systems. Yet most of the systems for computer- 
assisted instruction seem to me to be perpetuating and 
endorsing much that is wrong, even evil, in our present 
educational system, c ai in ils conventional fonn en­
larges and extends the faults of the American educa­
tional system itself. They are:♦  Conducivtness to boredom;
• The removal of opportunities for initiative;
* Gratuitous concerns, both social and administra­
tive ( subject,” “progress” in subject);
• Grades, which really reflect commitment level, 
anxiety, and willingness to focus on core emphasis;
• Stereotyped and condescending treatment of the 
student (ihe “Now-Johnny” box in ihe computer re­
placing the one thal sits before the class);
* 4 ^ ie narrowing of curricula and available materials 
for results" at the expense of motivation and general­
ized orientation;
• Destructive testing of a kind we would nol permit 
on delicate machinery; and,
* oven or hidden emphasis on invidious ratings. 
(Ungraded schools are nice-—but how many units did 
you complete today?).
There are of course improvements, for instance in 
the effects of testing. In the tell-test, tell-test nattering 
or CAI, ihe testing becomes merely an irritant, bul one 
certainly not likely lo fosier enthusiasm.
WBul isn't CAI ‘scknlific?’
Part of Cai's mystique is based upon the idea that 
leaching can bccomc "scicntific” in the light of modern 
research, especially learning theory, ll is understand­
able lhat researchers should promote this view and 
lhat oihcrs should fall for il.
Laymen do not understand, nor arc ihcy told. thal 
'learning theory" is an extremely technical, mathemat­
ically oriented, description of the behavior of abstract 
and idealized organisms learning non-unificd things 
under specific condiiions of motivation and non-dis­
traction.
Let us assume, politely, lhal learning theory is a 
full and consisieni body of knowledge. Bccausc of its 
name, learning theory has al least whal wc may call 
nominal relevancc to teaching: bul real rclcvance is 
another matter, ll may he relevant as Newtonian equa­
tions are to shooting a good game of pool: implicit but 
without practical bearing.
Bccausc of the actual character of learning theory, 
and ils general remoteness from non-sicrilc conditions, 
actual relevance to any pariicular type of applicuiion 
must still be demonstrated. To postulate lhat the theory 
still applies in diluted or shifted circumstances is a 
leap of faith. Human beings arc not. taken all together, 
very like ihc idealized pigeons or rats of learning 
theory, and their motivations and other circumstanccs 
arc not easily controlled. Studies conccrncd with rate 
of repetition and reinforcement are scarcely relevant 
if Ihc student hates or docs nol understand whal he is 
doing.
I  do nol mean li>  iiUaek all <ai. or an> leaching 
system which is cHcclive ami gialifying. What I  doubt 
is that sic sysiems for cai will become more and more 
wonderful as effort progresses, or lhat Ihe goal of talk­
ing tutorial systems is reachable and appropriate. And 
what I further suspect is lhat we are building boredom 
systems that nol mil* make hie duller bul sap inicllcc- 
lual interest in the same old way.
Should systems ‘instructT
Drill-and-praciicc systems arc definitely a good thing 
lor the acquisition of skills and response sets, an im­
provement over workbtxiks and the like, furnishing 
both corrections and adjustment. Ihey are boring, bul 
probably levs so than (he usual materials. I tut the cai 
enthusiasts seem lo believe ihc same co n w aiM B h m l 
chunk techniques can he extcntcd to the realm of ideas, 
to systems that will tutor and chide, and that this will 
provide the same sort of natural interest provided by 
a live tutor’s instruction.
The conventional poini of view in cai claims thal 
because validation is so important, ii is necessary lo 
have a standardized formal of item, sequence and dia- 
loguc. This jusiifies lurning Ihe endeavor into pkl>- 
work within ilcms and sequence complexes, with 
attendant curifcular frcc/c. and Modem inanition and 
boredom. This is entirely premature. Ihc variety ot 
alternative systems for compuier leaching have ihM 
even begun to be explored. Should s te rn s  ■•instruct
at all?

A modest proposal
The alternative is straightforward. Instead of devis­
ing elaborate systems permitting tbe computer or its 
instructional contents to control the situation, why 
not permit the student to control the system, show him 
how to do so intelligently, and make jt easy for him 
to find his own way? Discard ihe sequences, items 
and conversation, and allow the student to move freely 
through materials which he may control. Never mind 
optimizing reinforcement or validating teaching se­
quences. Motivate the user and let him loose in a 
wonderful place.
Let the student control the sequence, pul him in 
control of interesting and dear material, and make him 
feel good—comfortable, interested, and autonomous. 
Teach him to orient himself: not having the system 
answer questions, all typed in, bul allowing the student 
to get answers by looking in a fairly obvious place. 
(Dialogue is unnecessary even when it does not in­
trude.) Such ultra-rich environments allow the student 
to choose what he will study, when he will sludy it and 
how he will study it, and to what criteria of accomplish­
ment he will aim. Let the student pick what he wishes 
to study next, decide when he wishes io be tested, and 
give him a variety of interesting materials, events and 
opporiunilies. Let the student ask to be tested on what 
he thinks he knows, when he is ready, selecting the 
mosi appropriate form of lesiing available.
This approach has several advantages. First, il cir­
cumvents the incredible obstacles created by the 
dialoguc-item-scquencc philosophy. It ends the danger
io students of bugs in the material. And last, it does 
what education is supposed to do— foster student en­
thusiasm, involvement, and self-reliance.
Under such circumstances students will actually be 
interested, motivated to achieve far more than they 
have ever achieved within the normal instructional 
framework; and any lopsidedness which may result 
will be far offset by the degree of accomplishment 
which will occur— it being much better to create lop­
sided but enthusiastic genius specialists than listless, 
apathetic, or cruelly rebellious mediocrities. If they 
start soon enough they may even reach adulthood with 
natural minds: driven by enthusiasm and interest, 
crippled in no areas, eager to learn more, and far 
smarter lhan people ordinarily end up being.
Enthusiasm and involvement are what really count. 
This is why the right to explore far outweighs any 
administrative advantages of creating and enforcing 
“subjects" and curriculum sequences. The enhancement 
or motivation that will rollow from letiing kids learn 
anything they want to learn will far outweigh any 
specialization lhat may result. By ihe elimination or 
benign replacement of both curriculum and tests in an 
ultra-rich environment, we will prevent the attrition of 
Ihe natural motivation of children from its initially 
enormous levels, and mental development will be the 
natural straight diagonal rather than the customary 
parabola.
Is It so hanf? s o w  Idea
c ai is said to be terribly hard. It would seem all the 
harder, then, to give students the richer and more 
stimulating environments advocated here. This is be­
cause of the cramped horizons of computer teaching 
today. Modest goals have given us modest visions, far 
helow what is now possible and will soon be cheap.

oompotB witb disk aod tape.Some premises relevant to teaching
1. The human mind is born free, yei everywhere 
il is in chains. The educational system serves 
mainly to destroy for most people, in varying 
degrees, intelligence. curiosity, enthusiasm, and 
intellectual initiative and self-confidence. We 
are born with these. I hey arc gone or severely 
diminished when wc leave school.
2. Everything is interesting, until ruined for us. 
Nothing in the universe is intrinsically unin­
teresting. Schooling systematically ruins ihings 
for us, wiping out these interests; the last ihiog 
to be ruined determines your profession.
3. There are no “subjects.” The division of the 
universe into “subjects" for teaching is a mat­
ter of tradition and administrative convenience.
4. There is no natural or necessary order of 
learning. Teaching sequences are arbitrary, 
explanatory hierarchies philosophically spuri­
ous. "Prerequisites" arc a fiction spawned by 
the division of the world into “subjects:" and 
maintained by not providing summaries, intro­
ductions or orientational materials exccpt to 
those arriving through a certain door.
5. Anyone retaining his natural mental facilities 
can learn anything practically on his own, 
given encouragement and resources.
6. Most (caches mean well, but ihey arc so 
conccrncd wilh promoting their images, atti­
tudes nnd style of order that very little else 
can be communicalcd in ihe time remaining, 
and almost none of it attractively.
books.' And this all ignores a simple fact: all arc 
arbitrary. Instructional sequences aren't needed at all 
if the people are motivated and Ihe materials are clear 
and available.
Testing as we know it (integrated with walled curric­
ula ancf instructional sequences) is a destructive activ­
ity, particularly for the orientation which it creates. 
The concerns of testing are extraneous: learning to 
figure out low-level twists in questions that lead no­
where, under pressure.
The system of tensions and defenses il creates in the 
student's personality are unrelated to the subjcci or 
the way people might rclalc lo the subject. An exploit­
ive altitude is foslered. Nol becoming involved with 
the subject, the student grabs for roie payoff raihcr 
than insight.
All in a condescending circumstance. Condescension 
is built into the system at all levels, so pervasive it is 
scarcely noticed. Students are subjccicd io a grim 
variety of put-downs and denigrations. While many 
people evidently believe Ihis to be right, ils productivity 
in building confident and sclf-respccting minds may be 
doubted.
The problems of Ihc school are not parlicularly the 
teachcr’ s fault. The practice of (caching is principally 
involved wilh managing the class, keeping up face, and 
projecting the image of ihe subject thal conforms to the 
teacher’ s own prcdilcclions. The educational system is 
thereby committed to the fussy and prissy, lo the en­
force men t of peculiar standards of righteousness and 
the elevation of leachcrs— a huge irrelevant shell 
around ihc small kernel of knowledge transmitted.
TJie usual attacks on computer leaching tend to be 
sentimental and emotional picas for the alleged hu­
manism ot Ihe existing system. Those who are opposed 
to (he use of compuiers lo icach generally believe the 
computer to be “cold” and "inhuman." The leachcr 
is considered ''warm" and “human." 'I his view is ques­
tionable on both sides.
The computer is as inhuman as wc make it. The 
computer is no more “cold" and “inhuman" than a 
toaster, bathtub or automobile (all associated with 
warm human activities). Living tcachcrs can be as in­
human as members of any people-prodding profession, 
sometimes more so. Computcrists speak of “Irccing 
teachers for the creative part of their work;" in many 
cases it is not clear what creative tasks they could be 
freed for.
At the last, it is to rescue  ihc student from the in­
human leachcr, and allow him to relate directly and 
personally to the intrinsically interesting subject mai­
ler, that wc need io use computers in education.
Many successful systems of icachcrlcss learning exist 
in our socicly: professional and industrial magazines: 
conventions and their display booths and brochures; 
technical sales pitches (most remarkably, those of med­
ical "detail men”): hobbyist circles, which combine 
personal acquaintance with a round of magazines and 
gatherings; think-tanks and research institutes, where, 
specialists trade fields; and the rcspcctful briefing.
None of these is like (he conventional classroom 
with its haughty rcsource-chairman; they arc not run 
on condescension: and they get a lot across. Wc tend 
to think they arc nol “educaiion” and thal the methods 
cannot be Iransfcrrcd or extended to the regions now 
ruled by conventional leaching. Oul why nol?
If everything wc ate were kibbled into uniform dng- 
food, and the amount consumed a( each feeding time 
tediously watched and tested, we would have little 
fondness for eating, But ihis is what the schools do to 
our food for thought, and this is whal happens to 
people’s minds in primary school, secondary school 
and most colleges.
This is the way to produce a nation of sheep or 
clerks. If wc are serious about wanting people to have 
creative and energetic minds, il is nol whal we ought
io do. Energy and enthusiasm are natural to ihc hunun 
spirit; why drown Ihem?

Discrete hyperlexis
“ Hypertext" m eans forms of writing which branch 
or perform on request; they are best presented on com ­
puter display screens.
In ordinary w riting the author may break sequence 
for footnotes o r insets, but the use of print on p? pr 
makes some basic sequence essential. T he compuv 
display screen, how ever, permits footnotes on footnotes 
on footnotes, and pathw ays of any structure the author 
wants to create.
Discrete, o r chunk style, hypertexts consist of sepa­
rate pieces of text connected by links.
Ordinary prose appears on the screen' and m ay be 
moved forw ard and back by throttle. An asterisk or 
other key in the lext m eans, not an ordinary footnote, 
but a jump — to an entirely new presentation on the 
screen. Such jum pable interconnections become part 
of the writing, entering into the prose medium itself as 
a new way to provide explanations and details to the 
seeker. T hese links m ay be artfully arranged according 
to meanings o r relations in the subject, and possible 
tangents in the reader’s mind.There arc a screen and two throttles. The first 
throttle moves the lext forward and backw ard, up and 
down on the scrccn. T he second ihrotilc causcs changes 
in the writing itself: throttling toward you cause* the 
text lo becom c lout ; , r by minute degrees. G aps appear 
between phrases; nu.v words and phrases pop into the 
gaps, an item at a time. Push hack on the throttle and 
the writing becomes shorter and less detailed.
T he stretchtext is stored as a text stream  wilh extras, 
coded to pop in and pop oul at the desired altitudes:

Performing hvpergram s
A hypergram is a performing or branching picture: 
for instance, this angle, with the bar-graph of its re­
lated trigonom etric functions. The student may turn 
the angle upon the screen, seizing it with the light-pen, 
and watch the related trigonometric functions, dis­
played as bar charts, change correspondingly.
Hypergrams may also be programmed to show the 
consequences of a user’s prod— what follows or ac­
companies som e m otion of the picture that he m akes 
with a pointing tool, like the heartbeat sequence.
Slrclchlext^ills in lhe details
This form of hypertext is easy lo use without gelling 
lost. As a form  o f wriiing. it has special advantages for 
discursive and loosely structured materials— for in­
stance historical narratives.Stretchtext, a kind of hypertext, 
is basically a form of writing closely 
related to other prose. It is read by 
a user or student from a computer 
display screen. The user, or student, 
controls it, and causes it to change, 
with throttles connected to the 
computer. Stretchtext gets longer, 
by adding words and phrases, or 
shorter, by subtracting words and 
phrases, on demand.
H yperm ap zips up or down
T he screen is a map. A steering device permits the 
user lo move the m ap around the world’s surface: a 
throttle zoom s it in. Not by discrete jum ps, but ani­
mated in small changes, the m ap grows and grows in 
scale. M ore details appear as the magnification in­
creases. The user may request additional display modes 
or “overlays,” such as population, climate, and indus­
try. Such additional features m ay pop into view on 
request
Queriable illuslralions: a form of hypergram
A “ hypergram ” is a picture thal can branch or per­
form on request. In this particular exam ple, we see 
on the screen a line-drawing wilh protruding labels. 
W hen the student points at a label, it becom es a sliding 
descriptive ribbon, explaining the thing labelled.
O r asterisks in an illustration may signal jumps to 
detailed diagrams and explanations, as in discrete 
hypertexts.T h e student of anatomy m ay use his light-pen as a 
scalpel for a deceased creature on the screen. As he 
cuts, the tissue parts. He could also turn the light-pen 
into hemostat or forceps, and fully dissect the creature 
— o r put it back together again. (This need not be a 
com plex simulation. Many key relationships can be 
shown by means of fairly simple schematic pictures, 
needing a data structure not prohibitively complicaicd.)
Ilypcr-comics sire fun
Hyper-comics are perhaps the simplest and most 
straightforward hyper-medium, lhe screen holds a 
com ic strip, bul one which branches on the student's 
request. For instance, dilferent characters could be used 
lo explain things in different ways, with the student able 
lo choose which type of explanation he wanted ;ii a 
specific lime.
‘Technicality’  is not necessary
Proponents of c a i wanl us to believe that scientific 
teaching requires a ccrtain setup and format, incom­
prehensible to the layman and lo be left to experts. 
This is simply not true. “Technicality" is a myth. The 
problem  is not one of technical rightness, bul what

Sobs coaputer displays have to be deoply 
attached to a conputer and soae don't. Those 
latter we call display terminals.
A display terninal is like an ordinary 
coaputer terainal (see p ): that is, funda- 
aentally a device by which a computer and a 
person can type at each other.  However, dis­
play terainal 3 have screens.
Now, soae display terminals only show 
te*t, just like ordinary printing terainals 
(described on the other side). But manufac­
turers are free to add any other features, and 
so different manufacturers aake it possible to 
do various kinds of pictuTe-aaking with their 
particular display terainals, if appropriate 
prograas are running in the coaputer that con­
trols thea.
Soae dpvices are sold as display terainals 
but actually, to further confuse the issue, 
contain coaplete minicomputers. (The fact 
that the aanufacturer may not stress this is 
simply a marketing angle he has chosen.) Siai- 
larly, certain terainals contain microprocessors 
(see p. V*J), which means they can be prograamed 
to behave like various other terminals, but ordi­
narily they cannot be prograamed to do much else 
by themselves.
Without getting into it deeplv, there are two main 
types of display terainal: those that are refreshed and 
those that are not. A refreshed display Is one whose 
viewing surface fades and must be continually re-£illed; 
a non-refreshed display somehow stores the presentation 
in the viewing surface itself.

Refreshed displays have to have some other kind of 
of symbolic (digital) memory, whose contents repeated­
ly go to the screen:W l  V  H o e i ;
The computer diaplay screen la the new 
frontier of our lives.
That auch eyutems should (snd will) be 
fun goes without saying. Thai they will also 
be a place to work may be less obvious from 
lhe lone of this publication, so I want to stress 
It here.
The Ihing about diaplay screens—  especial' 
ly the high-performance, sub routining Kind­
is lhal the screen can become a place from 
which lo control events In the outside world,
Example: I  believe a town In N.Y. State 
has Its electrical system hooked up to an H JIIOM  
subroutlning display (made by Information Dis­
plays, Inc.. snd coupled to a Vsrlan 820 mini­
computer). Instead of having a wail with s big 
painted map having swltchee set Into it, like 
many such control centers, the switches are 
linked directly lo the minicomputer, and a pro­
gram in the minicomputer connects these circuits 
to the pictures on the screen. Thus to throw 
a switch In the real w orld, the operator points 
with Ms lightpen al the picture of the switch,
and the minicomputer throws the awltch,
There are oil reflnerlea lhat work the 
same way, The operator can control flows 
among pipes and tanks by pointing al their 
pictures, or at symbols connected with them, 
and bingo, it happens Out There.
In another case, a person designing some­
thing at a screen can look across the room and 
see a machine producing what he Just finished 
designing a few minutes ago. I wish 1  could 
say more sbout lhat particular setup.
The true problem lhat 1  think Is emerging, 
though. Is Lhe problem of system response and 
style. Okay, so you're controlling widget 
sasembly, or traffic light g rid s, at Lhe CRT 
screen. The real queatlon la, how does lhe 
screen behave and respond? Thia la not, dam
it, a technical issue. It's psychological and 
then aome. The design of acreen activities 
which will enjoyebly focus the uaer's mind on 
his proper concerns-- no matter how peraonal 
these may be— Is the new frontier of design, 
of art. and of architecture. Bul more of that 
later.
Now, the Xerox Corporation haa said lhal 
they Intend to replace paper (or, tha way I 
heard it, "Somebody ia going to replace paper 
with screens, and It will be either IBM  o r ua, 
so let's have It be us,"^
Well and good. Save the trees and stem 
lhe grey menace. But the question la: what 
will lhe system* be like? How should Ihey per­
form? What forma will information take? What 
conventions, structures, diagrama. animations, 
ways to sign things, waya to view things ...
H O W  SHALL IT BE?
I  am afraid that aa long as people are be­
fuddled with technicalities, or confused by those 
Who profess that theae considerations are ihelr 
a pec laity by right, we will never get straight.  
lacking dme for the full discussion, I  give you 
a motto;
IF THE BUTTON IS NOT SHAPED LIKE THE THOUGHT , 
THE THOUGHT WILL END UP SHAPED LIKE THE BUTTON.
SAVING ENERGY WITH COMPUTER DISPLAY
A timely criticism of computer display is 
that it needs electricity. But (as mentioned 
elsewhere) it saves paper, and, importantly, it 
bodes to save energy as well.
IF WE SWITCH TO COMPUTER SCREENS FROM 
PAPER, PEOPLE WON’T HAVE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH. 
Instead of commuting to offices in the center 
of town, people can set up their offices in 
the suburbs, and share the documentary struc­
ture of the work situation through the screens.
This view has been propounded, indeed, by 
Peter Goldmark, former director of research for 
CBS Labs, the man who brought you the LP record.Non-refreshed displays simply take the symbols 
from the computer, blaa them onto the screen, and that's 
it until the screen is erased (by either the computer or 
the user).

If you have not seen interactive coaputer 
display, you have not lived.
Except for a few people who can laagine it-- 
and I'a trying to help you with that as hard as I 
can-- aost people just don't aet it till they see 
it. They can't imagine what it's like to manipu­
late a picture. To have a diagram respond to you.
To change one part of a picture, and watcIT TKe rest 
adapt.  These are some of the things that can hap­
pen in interactive coaputer display-- all depending, 
of course, on the prograa.
For soae reason there are a lot of people who 
pooh-pooh coaputer display: they say it's "not 
necessary," or "not worth it,” or that "you can get 
just as good results other ways."
Personally, I wouldn’t thing of trying to 
Justify coaputer display on "practical" grounds.
So what if it offers you faster access to infor- 
aation and pictures and aaps anldiagraas, the 
ability to siaulate extreaely complex things by 
modifying pictures, the ability to go through 
complex transactions with the system in very 
little time, the ability to create things in the 
world almost instantaneously (say, by creating 
fabric patterns which are then automatically 
woven, or design 3D objects which are then auto­
matically milled by machines), and never mind 
that It enables the user, say, to control entire
oil refineries by the flick of a lightpen.
As far as I'm concerned, the»« matters 
aren't very important coapared to changing the 
world: aaklng education an exciteaent, rather 
than a prison; giving scholars total access to 
writings and notes, in new complex fora; allowing 
people to play laaginatlvely, and raising human 
minds to tne potentials they should have reached 
long ago; end helping people think at the deepest 
level about very heavy and complex alternatives - - 
which confront us more ominously today than ever.Most refreshed displays use an actual television 
screen-- that is, a CRT (see p.ft*t-7) whose entire area 
is repeatedly re-painted by the elctron beam.
Since computers send text out to terminals as in­
dividual alphabetic and punctuation codes, each terainal 
must contain circuitry to change the character code to a 
visible alphabetical character on the screen. Such a 
piece of circuitry is called a character generator.  There 
are various kinds, they go at various speeds,  some offer 
more different characters than others.
Display terminals generally have a little marker, or 
cursor, that the user or the computer can move around the 
screen. The computer can sense what the user is pointing 
at by the motion codes it gets, telling where the user has 
moved the cursor.
I had intended here to print a little directory of 
display terminal manufacturers, but there simply is not 
time. See section on terminals, other side.
Note that the term video terminal is often used, in­
correctly, for any display terminal. The term "video" 
should only be used when the screen is refreshed by an 
actual video raster. (See ’ ’Lightning in a Bottle," p.***-}.)
Text terminals (also called alphabetic terminals, 
character terminals or keyscopes) simply show written text, 
put in either by the computer or the user. (Soae terminals, 
called transaction terainals, can be divided up into specific 
areas that the user may and may not type into-- for banking 
and stuff. However, whether that form of terminal is 
necessary may also be a matter of taste in the progTan 
design.)
Text terminals range in price from, say, $1500 on up 
to $6 500. (This last is the price of a remarkable color 
text terminal demonstrated by Tec, Inc., at the 19 74 National 
Coaputer Conference. Each alphabetic position could con­
tain a letter and/or a bright color; altogether the screen 
could hold big colorful pictures made up of these bright 
spaces. Ostensibly just a text terminal, actually the de­
vice could be regarded as an Instant Movie Generator for 
television animation. But it may take Tec, Inc. awhile to 
realize what they have created.)
Graphic terainals offer some kind of pictures on their 
screens.  TKese cone in a great variety: line-drawing, some 
without, some with levels of grey. Of interest to the be­
ginner are:
"The Tektronix." (Also called "the greenie," or 
"the green screen.") Tektronix, Inc., makes a 
display based on a pale green storage tube they 
aake. (So does Computer Displays, Inc.) Such 
displays allow you to put more and more text and 
pictures on a screen, crowding it all up-- but 
you can't take the lines or words off individually.

YOUR BASIC TYPES OF COMPUTER DISPLAY
(Note: the term "display" is also used 
in this field to refer to numbers and letters 
that can be made to light up in fixed positions, 
like on your pocket calculators. Those will 
not be discussed here. If you're interested 
see an article on the subject by Alan Sobel,
Scientific American, early 1973 sometime.)
THE FORKED LIGHTNING
" Because their words have
forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night."
—  Dylan Thomas
The most basic, and yet eventually the 
most versatile, computer display ie that of the 
CRT, or bottled lightning (as 1  like to call it).
It is, you know: a beam of electrons, just like 
lightning in a storm, but from the neck of a 
very empty bottle to its flat bottom, whose 
chemically coated surface we watch. As manip­
ulated by the computer, the CRT stabs its beam 
to all corners of the faceplate: forked lightning.
Computer display began in the late forties.
Computers themselves were completely new ,  
and so was Mr. Dumont's magical Cathode Ray 
Tube or CRT (see p.**&), developed on a 
crash basis during the war so we could have 
radar, and as long as it was around after the 
war, we gol television.
But the lightning bottle, or CRT, can be 
used in a variety of ways. Its control plates, 
which move the ray of electrons around on the 
screen, can be given various different elec­
tronic signals, causing the beam to move around 
in different patterns. In normal video, the 
signals move the beam in a zigzag pattern, 
where the zigs are very close together and the 
zags are invisible; the carpel of zigs covers 
the screen over and over in a repetitive pattern, 
and the beam's changing intensity paints the 
picture.
But we can drive the CRT differently, 
by using different control signals. For instance: 
we can apply a measured voltage to the height 
or "Y" plates of the CRT, moving the beam 
to a given vertical position, and another meas­
ured voltage to the sideways or "X" plates, 
controlling its horizontal position.1. EARLIEST SYSTEM: A LITTLE PROGRAM 
TO MAKE DOTS
The earliest setup connected a CRT to a
computer by the simplest possible means, and 
made its pictures with dots on the screen a 
sort of tattooing process.
It was simple because all the computer 
did was furnish to the connecting circuitry (or 
interface) symbols specifying how far up, and 
how far across the screen, the next dot should 
be. These symbols were actually coded numbers, 
and the interface turned them into voltages which 
then moved the beam correspondingly. (This 
process of making a measured voltage out of a 
coded numerical symbol is called digital-to-analog 
conversion, since (as explained on the other side) 
the main meaning of "analog" these days is "in 
a measured voltage.")
Now, this has several drawbacks. One ie 
lhat the lines are dotty; nobody likes that. A  
more important annoyance, though, is thal the 
computer scarcely has time for anything else.
Here ie a flowchart of what the computer has lo 
do in its program. (Even if you didn't look at 
the other side of the book, flowcharts are nothing 
scary. T hey're just maps of what happens.)2. LINE-DRAWING HARDWARE
The next step in design is to get the com­
puter program out of the business of drawing 
lines by a succession of dots. So we build a 
piece of hardware that the computer program may 
simply instruct to draw a line. As an interface, 
il looks to the computer like four separate 
devices: registers that tell where on the screen 
the line must start ("flrat X" and "first Y") and 
registers thal tell it where to stop ("end X" and 
"end Y").
O h wre|or«oo 3 
W e  jAMKj/e. fte
r a d  / f V e .
L o tFurthermore, and here was the indignity 
of it, this system took far too long. To draw 
a line with thirty dots in it took thirty times 
around the loop in the flowchart, and since each 
box in the flowchart takes at least one of the 
machine's rock-bottom instructions-- usually 
more-- then the main loop of this display routine 
takes four separate operations per dot, or 120 
operations for a stupid 30-dot line. Plainly 
there has to be a better way to use an expensive 
computer.
Actually it wasn't just the ignominy of it, 
but the fact that il took so long, that made this 
a poor method. The amount of stuff the compu­
ter could draw ln l/40th of a second— end Ihis 
turns out to be how fast the whole picture has 
to be made-- was too liltle. After l/40th of a 
second the human eye can see the lines on the 
CRT start to fade, and so the picture has to be 
redrawn to make it bright again before that 
happens. If your eye sees the picture fading, 
then when the compuier draws' the picture again 
you will see it get suddenly bright again— and 
it will start to Dicker. This is distracting, un­
healthy, and disagreeable.
Note that the mo 6l important computer in 
the Malory of computer display used this tech­
nique1, "o'his was the TX-2 at Lincoln Labora­
tories, a highly-guarded installation outside Bos­
ton which is formally part of MIT. The TX-2 
was one of the first transistorized computers-- 
perhaps Mie first; and on it were programmed a 
number of milestone systems, including Suther­
land's Sketchpad, Johnson's Sketchpad IV, and 
Baecker's GENESYS animation system (discussed 
somewhere).This speeds things up considerably, and 
allows the computer program to display on the 
CRT simply by telling the device what lines it 
wants drawn. Moreover, the program is free 
to do other things while each line is being 
drawn, though this involves the problem of how 
the program is to know when it's time to send 
out another line— and we needg't go into that 
here.
(Incidentally, it is a puzzling fact that 
such a device is available nowhere, although 
lots of people end up building one for themselves. 
There was such a thing on the market a couple 
of years ago-- line-drawing hardware with no 
interface and no CRT-- but it was withdrawn 
because of reliability problems. A just price, 
if anybody wants to go into that, would be five 
hundred to a thousand dolars— this year.)
3. EVOLUTION FROM THIS: TWO OPTIONS
There are basically two ways to go from 
this basic starting point. Either we can keep 
the display device intimately and integrally con­
nected to the computer, or we can say the hell 
with it and cut the display device loose as a 
separate entity.
Ivan Sutherland has cannily noled that 
there Is a certain trap involved in these designs: 
as we build additional "independent" structures 
lo take the burden of display away from the 
computer, we are tempted to keep adding fea­
tures which make the "independent" structure a 
computer in its own right. This paradoxical 
temptation Sutherland calls "the great wheel of 
Karma" of computer display architecture.
It is tempting to cut the display loose from 
the computer. It means the computer can be 
fully occupied with other matters than refreshing 
the screen-- preparing the next displays, per­
haps. Many computer people believe this is the 
right way to do it, and it is certainly one valid 
approach. But unfortunately it also drastically 
reduces the immediacy of the system's reaction, 
making interaction with the system less intimate 
and wonderful.
Approaches which put display refreshment 
and maintenance in a separate device are less 
interesting to me, and so that discussion contin­
ues separately nearby.

On the other eide of.the book, I explained 
that a computer la basically a zippy device, 
never mind how constructed, which follows a 
program somehow stored symbolically in a core 
memory. Such a device we call here a program 
follower. While programs may be In many com­
puter languages— all of them contrived systems 
for expressing the u se r's wishes, in different 
styles and with different general intent-- under­
neath they all translate to an inner language of 
binary patterns, which may Juat be thought of 
aa patterns of X and O, or light bulbs on and off. 
The innermost program follower of lhe computer 
goes down lists of binary patlem s stored in the 
core memory, and carries them out as specific 
instructions. It also changes its sequences of 
operations under conditions that the programmer 
haa told it to watch for.
. The most powerful and responsive com­
puter displays are those which build a second 
program follower which goes down lista of pic­
ture-drawing instructions also stored in the same 
core memory.

W e may call this also a "list-of-lines" 
system , since the commands recognized by the 
diaplay program follower are typically patterns 
that tell it what lines to draw.
Typically also it has its own way of Jump­
ing around In a program , and may jump to a 
specific Hat of Unea, or aubplcture, from numer­
ous other parta of Its program , always returning 
each time to the point from which it had Jumped. 
Thia -allows the same subpicture to appear in 
numerous places on the screen al the same time.
(A program that can be Jumped lo by other pro­
grams which then resume operation is called a 
subroullne; (hue the real, o r most prestigious, 
name for auch a device is a subroutining display ■)
This design has some extraordinary advan­
tages. One la that since the computer's program 
follower and the diaplay's program follower both 
share the aame core memory, they can work to­
gether most Intimately. When the user demands 
something new— by typing, say, or ^totaling 
with a light-pen—  the computer can atep in and 
take various actions. Ita program can compose 
a new picture for the user, get something from 
a dlak or tape memory, or switch lhe display's 
program follower over to a new picture it has 
already prepared.
Moat importantly, the compuier can move 
Images on the screen, allowing interactive ani­
mation on the screen under the user's control. 
Each time the display ia about to show the same 
picture again, the computer simply supplies it 
with a new starting point. Since the list of lines 
1s typically in the form of sequences of lines 
relative to one another, the picture is drawn In 
a new place each time— and thus seen to move 
on the screen.This design has some extraordinary advan­

Finally, the computer itself is free most 
of the time-- free, that is, lo do other things, 
which typically is always desirable. Jusl how 
much the computer can or should do in such a 
partnership is a matter of dispute. (Ordinarily 
such devlcea are spliced onto minicomputers; 
and minicomputer fans, such as the author, see 
no reason not to perform all services for the dis­
play there in the minicomputer— and a pox on 
the big machines. O thers, for various reasons, 
aee the subroudnlng display and its host mini 
as needing the tender ministratious of a blg- 
computer via some sort of communications line. 
There are various reasons for holding this en­
tirely legitimate view. People who are devoted 
to the high number-crunching capacity of big 
computers, o r to languages which require great 
big computers to run in, have a right to their 
opinion. Moreover, it is currently feasible lo 
store large bodies of data only on big computers 
-- not because big disk and tape memories can't 
be easily attached lo lhe small ones, for they 
can, but they usually aren't; and olher ways to 
tie minicomputers lo big stores of data aren't 
available yet.)
Subroutlning displays often have commands 
allowing them to display text as well as lines 
and dots. In the diaplay of lext they can use 
the same technique of "moving the picture" by 
starting ita diaplay at successively creeping 
points: this will cause, say, whole paragraphs 
to elide on the screen. The importance of 
this feature in the displaying of text cannot be 
overemphasized. As more and more people have 
experience with displays of different kinds, they 
are beginning to realize how confusing and dis­
orienting it is for a screen lo clear and be filled 
with something new to read. You don't know 
where you are. On subroulining displays, 
moving lhe lexl can give the reader the same 
sense of orientation he gels from turning pages 
-- an important thing lo replace.

It must be atressed here that, Juat aa com- 
putera themselves have no fixed mode or style 
of operation, neither do computer displays; and 
so the purpose of auch devices is almply
HELPING PEOPLE SEE AND MANIPULATE 
PICTURES AM D TEXT
IN ANY STYLE, AND FOR ANY PURPOSE.
Since pictures can be of anything, and text can 
be about anything, this effectively comprehends 
the entire mental and working life of mankind.
Many readers will scoff, supposing thal 
computer diaplay systems will always cost Iona 
of money. This is not the case. You can aJ- 
ready gel a beauty, wilh its minicomputer, for 
ae little aa $13,000; and this price should fall 
to three or four thousand within a few years—  
aa soon as the minicomputer manufacturers realize 
lhal the market frontier Is not in the office or 
factoi^, but in Ihe home. But w e're getdng a 
bit ahead of ourselves here.
TYPES OF SUBROUT1NING DISPLAY
Some early subroutlning displays used a 
screen-dotting technique, but took lhe burden of
il off lhe computer itself: it would extract from 
core memory the instructions telling it to draw 
individual lines and show text. (I refer here
lo the DEC model 338, introduced about 1965; 
this attached lo a PDP-8 computer (see p.*f3) 
and cost about $50,000 including the computer.) 
Others drew lines as straight zips of light acrosa 
the screen; an example is the IBM  2250 display,  
introduced about 1966. (The model 1  of this 
device buckled directly to the 360, and cost, f 
believe, something like $75,000; its successor, 
lhe model 4, buckled to their 1130 minicomputer, 
the package coaling some $150,000, and then 
you were supposed to attach It to an IBM  360.) 
The 2250 was a good machine, but in perfor- 
mance suffers greatly from the restrictions of

Seldom haa an event In a new fie ld  had auch power and 
Influence aa what dour Ivan Sutherland did aa a young man Ythe 
period 1960-64. *
The SK E T C H PA D  system,which was b asica lly  h ia  theela work ac 
HIT. was at once Inventive, profound, overwhelmingly impressive 
to laymen, and deeply elegant. Simply for the universal Influence 
I t haa had In the coaputer fie ld . I t  deserves our close atten tio n .
Sutherland waa one of the f lr a t people to  understand the uae 
of the computer In helping people v isu a liz e  th in g s that weren't 
fu lly  clear y e t—  the opposite, of course, of tha conventional 
notion of computers. While computers had been made to do snlmstlons 
as early as the f o rtie s , and computer graphics had been put to work­
aday duties In the old S A G E  system (defending us agalnat b » b tr »  lo 
the f i f t i e s — remember the good old days?), Sutherland turned com­
puter diaplay from sn expensive c u rio s ity  in to  a  tru e drssa Machine.
S K E T C H P A D  ran on the 36-blt TX-2, a one-of-a-kind experimental 
machine ac Lincoln Laboratories (a m ilita ry  research place nominally 
a p a rt of MIT). I t  had a diaplay screen, lig h t pen and lo ta  of handy 
switches.
S K E T C H P A D  was basically  a drawing system. But rsth e r than 
sim ulating paper (as some people might have d o n e), i t  found splendid 
ways to  take advantage of the computer's sp e c ia l c a p a b ilities.
In the Sketchpad system, Sutherland looked for ways that a 
responding conputer display screen could help people design things.
He pioneered methods of drswlng on screens, w ith such techniques 
as the “rubber-bsnd line" (s s tra ig h t line on th e screen, one snd 
of which fallows your lightpen while the oth er remains fixed), and 
the "Instance"—  a subpicture stored In core memory which could 
I a larger p ic tu re ).
T h is  p i c t u r e  v a g u ely

s i n g l e  m a s te r  p a tte r n .
S im u la te d  u i t h  GRASS  
la n g u a g e (a e e  p . 31),
The mind-blowing thing about Sketchpad was the way you could 
move and manlpulste the p icture on the screen, w ith a ll i t s  parts.
One o v e ra ll p ic tu re  could be constructed out of s hundred copies 
of a basic p ic tu re ; then a change tn  the baalc p ic tu re  would Im­
mediately be shown In a ll hundred places. Or you could expand 
your p icture u n til I t  waa e ffec tiv e ly  the size o f a football field  
(with you looking a t a tin y  view In the handkerchief-sized screen).
Or you could drsw meshing gears on the screen, and w ith the Ilg h t- 
pen (and through th e "co n strain t” f a c ility )  siake one gear turn by 
turning the other!
This elegant technique, the c o n stra in t.does not seem to hsve 
been Imitated even now. A  "constraint was a r e s tric tio n  placed 
on soae part of the o v erall stored p ictu re complex. Tha user 
could move or manipulate various parta of th a p ic tu re  on ths screen, 
but the p a rts thac had constrain ts could only move In certain  d i­
re c tio n s, or according to c ertain  formulas, or dragging other 
pares along, e t c . ,  as sp ecified.
This waa a profound idea, becauae I t  meant th a t any rulae for 
the manipulation of p a rtic u la r objects on the screen could be added 
to Sketchpad as n a rtlcu la ra  w ithin the larger program, rather than 
having to be program ed in from acratch.
(One extremely In terestin g  aspect of S u th erlan d 's th e sis, which 
moat people seem to have missed, d e alt with d isp lay in g  a atructure 
of c o n stra in ts: th a t 1s, showing what elemanta depended on what 
other elem ents, in  s highly sbstracted  diagram th a t the system could 
show you. This form of display has remarkable p o s a lb llltle s .
A fter his b r i lli a n t S K E T C H P A D  work, Sutherland was made head 
of AHPA's conputer branch (see "M ilitary ," p. 89 )• There he was 
Involved In many of the computer funding decielone of the late 
sLacies, which contributed to the impetus of c«*puter dlsplsy.
(His predecessor. L lck lld er, had been a pioneer In tim e-sharing, and 
much of the forward *>vement in the computer f ie l d  in recent years 
may Ju st have had to do with the stra teg ic  p o sitio n  of those two men 
when they were a t ARPA/IPT.)
Sketchpad went on as a continuing research tr a d itio n  a t Lin­
coln Labs. Timothy Johnson, for instance, made a  veralon of I t  that 
allowed the drawing of three-dimensional o b je c ts; th ia  became the 
forerunner of the varloua three-dimensional lin e  systems described 
hereabouts.
From A RPA , Sutherlsnd went on to the U niversity of Utsh, 
whence he slipped o ff with the Computer Science department chair­
man to found the Evane and Sutherland Computer Co-paoy, makera ol 
the to p -o f-th e -lin e  computer display aystema (aee p .J K V  and p-JA)?)-
Sutherlsnd1s work hss shown sn elegance and Inventiveness 
outstanding in the f ie ld . (For Instance, I believe one issue of 
C om inleations of the A C M  had two unuaual a r t i c l e s  by him: one de­
scrib in g  an eccen tric  ^ i n c s e  auction" system worked out for 
scheduling use of a casputer, which benefited ■ oc* ch*“ *“y
previous method; and th e Infamous "Great Wheel of Karma a rtic le , 
where he compared th e  design of graphical computers to the Hindu 
system of rein carn atio n —  If you keep adding d e sira b le  ”
the design, soon you hsve another prograa follow er and another com 
puter in the same bo*— over and over.)

How do computers make movies?
Well, first of all, computers do not make 
movies unless thoroughly provoked.
In fact, only people make movies. But 
computers, if sufficiently provoked, will do a 
lot of it: enact the movie and photograph it, 
frame by frame.
There is no single method.
All forms of computer display and computer 
graphics may be used to make computer movies.
"Computer animation" is any method of mak­
ing movies in which a computer successively 
draws or paints the successive individual frames, 
which may be done by any of the methods mention­
ed in this book. Now, since there are numerous 
methods of making pictures by computer, then any 
method of making different individual pictures, 
in a succession of changing frames, is computer 
animation. So a "computer movie" is any film 
made by, or with the picture-making aid of, 
computers.
In other words-- it's no one thing.
Now, there already exist hundreds, if not 
thousands, of computer movies. So far most of 
them have been on technical topics-- the mecha­
nics of satellite orbit stabilization, the 
mechanics of explosions and so on.
Here are a few stills from some other movies, 
more humanistic.

JOHN WHITNEY
John Whitney is the ancestor of us all, 
probably the first computer movie-maker. He 
is also a gripping speaker.
In the forties, he built a special anima­
tion stand-- using anal o r  computers.
Deeply concerned with music, ■Whitney has 
in his images emphasized rhythmic and c o n t r a ­
puntal movement of shapes and lines.

A talented artist with a feel for tech­

several years with Knowlton and others at 
Bell Labs. Her films with Knowlton, mention­
ed elsewhere, are marvelous. She now works 
at a more permanent setup, a minicomputer 
that runs successive images on a color TV 
screen, employing a modified form of Knowl- 
ton's EXPLOR language. The work is immediate­
ly viewable. This allows rapid film con­
struction,- not previously possible when the 
work had to go through a slow animation 
camera before she could see the result.

Bynow there are dozens of computer anima—

h t*ie influential animation systemsJ been Ron Baecker»s GENESYS, a 2-dimensional 
MTT^at^0n 8yBtem Pr°gra—Bed the late sixties at 
th “ klBh—security Lincoln Laboratory. (It used 
e TX—2 computer, mentioned elsewhere in this 
book.)
Baecker, a cheery and genial fellow, exp re e sec 
”tereBt as a student in using the TX-2 for anima­
tion, and was allowed to. The system he produced 
haa a number of lessons for us all.
GENESYS is a "Good-Guy” system,as discussed 
on p. I  — Meaning, in this case, th4t it is 
easy to learn and simple to use. As argued else­
where in this book, making computer systems clear 
and simple is often hard for the programmer (and 
may go against his grain), but is essential.
P IC T U R E S  AND MOTIONS
GENESYS makes the following alnpllficationa 
of your movie: all images are made up of dots.
They do not change as you watch; animation con­
sists of the images either moving or being re­
placed .
To create an Image, you draw it onto the 
screen with a llghtpen or a tablet. (Aa in the 
SKETCHPAD system; see p.  ^ 2 . J  ■) Parts of .the 
image may be changed until you're satisfied.
Now, to create the animation, you do the 
same thing. Each image can be made to move on 
the screen; and the path of the motion may be 
drawn on the screen, through the picture area. 
Not only that, but the timing of the motion is 
controlled through the same diagram, by the 
apacing of the dots. (Baecker calls hie control 
diagrams p— curves.)
Lastly, sections of picture may be re­
placed by meana of the control diagram (as 
indicated in picture above).
Having created such an animated sequence, 
which is stored in symbolic form in the com­
puter ("digitally"), you can view it on the 
screen, decide what you do and don't like 
about it, and change any part of It.
The basic elegance of the system la this: 
Baecker made everything work the same way, 
through control by screen dlagrama. He simpli­
fied the animation problem in s clear and simple 
way.
Ron now teaches in Canada and Is into work­
ing with PDP-11®- The results should be fun.LY N tl S n iT H
Lynn Smith is a young Boston artist 
Y°rked exL te?sively with Baecker's GENESYS (see nearby). One result has been 
a movie which should be an example to us 
all: "The Wedding Movie for Bob and Judy " 
(Her Friends Bob and Judy were getting 
married, so she made this movie, a few mi­
nutes long and quite clever, to celebrate 
xt.)
This is my favorite example of how 
computers should be used in the human 
world; it says more on the subject than 
any dozen articles.
(One question that remains unanswered 
is how a system like GENESYS could have 
been used for such a purpose, seeing that 
most people in the field believe GENESYS 
only rum on the heavily-guarded TX-2 com­
puter. Regretfully, I can shed no light 
on this here.)
are what you use to make ccxnputer movies. 
Basically they consist of a CRT and a movie 
camera in a box.
Mostly they are used to put text on 
microfilm by computer, so generally they 
are not connected to a computer but run 
off magnetic tape.
This turns out to be very annoying if 
you want to hook up the computer directly 
to the COM, and make movies that fill the 
frames spot-by-spot. For that you really 
need your own movie camera and a minicompu­
ter. (Movie cameras that can be made to 
Start and stop by computer are called "pulse 
caiuras" or "instrumentation cameras.")
The society for people who make Movies by 
Computer is called UAIDE * (Users of Auto­
matic Information Display Equipment an 
obsolete title).  It used to be a club just 
for companies that owned COMa made by 
Stromberg Datagraphlx, but evidently it haa 
now cut Itself loose and becane a subsidiary 
of the National Microfilm Association, 8728 
Colesville Road, Silver Spring MD 20910.
(NOTE: for them as want to make color 
movies, the two alternatives have been either 
to have separate primary negatives combined 
at a lab—  the "old Technicolor" process­
or to add a complicated color-filter box to 
a COH or other CRT setup. Such things are 
available conanercially now, from Dicomed—  
a whole Color COM.)

Hoonuar cm a Saturday in Urbana.  
It's mm-to-man among tha craters  
than a quick kill of tha unknown  
adversary.
k  hard end they play hard on th« mighty
W hen (he Author gets tire d  of Authoring, or the 
Student of Stewing, Just around the corner, a few 
keystrokes away, are diversions and games to boggle 
the Imagination.
Y ou can go to a program ("lesson ro se") and 
look at "the g reat roses"-- elaborate cu rlicu es gen­
erated by mathematical p atterns th at appealed to  the 
authors of that program; or fin d , also tucked In ro se . 
Conway's G am e of Life (see w riteup, p. * 1  £ >  , and p ie r 
Cure se ries, nearby).
Then there are gams you can play against the 
system, like racetrack and blecklack. (These games 
le t you win astronomical suns of money— play money, 
forgotten when you sign o ff.) Remnfcer, of course 
that you're not rea lly  playing against a cor—•»-- 1  
against a sp ed  ftc  program, with Its quirks 
shortcuts’ and blind spots.but
Then there are games you play by yourself —  
accually responding resources (see ip.*e,it-n), which 
entice you Into trying things out. Tenczar himself 
has created, two elegant, gem -1 Ike lessons, m an and 
plcto. which teach you co<q>uter programming without 
ever saying so. These two programs present the user 
with a little  picture of a m an on the screen, and 
shfM  him k w  the l it tle  m an m ay be roved around and 
nude to pick up pictures of balls. From  there on 
the student m ay have his way— and is never told that 
he's learning to program a true computer language. 
(Though It Is a quite restricted one, dealing ex­
clusively with lit tle  m en and their excursions am ong 
balls and falling stick v)Another charming game, I  don't know by wtww, Is 
celled candy factory. Here too the user may control 
the animation of the plctore by what he types. Ha- 
chlnes are seen to manufacture candy, box It and 
ship I f -  depending on what buttons you press.
Som e gams are played between people who sit 
together before a single P L A T O  terminal, often with 
teaching Intent. Such gams Include the hop' gam , 
where Bunny (you) and Frog (your friend) add their 
way along a board with numbered squares. Older chil­
dren can dig Hw the W est W a s (l+2)M 3. which Involves 
grouping the nuxbers you get by chance to try to get 
ahead of the other stagecoach.
T H E  "BIG B O A R D ” G A M E S
S till another category of gam s, though, M a lts 
the adult who craves real excitement. Because P L A T O  
has so many term inals, a ll over, there Is a curious 
coeA I  nation of anonymity and Intimacy between users 
(-- «uch lik e the curious Nonexistent Phone H ubert 
of Paris; In the French phone systen, people calling 
the sam  nonexistent phone n ixter can ta lk  to each 
other; strange blindfolded encowuers occur a t the 
MiMber o f The Day, spread by w ord-of^>uth; to n tin e s  
these resu lt tn people really  getting to g e th e r ...) ...
Anyway, Ihe Big Board gams of P L A T O  have exac­
tly  that*, a shared l i s t ,  or "Big Board," shoeing who 
Is playing the sp ecific gam.
But you don't have to use your rig h t n n e ,
In this Jaunty society of shadws, you pick your 
own noni de guerre, or fighting nane. This has ni»- 
erous advantages: the ™ >lt obvious Is that as you Im ­
prove a t play, you can shed the Identity In which you 
have been humiliated.
The main gams with Big Boards are that old 
standby, spacewar (rocketshlps wheeling and firin g  
a t each oth er and slid in g  aroiaid on the screen); 
dogfight (biplanes wheeling and firin g  a t each other 
and siTding around on the screen), moonwar (shootingVtA> fran your Bova spaceship in-  
oludes perspective viau of where  
you are among billion* of atom  
and your various control*.
Tha navigation part o f ____
already working. .To get around  
you need instruction; hars ue  
are at tha Training Can tar.
Walcane to tha Hop  Gam e. 
PLATO often usee animated  
opening titles.Hare it is Bunny's  turn. Screen 
inatructa you personally:
''Press -NEXT- to Spin, enrrintruda".a t the other guy by specified angles as you stand 
• * " !  c ra ters). In addition. PLA TO  offers (net during 
Marking hours) whet lajst be two o f the K>st baroque 
space-war gams anywhere, empire (eight races (the 
Vulcanlans, Kllngons, e tc.) seek to c a u ro l the g al­
axy) and nova (slw la ted  navigation w n j  a ll lions of 
d ifferen t M a rt and solar sy ste a s, a ll of which m ay 
be rcvl si ted, all of rfilch are d if f e r e n t...)
People who only play PL A T O  gam s occasionally 
have to sign on. by typing th e ir nem s Into the big 
board. (They often get slaughtered by tha regulars). 
The regulars— hah. W hen th e y 're  signed Into the 
sy stea, they have m rcly  to Jix^i to  a specific gam 
for th eir flg h tln 1  nams to be posted on the big 
board. A  mighty ro llc e ll they make, too— such great 
w arriors as yon Pave, lo t, frig h t p ilo t , A L  9000, 
Sliq>son, doc, T H E  R E D  B A R O N , The Red Sweater, Tta 
Clam Pud, F odzllla, tig re ss, e n n a  salad, Conan, 
Siddhartha, wonder p lg l!!!!, and EXO RCIST.
(As those Instders who hava aut<M tlc slp i-w  
to  Big Boards w rite programs to do the slgn-tsi, th eir 
a rriv a l tn a Big Board gam Is o ften  an animated 
slgh-on. The cutest trick is TH E R E D  BARON's: It lo ^S  
lik e th is.
T H E  R E D  B A R O N  |* ^  * —
It wocks like th is . For dogfight, the terainal a l­
ready has stored In Its te^iorery m n r y , as "char­
a c te rs ."  the l i t t l e  pictures a f airplanes that are 
going to buzz around the screen. So the Baro^ Just 
fo llw s  his n am w lth  the code for th at special char­
a cte r.)
One last point. N o  longer can you sign on with 
an obscenity: a l i t t l e  obscenity-checking prograa 
looks for the usual expletives. In case v isito rs or 
o th er priggish folk might be looking. But of course 
th la Is easy to circumvent by p u ttin g  periods between 
the le tte rs  of your nasty wird, or something sim ilarly 
deceptive to the poor progreij.

TO MOVE VITRIN A USSOti, basic actions are BEXT (to go fonaard or  
tall the system it's its turn; BACK, which sane times returns you to  
earlier points  in  the sequence of your lesson; and six step-out-of-llne  
options, by whiah tha author may permit the user to sidestep to ex­
planations, enrichment notarial, or things oul of sequence.

The original idea was evidently that there Mould be a basic sequence,  
in which NEXT and BACK would  be the fonjard and back controls, and  
the other six uould represent Help for the Confused, a  "Lob" allowing 
experiments, and additioml Data the student decides ha needs. Tha  
three  trttJi Shifts simply provided a second option of each type.
Bou the  author might use these, however, was his own affair.
TERN" evidently was for when students wanted things Looked Op: by  
pressing TEfft and typing the unknown word, the student would get a  
definition. " , ANS" suggested that it might also be used when the  
student  uza allowed the option of being told the answer.
Bote the arrows over 6,U,E,AJD,Z,X,C. They allow the student to move  
cursors, draw, point directions, etc. Unfortunate confusion ensues  
with the left-arrow on tha far left, used  tn  programing (aa in APL;  
eee p. 71).)
ERASE allows the student to correct his input; COPT helps edit and  
change things. SUP and SUB allow superscripts and subscripts;
FOITT MICRO is like a special shift key, going into whatever special  
font is currently stored on the terminal. I have no inkling of what  
the little square means.ts iru e m ^ T o  T»«r?
*A tutor who tooted the flute  
Tried to tutor two tutors to toot.
But he asked through his snoot:
is i t  better to toot  
Or to tutor two tutors to toot?"
Folk thing
The T U T O R  language grew out of d rill-an d - 
practiee, for which I t  hae a ccanand specifying 
where a stu d e n t'• answer ie  to appear on tha 
ecreen. Thle ia Che 'arrow* comand. The lan ­
guage haa a strange ecanning structure b u ilt 
around th is 'u r i w - command, much ae the T R A C  
Language (Bee pp. 18-21) hae a ecanning etruc- 
ture b u ilt around parentheses and comae. Be- 
ginnere don’t  need to  understand Che scan and 
the a r m  conand, but Journeymen do.
T E N C Z A R ‘S C O N C E P T  O F  A  C O N C E P T
M uch hae been mads of TU TO R'S fac ility  
for 'analyzing the content* of what etudante 
type in . A ctually, of couree. the coqniter 
does not "understand* what the etudent eaye 
(see 'A r tif ic ia l In telligence/ - tl),
but rath er o ffers certain e ffic ie n t tricke to 
the person using T U T O R  to  prepare preeenta- 
tional m eterlels.
Basically, TUTOR'a "concept* fac ility  
reducee every input word to a 60- b lt code.
The technique of reduction (celled a 'hashing 
function’ ) supposedly eubetltutee for any 
■ord of any language a code of 60 b its (aee 
■Binary Petterne," p. 13), which meena the 
prograa in  T U T O R  can rapidly teat a student's 
input for numroue differen t poeeible thlnga. 
(The power of th is technique w ill be readily 
recognized by computer people; unfortunately 
there ie no r o a  to  explain i t  further here.)
Thus a T U T O R  program may contain 'concept 
searches* th et te st whether a student typee 
eith e r a deeired reeponse or n rn ro u s e lte r- 
natives-  While i t  m ay b m  etranga to c all 
thia a "concept,* I t  ie a powerful technique.
Paul Tenczar'e T V T O R  language, the pro­
gramming language ineida PLA TO , ie  lik e any 
other prog reaming language (see pp. 15-31) i 
in tric ate, and unlike lea reaulte. Thet ie, 
a program baara no more resemblance to what 
I t doea than the word "cow" leoke like a c a .
P L A T O  le  a ays tern for canned presencetions 
that reepond to  the student. Studente need 
not know TUTO R. Anyone out to prepere such 
presentations must learn i t .  howeveri and the 
attempt hae diecouraged many.
Tenczar ie  a former biologlet, and had no 
preconceptlone from computer orthodoxy to bind 
. . .  . j - , 0f T U T O R . Thus the lan-
„ v.ig ln a l. There le only rooa
b the following points:
To learn the f ir e t atape In TUTOR-- how 
to se t up dr 111-and-practice lessons, for in ­
stance— is unusually easy.
To do anything cof>lex, however, requires 
you co learn the bulk of the T U T O R  language.
Thus when people say T U T O R  le 'eaay." they 
men those f i r a t  steps.
T U T O R  le not Extensible, lik e, say. T R A C  
Language (eee pp. 18-19) or G R A S S  (aee p.**^l). 
That i t ,  e program er cannot cuauxeiza the 
language with new ctapound functione of hie 
own aaking. Stepe are being taken to  correct 
thiej meanwhile, i t  la said that the Urbana 
people can be persuaded to put in new cm anda

*THREE-DIMENSIONAL LINE DISPLAYS
So far we've discussed the two-dimensional 
subroutlning displays. However, things do not 
by any means stop there. A number of people 
in the early days experimented with techniques 
for drawing line pictures by program; the ear­
liest of these uaed plotters. output devices that 
let the program draw with a pen. Bul interest 
soon grew in the possibility of Interactive three- 
dimensional displays on screens. Johnson's 
Sketchpad 4 did this entirely by program. But 
ab night follows day, people set about putting 
these techniques Into hardw are, creating devices 
that would automatically show things in three- 
dimensional views— allowing the viewer to 
rotate views of nonexistent objects aa If they 
w ere on unseen turntables. ~
The views we are talking about, now, co 
sist of bright lines on a dark Reid, and so the 
"objects" we are talking about are called "wire­
frame1 ' objects—  they could effectively be made 
of welded wire. But now we do not have lo 
build them phyaically lo Bee them.
Basically a three-dimensional system of 
this type stores the lines as coordinates in threes: 
endpoints of lines in a mythical three-dimensional 
space. Each point’s location in Ihe space is told 
by Ihree numbers (example showing a house 
may be seen on p. ); a line in a space is 
represented in the data structure by two such 
points, and a code or something tying them to­
gether.
The second program follower in such a 
device behaves much as it does in the 2D system.  
but with certain additions. Like the 2D system, 
il proceeds down its own program one step al 
a time. Like the 2D system, it find9 in its 
program the coordinates of a line to diaplay and 
creates electronic signals representing its end­
points. Bul it does not diaplay these directly, 
since theae are three-dimensional coordinates. 
Instead it rouleB these signals lo what we may 
call a view calculator, a particular piece of hard­
ware that has been primed with the angle from 
which you want lo view the object. This view 
calculator, automatically and by mysterious means 
which vary among machines, produces lhe view, 
and it9 signals go lo the screen.
Let's say we want to display a point. The 
display's program follower pulls three numbers 
from ils display list and notes the code that says 
il's a spatial point and nol the end of a line.
These three numbers slide on into the view cal­
culator, already primed wilh the angle of rota­
tion; and the view calculators figgers where on 
the screen that point should be displayed.  The 
coordinates for the screen—  telling where the 
point goes in lhe desired picture— go to the 
Bcreen controller, and the point is brightened.
How are these coordinates calculated?
Well, some commercial units do it electronically 
("in analog") and some do it symbolically ("in 
digital"). The result is the same.
(If you wanl the equations for this, they're 
in the Newman and Sproull book.)
Then how does the view calculator handle 
a line? Same thing.
The program follower pulls three numbers 
from its diaplay list and notes Ihe code lhat says 
it's a line, so il takes three more. Then the 
view coordinates of both points are calculated 
and fed lo the screen controller. The screen 
controller now he6 two points on ita screen—  
so it draws a line between them-
The f i r s t  device of th is  type was, I th in k , 
th e  so -ca lle d  Kludge (pron. "K lo o j"-- computer slang 
fo r a rid ic u lo u s machine, but in  th la  case applied 
a ff e c tio n a te ly )  b u ilt a t MIT'a E le ctro n ic Sysceoa 
Laboratory in  the early  s i x t i e s .  Thia device was 
a o n e -o f-a-k in d , b u ilt out of D EC  c irc u it cards and 
hooking to a bigger machine. The ESL Kludge showed 
v iv id ly  how good I t  was to  have Instantaneous view 
c alc u la tio n  under a u s e r's  control*
The first of these systems lo be offered 
commercially, I believe, was the "Adage Display," 
made by Adage. Inc. of Boston, which used Iheir 
unusual Ambilog computer (see p . *f.3>  t0 f®4 * "  
objects on the screen. I vaguely recall thal it 
cost about $00,000 with computer bul without ac­
cessories .Actually Adage had a tremendous lead in 
thia field, but they let it slip for some reason, 
and have now lost it to two firms: Evans and 
Sutherland on the high end. Vector General on 
the low end. (But of course things keep chan­
ging.)
The Evans and Sutherland Computer Com­
pany was founded In 1966 by Ivan Sutherland, 
creator of the masterful Sketchpad system, and 
David Evans, chairman of computer science at 
the University of Utah. (For a time both held 
appointments at U2 at the same tin e, but now 
both have left the university to devote full dme 
to their dream factory in Salt Lake City.)
T heir first product was an extraordinary 
piece of hardware called the LDS-1, which they 
said Innocently stood for Line Drawing System. 
(To anybody from Utah, however. LDS means 
Latter-Day-Saint, and don'l you forget it. Evans, 
indeed, is a Mormon, but I've been told it may 
have been Sutherland's sense of humor that 
chose the acronym.)
It should be pointed out that a special ad­
vantage of digital perspective calculation la that 
viewed coordinates can be read back by the com­
puter, and serve as new dala, if you go for 
that sort of thing.

3 D  screens— aside fro a  th e ir  fun and excite­
ment— allow people to understand and work with 
couples 3D  e tru c tu res w ithout having to  build them 
physically.
The understanding, however, cones from being 
able to turn and in < p n iir>  th e stru c tu re  on the 
screen. If you can’t  turn I t  you c a n 't rea lly  
perceive the 3 D  s tru c tu re , because the arrangement 
of lin es could be anything -
However, systems lik e  the Adage and the Vector 
General and the Evans and Sutherland devices allow 
you to turn things on the screen as e a sily  as If 
they were on turntables behind a pane of g lass. 
T h at's how you see, you eee.
This Interactio n  is what makes coaputer d is­
play augur a new era for mankind, I f  w e're lucky. 
( I t 's  slso  why we use the term computer display 
In th is book, rsth e r than "computer graphic*," 
sines people who mske coaputers draw w ith pens are 
aleo doing "conputer graphics"—  a rela te d  a ctiv ity , 
but not one to change the w orld.)
The Adage Diaplay Is isometric. meaning 
that lines dp not get shorter as ihey get farther 
away or longer as they get closer. While thia 
ia marvelously impressive, most people want 
real perspective; and it was this lhat Evans and 
Sutherland set sbout to make available in real 
lime, i.e ., In direct response to the viewer's 
actions.
The LDS-1, weighing in at half a million 
dollars or so, buckled to the PDP-10, a big 
36-bit computer from DEC (aee p . ^ O ).  Its 
view calculator worked symbolically (digitally), 
and thu9 could work lo Ihe higher precialon 
necessary for true perspective calculation.
Among the exciting demonstrations that 
you can see altting at an LDS-1 are a map of 
the United States you can zoom in on. bringing 
you in to a map of New Jersey ,  then Atlantic 
City, then a specific intersection, all in one 
smooth continuous motion. Also a simulated 
landing on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier 
— with you flying the airplane, so you can 
go over il, to the side, into the drink or straight 
at the carrier. In all cases the ghostly ship 
will move, turn and change perspective on the 
screen as if somehow it were really there.
Several LDS-Is were sold.
Meanwhile a little new firm of young guys 
in Southern California, Vector General, came up 
with a line of terminals like the Adage line, ex­
cept that they could buckle to the 16-bll minicom­
puter of your choice. (In practice most of them 
have been attached to PDP-Us; see p. VL-)
The Vector General display Is isometric, 
and makes its calculations in analog, like the 
Adage Display. It has been very successful a- 
mong both universities and private corporations.
In addition, a highly interactive and well- 
designed language is available for lhe creation 
of data structures representing 3D  objects, as 
well as for general-purpose programming and the 
creation of whole environments. And it's free 
to individuals or companies thal have Vector 
General displays attached to PD P-lla. (See 
"Coup de GRASS," p.5H3/*)
But wait. Evans and Sutherland has now 
dropped the LDS-1 and given u s-- no, not LDS-2, 
but something called The Picture System— also 
built onto the PDP-11, but this one works sym­
bolically (digitally) and in full perspective. The 
price starts at eighty grand.
Since the Picture System works out of Ihe 
PDP-11 core memory, the commands it follows 
are 16 bits long, since that's lhe size of a slot 
in PDP-11 core. But wait. They've designed 
the thing to convert to 36 b its, so that coordin­
ates are moved to a private store or buffer be­
tween the program follower and the display.
This means lhe display can zoom and zip around 
in the scene without bothering the computer.UNFORTUNATELY, just to get through the basics, 
there is only room to discuss stick-figure 
graphic display here. But curved surfaces 
may also be depicted, though usually not inter- 
actively. See below, and pp.

Another Important feature of The Picture 
System: it will do, not just ordinary perspective, 
out such weird view calculations as wideangle 
barrel distortion, pincushion distortion and 
similar stuff.Sutherland Evans

The rules of perspective have been under­
stood since the Renaissance. In olden computer 
times (up till about 1B65) people used to do 
three-dimensional view calculation by angles 
relative to a three-dimensional data structure. 
Then Larry Roberta at MIT noted lhat there was 
a more appropriate mathematical method, long 
molderlng in obscure texts. The idea is this:
If you sdd an extra dimension lo the data. It's 
easier to program. It's easier because it be­
comes a simple matrix multiplication, which has 
no commonaense explanation but la important to 
mathemallclana.
SO thal means that to calculate views of 
three-dimensional objects, the moat usual way 
ie now to add that extra dimension. Instead of 
having a point in apace whose position la 36-24- 
36 (in some sel of three-dimensional coordinates).  
another arbitrary number is added to make it, 
say, 36-24-36-1.
It seems that in Lhe mathematics of multiple 
dimensions, it comes out simpler that way. in­
deed. from a mathematical point of view the new 
improved dimension is just like the other three.  
For this reason, such an augmented system of 
coordinates la called homogeneous coordinates.  
Like homogenised milk, the additional coordinate 
Is just stirred In with the rest, and out comes 
your desired view calculaticm. (The formulas 
are to be found In Newman and Sproull, Princi­
ples of Interactive Computer Graphics. McGraw. 
$15, your basic text on the subject.)
At any rate the additional coordinate is 
often referred to. incorrectly, as the "homogen­
eous coordinate.” They're aU homogeneous, 
which la why It works.*

General idea of 3-D halftone.
Polygon Systems.
halftone image  
synthesisThere are m ore ways than one  
to produce shaded pictures with com puter,!*.  
Here are the methods  
of the 'polygon school.’
bj Theodor H. Nelson
The Nelson Organization
To most people in the compulcr field, "computer 
graphics'' means tine drawing—systems and programs 
Tor mapmaking, pipe layout, automobile and aircraft 
design, or any other acliviiy where a  diagram may 
help. Using line-drawing programs and equipment, 
designers may create line drawings on last-responding 
graphic screens, reworking (heir ideas until satisfied; 
the system then disgorges polished drawings and speci­
fications for the designer’s real intent, something else 
that is to be made or done. But it is possible for a 
picture itself—instructive, interesting or pretty— to be 
the goal, tn that case wc will often wanl pictures lhal 
look like things instead of wires. A picture lhal is nol 
all black and white we call "halftone."
With much secrecy and a  slow start, compuier 
halftone systems are now being built all over. The 
methods are extremely different from one another; 
only the outputs are similar. Some exist in software, 
some have already been built into spccial hardware.These systems have many potential uses for visualiza­
tion, animation and new kinds of photography, in 
art, scholarship, motion pictures and TV; for visual­
izing worlds lost and imagined, equipment yet unbuilt, 
the responsiveness of aircraft. It may not be long 
until moviemakers can buy different brands of picture 
synthesizer, just as musicians choose today among 
Moog, Buchla and ARP music synthesizers. But none 
is in production yet, This is an attempt to review the 
coming apparatuses of apparilion.
Not only is the field of halftone one of the most 
exciting in computing; it is also one of ihe nuttiest and 
most secretive. For instance, at one lime a Arm that 
was supposedly marketing its halftone system declared 
ihe present author persona n o n  grata  and not to be 
communicated wilh in any way, though information 
was freely available to others. “I don’t think it's 
necessarily paranoia," says Rod Rougelot of General 
Electric. "A lot of guys started about the same time, 
and proceeded in a heads-down manner.” It took a 
special kind of initiative to head off in lhat direction 
wiih no external provocation. “All those heavy calsfrom arm  and kit were saying in ihe sixties I could  
never do a Mickey Mouse,” says Lee Harrison m of  
Computer Image, “Bui I'm noi that kind of researcher.
1  talk to the Lord.”
The systems" stories art u  different u  lhe systems  
ihemselvs General Electric’s system grew out of  
cockpil displays for blind (lying. The system of Penn­
sylvania Research Associates began wilh terrain and  
radar modelling. The system of maci (Mathematical  
Applications Group, Inc.) began wilh the siudy of  
radiation hazards in  battlefield machinery. Two system  
families, that of Compuier Image Inc. and my own  
Faniasm, were designed from the beginning for movie­
making. especially "special eflects" and puppeieering.  
The moai poignant tale may be that of La Harrison,  
whose struggling family was warmed through ajJd  
winters by the tuba of Iheir analog computer.

symbols having different grey-values.
Various other lyiletnj have allowed users to create  
their own original 2-D pictures. But the natural temp­
tation is to want the computer really to make ptcnm.  
Why not have the computer produce a photographic  
picture directly from the 3-D representation of objecu?  
Computers don'l do this by nature, any more than  
ihey do anything else by nature, so how it may bt  
done by computer is very interesting. The problem is  
also intersting because of iis intuitive nature. Vision*  
of scenes in space are around us constantly, and we  
intuitively understand the groinclry of outlines and  
light. As 3-D work progresses large problems are being  
overcome. The famed "hidden line problem,” for ex­
ample, was misleadingly couched, since the problem  
is noi finding what lines are hidden, bul wbal Surface*

We musl draw on ibi* undemanding of scenes (o  
figure out how 10 make pictures, (or there is no  
mathematically elegant or preferable approach. Scene*  
are geometrically rich, and thus many different tech­
niques may be uaed to extract pictures from them.  
These techniques may look al plana/ structures, ipatial  
interconnections, relative edges of intersections or  
anything else you can define and p n m s. I prefer to  
think of compiler halftooe as like trick photography  
ol the kind done in Hollywood: a variety of tech­
niques can be combined in various ways. As in trick  
photography, the number of loudies and enhance­
ments that you add generally determines how good  
it will look, regardless of what system you begin wilh.
The simplest systems are those lhat depict objects  
made of polygons—that is. planes wilh straight edges.  
We will discuss such systems in the present installment.
The wild polygoa yonder
At least two companies are building image systems  
that will behave and respond like onrushing reality.  
Such a system, hooked lo cockpit-like controls, can  
show a trainee pilot ihe delicate and precipitous results  
of what he docs. Realistic action. rather than surface  
detail, is crucial.
Tbe techniques of action polygon halftone were  
originally developed by General Electric, ol Syracuse,  
N.Y.. and are now also under development al Link  
Division of Singer Company (makers of the beloved  
pilot trainer and its progeny). Basically such sysiems  
operate upon the scan-lines that crisscross a television  
screen, switching the color of ihe running scan as it  
crosses from polygon to polygon.
The action polygon school—GE and Link—takes  
a curious but effective approach to halftone TV: iheir  
"environments" are composed entirely of convex objects  
made entirely of convex polygons. To use only convex  
objects (no dents) means lhal one object may be in  
front of another or vice veraa, but never both. (An  
object with apparent indentations, such as an airplane,  
has to be made oul of a group of convex objects flying  
togethcc.) To use only convex polygons (notchless)  
makes il easy for the system to decide, at a given  
instant, whether the scan ii crossing the polygon or not.The edge-box reports summed into the facet boxes,  
each of which was set to respond to a particular  
combination of left-right, above-helow reports. Al Ihc  
instant all the facet's edge boxes replied in the proper  
preset combination, ihe facet box signalled lhal its  
owd facet was being crossed by the scan-line. When  
more lhan one faect-box responded, the one nearest  
the viewpoint had its color gated to tbe screen.
Now Rouge lot's group is replacing the old nasa 
system by a new nasa system, which works on entirely  
different principles, but keeps ihe vector calculator.  
The old one could show scenes with up to 240 edges;  
tbe new has* system will at least double lhal. GE’s new  
method is already operational on smaller research fa­
cilities. They don'l tell what it is, bul basically it in­
volves sorting by distance. Supposedly the sort method  
is good enough to make the old edge boxes obsolete.
The Link group claims competitive performance for  
iheir system, which will go to black-and-white ihou-  
saod-line TV. They say their system is different, better,  
and secret.
Campus o f Fooled U. ( CE)The method of Gary Watkins is the resuh of a  
profound search at ihe University of Utah for rte  
method— a polygon techniqi* fast enough for real­
time enactment, but cheaper than the GE-type systems

Instantaneous enactment: halftone animation  
|iv«s a sanaa of laally being there. (Bod Rouaelol,  
General Electric)
This work evolved in part from GE's work in the  
fifties with a "ground plane simulator.” a system that  
would show a correct representation of the ground's  
pcnition, dipping and routing, lo the pilot of an air­
craft in fog or night. In 1963 the General Electric  
group, under Rod Rougelol, worked out for nasa  the 
design ol an "environment simulator"—a device thal  
would simulate the appearance and performance of  
any equipment. Thb is now called Ihe "old nasa  sys­
tem  It permitted ihe user— seated before a color TV 
screen—lo work controls for an imaginary aircraft or  
spacecraft, and see roughly what the pilot of the craft  
would sec, flying in real time through a breathtaking  
color scene. Films made on Ihis machine have been  
stunning. Imaginary cilics. roller coasters and aerial  
dogfights arc among the visions that can be preen led.
General Electric- ! old n a sa method is fairly weird  
if not mischievous. The earlier "ground plane simu­
lator" had shown an edge (ihe horizon) digitally dis­
played on a crt: the system was extended to many  
edges, and the logical analysis of areas between them.Wyiie-RooDey: to o l Ike wuriu
The Wylie-Romney method, disclosed in 1967, was  
ihe firsi generally publicized procedure for making  
halftone pictures. Indeed, the 1967 publication sig­
nalled the explosion of Ihc University of Uuh into  
the forefront of computing research.
The Wylie-Romney method was actually the joint  
work of Chris Wylie. Gordon Romney. David C. Evans  
and Alan Erdahl: but much of ihe impetus for ils  
development came from Evans, chairman of computer  
sciences at Utah, who had long suspected the possibil­
ity of 3-D halfione synthesis.

The scenc was represented by a collection of edge  
boxes, physically jumpered into a collection of facet  
boxes. Each edge box and facet box was loaded with  
certain numerical and logic values, representing edges  
and facets in the scene, which could change between  
frames as required by the action.
In the preprocess for each frame the old Nasa sys­
tem used a specially built digital compuier. Ihc "vec­
tor calculator." This performed al great speed the  
three-part vector calculations necessary to determine  
all scene positions, including the positions and slams  
of all edges. Each individual edp generator, loaded  
wilh ils own edge position, constantly1  reported whether  
the running scan of the picture was to the left or right  
of its own edge. It dutifully guarded this edge from  
border lo border of the picture.

point desired in Ihe final picture, shoot a searching  
ray through the scene al a corresponding angle. Find  
where this searching ray hits every surface in ils way.
Since ihe locations in space of these hii-points are  
easily calculated, figure their distances from the vantage  
point. The nearest of Ihe intersections b the visible  
one. Look up the color of that surface and shade the  
output point accbrdingly.
This may sound inefficient, but il is comparatively  
easy to ascertain ill ihe piercing-poinis. since the sur­
faces to be hit in a given scanning row can be largely  
predicted from Ihe previous row.
John Wamock's method, also from Utah, is unre­
lated to the other methods, bul has qualities mathe­
maticians like, as well as a certain whimsy.
Consider a square in the picture area. (At the start  
consider the whole picture area.) Now ih e n .  Test  
whether the present square is entirely filled with one  
color If so, output a corresponding square all of that  
color. If the present square is not all one color, divide  
it into four smaller squares. Take another square and  
go back to Now th e n .  End the process when each of  
ihe squares in ihe broken-down picture has been  
completely filled wilh one color—or the unsatisfied  
squares are loo smaD lo care aboul.

Suppose lhat we have some data structure represent­
ing a three-dimensional object, and a halftone method
lo search oul its visible surfaces. How do we shade the  
output points? What do we take into account: how  
combine the basic pcys or colon, how blend them  
with computations of surface angle, distances from the  
vantage point, or anything ehe we can think of?
Tbe answer: any way al all. The combining function  
is an aesthetic choice. There are not many areas left  
where you can make up a mathematical hodge-podge  
and get pleasing or interesting m ulti Computer half­
tone is a felicitous exception: you can augment by  
adding or multiplying, diminish by subtracting or divid­
ing. and yet always come up with an image resembling  
something. Anyone who has worked in a darkroom  
will recognize lhal this is L ik e  enlarging: playing wilh  
parameters won't obliterate the piciure.
There are purists who insist that halftone coloration  
should exactly follow the formulas that simulate the  
behavior of real light. For some purposes, like pilot  
training, this may often be-true. But insisting on mathe­
matical accuracy as a general principle is like insbting
oo ultra-high fidelity—an aesthetic judgment couched  
as a mechanical imperative.
Until now Ihc output hardware was not really ready  
for halfione. Five yean ago a computer could usuaDy  
create halftone pictures only on a line printer or s 
4020 microfilm plotter. Today there are many different  
photographic printers, going lo a ll sizes of film and  
paper; one even uses a laser. There are various display  
terminals permitting grey-scale and ookx halftone oo  
TV screens.
The age of computer image synthesis has begun.  
Polygon systems are fast and simple, and will come  
to be used in our daily lives for such diverse purposes  
as motecul? nudy, the memorization of delivery routes,  
and visualization of every kind of layout and doign.  
They will be fundamental to our new world of  
coamuter display. □

THE PLOT SO FAR.
Various computer methods now make i t 
possible to create artificial photographs of 
three-dimensional objects or scenes represented 
in the computer's storage. This is done by 
coloring or shading points in an output picture 
like the points in the scene that can be sighted 
through them from the vantage point. What 
the methods really boil down to, though, are 
searching processes in the data representation 
of the three-dimensional scene.
In an earlier article we have considered 
some of the techniques being used to depict 
simple scenes-- those made up of polygons.
Now we turn to more elaborate scenes which add 
shadows, surface patterns and curvature.
One of the most interesting things about 
this branch of computer graphics—  already seen 
in the polygon methods discussed earlier—  is 
the variety of techniques that can be employed. 
Moreover, these methods, for all their sophisti­
cation, can usually be intuitively understood 
as thought they were operations performed on 
objects in space. The same continues to be true 
for the more complex systems.O F  R E A L IT Y

In the methods discussed so far, we looked 
at several computer techniques for photograph­
ically depicting scenes and objects made up of 
polygons—  planar facets-- in a represented 
three-dimensional Beene. Imaginary houses of 
cards, cardboard airplanes and triangular scen­
ery take on a compelling vividness when depicted 
by the computer. And for visualizing such 
things as architectural arrangements, such 
systems promise to be of increasing practical 
value.
Those of us interested in the artistic 
aspects of computer halftone images want more. 
This article looks at some ways to add the 
appearance of curvature and surface pattern 
lo computer-synthesized images.BOUKNIGHT AND KELLEY:
PICKING THROUGH A CAT'S CRADLE
The method of Bouknight and Kelley, at 
the University of Illinois, permits the addition 
of shadow to polygon pictures. Their method 
uses an intricate system of scanning sweeps 
across the 6cene, analyzing the successive edge- 
crossings. For each output line, a list of the 
edges in the scene is ordered according to which 
will be next encountered. To make a specific 
output line of shaded points, we step through 
successive positions of the scan-line, until an 
an edge is crossed. With each edge we cross, 
we enter or leave at least one facet. Of all 
the current facets we are in after a given edge- 
crossing, the system finds out the nearest one, 
the visible one, by comparing distances. The 
coloration of this facet is then fed out to the 
picture, until the next edge-crossing.
Bouknight and Kelley expand their method 
to show shadows by an additional step. They 
create a new list of edges to be encountered, 
this one relative to scans from the light source. 
Then, during the regular output picture scan, 
they look to this latter data to see about shadow. 
As soon as they know two consecutive edgea 
of a visible object in the picture, they are able 
to search the ahadow-edge list to see if any 
shadow-edges impinge between them. The final 
list of edges-- visible facet edges and shadow 
edges-- goes to the picture output device.
BOUKNIGHT-KELLEY METHOD
MAGNUSKl’S PATTERNED CONSTRUCTIONS
A number of contributions have been made 
by individuals working alone. For instance, 
Henry Magnuski, at M.I.T., created a program 
that repeatedly positions patterned facets in 
space to make large constructions.
This program did nol calculate "true" 
shadow, basing its shading partly on angle of 
surfaces. Neither does it show true curves.
Yet it shows the impressive degree to which 
such effects may be approximated. The result­
ing beach ball picture is reminiscent of Moorish 
architecture.MAGNUSKI'S CONSTRUCTIONS OF REPEATED PATTERNS

A fundam ental type of system we may call 
the "sim plex" system  w as exemplified in the 
p revious article b y  the Wylie-Romney p ro g ram .
A sim plex technique sim ply projects sim ulated 
ra y s toward the scene from the vantage point 
till they hit the rep re se n te d  objects, and fills 
co rresponding positions on the output picture 
w ith the colors en countered on the front su rfa c e s 
of objects in the scene.
The same p rin c ip le  extends naturally to 
scenes w ith cu rv ed  and otherw ise em bellished 
o b jec ts.
Robert M ahl, at the U niversity of U tah, 
h as recently reported his resu lts with sim plex 
methods using q u ad ric su rfaces— those cu rv ed  
su rfaces generated by mathematical pow ers of 
two. His p ictu res-- like the cup and saucer 
shown here— have a p leasin g  1920s B auhaus- 
like quality.
One problem  with this method is that 
computational com plexity increases rapidly as 
th e scenes grow more complex; the more su rfa c e s 
and p ierc in g -p o in ts, the more tim e-consum ing 
(and expensive) it becomes to make th e p ictu re.
His program first works out 
the general outlines.
MAHL'S SIMPLEX METHOD
Calculate all intersections of sighting ray 
with objects in scene; calculate which 
is nearer; shade it according to angle.

It seem s, how ever, that M ahl's w ork may 
only be a rediscovery of whal one organization 
w orked out e a rlie r and is being secretive about.
A firm delightfully called MAGI (Mathematical 
Applications G roup, In c .) of Elmsford, N .Y ., 
has extended the same idea more elaborately.
They happened into the halftone game through 
a m ilitary contract.
MAGI's system , now thoroughly developed 
un d er R obert G oldstein, began in 1965 in a study 
of radiation hazards in  battlefield equipm ent.
They wrote a program  to simulate paths of radia- 
tion, sa y , that might reach a lank d riv e r under 
varous disagreeable circum stances. Having 
w ritten a program  thal would ascertain the su s­
ceptibility to radiation of battlefield m achinery, • 
they noted that the same program  could be 
adapted to m aking photographs. The progam 
sim ulated radiation; light is radiation; ipso 
facto, p ictu res. Substantially the same program  
would make photograph-like im ages, by treating 
the objects as opaque, and reflecting different 
shades according to color and angle of view .
The resu ltin g  system  makes nice pictures 
of objects composed of planes and q uadric s u r ­
faces; and includes, as will be seen from the 
racin g  c a r and ch air, colored surface d esig n s, 
shadow s and spectral reflections. Nol only does 
MAGI's softw are for this process produce deli­
cately shaded pictures; if the virtual pictu re- 
plane is moved until it intersects the subject, 
it produces a cross-section.
MAGI ru n s this program  remotely in 
Fortran on a big com puter-- but they have their 
own minicom puter setup for photographing the 
results as color m ovies. They now offer use of 
Ihis system  commercially for m aking movies or 
s tills .HAGI p r o g ra m  w as o r i g i n a l l y  d e v e lo p e d

ROUNDUP
These have been some of the highlights 
of the halftone game to date. T he methods des­
cribed so far are mainly softw are-oriented, and 
for the most part work most efficiently as pro­
gram s. In the ne*t article we will look at some 
outlandish new forms of equipm ent, u n d er con­
struction o r proposed, for dedicated production 
of 3-D' halftone pictures.

PRA'S W ORLD-VIBW
Roger Boyell. of Pennsylvania Research 
Associates, Philadelphia, likes to refer lo (he 
company's main Interest m i "modelling Ihe phys­
ical world." Thus he and his associates have 
developed systerna for cartography, landscape 
modelling, pipe design, and simulation of com­
plex radar sysiems.
A radar simulator Ihey are putting to­
gether for the Navy will show Ihe results of any 
possible radar system moving over any poaaible 
terrain. A pilot or navigator trainee, In a slm- 
mulaied cockpit, will aee the mission's changing 
radar picture aa he changes tha plane’s course 
or the radar's tuning. The radar picture, ap­
pearing on a screen and changing In real time, 
will look Just the way ths radar would look en 
a real mission-- Qylng In perspective among 
mountains or valleys, high or low. at any bear­
ing and speed, and viewed through any type of
radar.
Boyell's approach la to treat each compo­
nent of the pictorial/radar simulation as a 
separate problem, lo be handled In different 
ways, and blended In a final buffer, a core 
memory which la read out to television. Seps- 
rate mechanisms supply components of shsdow,  
specular reflection.  coloration and randomizing 
effects. The core buffer continuously refreshes 
the scanned CRT dlaplay.
Boyell has put Ihe same techniques lo 
work making simulated halfione pictures of the 
moon (eee cut). Both the radar and moon sys­
tems use Ihe same type of halftone Image synthe­
sis, even though superficially they aeem quite 
different. But radar Is radiation, juat like light, 
and Boyell'a techniques of three-dimensional 
modelling and aearch apply equally well to de­
pletion by reflected visible light— I.e., half­

I don't expect you to believe this, because 
nol even my patent attorney does, bul Ihe system 
I call Pantasm Is Intended to make pictures that 
paaa the Turing-leal: you won't be able to tell 
them from real photographs. Pantasm la Inten­
ded to allow the user to make realistic, Hierony­
mus Bosch-like photographs snd movies, with 
real-looking people (and scenery. Imaginary 
characters, monsters, etc.) In scenes of arbi­
trary complexity. It la expected lhat 1675 eco­
nomics will make Its construction feasible.
Fantasm I  originally conceived as a method 
of making realistic photographs and movies, not 
knowing at the time thal this was Impossible, 
but feeling ll could be done aimehow If the 
problem were broken down sufficiently. At 
times 1 1 was not clear which of us would be 
broken down flrat. 1  or U.
II occurred lo me sometime In 1960-1 lhal 
computer-interpolated. Disney-type cartooning 
methods would be feaalble. After some thought 
I realized lhat pseudo-photography would be 
poaaible, and dropped the cartooning Idea. The 
strange behavior of people whom I told aboul 
this led me to increasing secrecy.
The general goal waa to make a system 
thal could do realistic movies without scenery 
or actora, and make pictures indistinguishable 
from real photo graphs of real scenery and 
actors. ("Whal do you mean, Indistinguishable 
from photographs?” people keep asking. What 
do thay mean what do I mean?) The surfaces 
are to be pul In by "sculptors," animated by 
"puppeteers," and photographed by a "director." 
The objective Is for moviemaking to be under 
ihe utter Imaginative control of Ihe creative user.

Systems of Computer Image Corporation.
SO FAR W E HAVE SUMMARIZED AND DISTINGUISHED AMONG 
THE MAJOR TECHNIQUES FOR COMPUTER SYNTHESIS OF IMAGES 
FROM DIGITALLY STORED REPRESENTATIONS OF SCENES.
W E  NOW  TAKE THE WRAPS FROM A DIFFERENT BUT RELATED 
SET OF TECHNIQUES— THE SYSTEMS OF 
COMPUTER IMAGE CORPORATION .
Lee Harrison III got Die Idee for what la  
now Computer Image Corporation In 1959. Al­
ready having an art degree, he went on for a 
degree in electrical engineering, end through  
long lean years put together the technical basics  
around which Cl's system s are now built. Com­
puter Image Corporation la now a going concern,  
and output from their ayatems. especially Scan-  
imate, la now widely visib le on television.CAESAR System . C h a r a c te r !  are

Compuier Image Corporation seems lo be  
the first Arm to be commercially successful In  
the halftone field. Whether they should be  
Included with the others Is arguable, however,  
Their ayatems are nol widely understood, and  
the relation of these syatems to the Other system s  
and programs described In these articles Is  
problematical.  Among the Tew who understand  
their techniques, some argue that they do not  
syntheslte images al all, bul ralhar twist pre­
existing pictures with a sort of Moog synthesiser,  
and that their analog techniques are really Just  
compound oscillators rather than true computing.
I  think that this view Is wrong, at leaat as  
regards Ihelr moat ambitious system, and that  
Cl'a techniques deserve review. All the world  
la not digital. Cl system s do Dll up areas with  
grey-seals (and other) pictures, end their sy s­
tems Involve three-dimensional coordinates,  
occultaikm and coloration; thus I think ll ap­
propriate lo discuaa them here.
The following discuss Ton Is tha first, I  
believe, to lift the vail ol secrecy thal haa hith­
erto confounded oh servers of this company's  
work. In the Ught of the extreme sophistication  
with which they have pursued extremely strange  
techniques, they should benefit from the wider  
understanding. (Note lhal this material, which  
haa been assembled from various sources and  
careful TV watching, Is partly conjectural.)
Computer Image's system s represenl an  
apparently unpromising approach brilliantly  
followed through.
AU of Cl's systems are a strange combin­
ation of closed-circuit TV and analog components 
oul of a music synthesizer: oscillators, poten­
tiometers .  interconnection n el works ,  The baaj c 
mechanisms are the same for all, bul they are 
carried to different logical extremes, with dif­
fering accoutrements, in the four systems.
They all seem lo be based on ihe extraordinary 
Anlmac II, nol yel Implemented; it would seem 
lhal for business reasons lhe company decided 
lo raise money promoting simpler systems, so 
lls bread and butler now consists of two less 
ambitious aystems, Scanlmale and Anlmac I; 
both of which might be puzzling if nol recog­
nised aa parts of a more elegant whole- It 
would seem they were designed backwards as 
spinoffs from Anlmac II, as waa CAESAR, their 
more recent 2-D ay stem.
The extraordinary ramifications and  
varieties of this system , with all Its electronic  
add-on and composite methods, stagger the most  
jaded technical ImaginaUon.
At Uie heart of tha C( system s Is the prin­
ciple of filling areas of a CRT screen with an  
oscillating trace. Thia Is a principle common  
to both Llssajous figures and television; but  
Compuier Image haa elaborated ft peculiarly.
By variations they paint twlated television Images,  
wiggle eectiona of superimposed draw ings, create  
moving filigree effects, and hope to animate  
whole groups of opaque electronic puppets In  
3-apace.
Consider an oscillating trace on an oscillo­
scope. This la a two-dimensional oscillation,  
having two signals, x  and y . Bul a three-dim­
ensional oscillation is also possible; any third  
signal, z , can be Interpreted as a third dimen-  
alon, meaning that a "point of light" is whirling  
out some pattern In a three-dimensional space—  
an osdllotank, so to speak. Let us call this  
point moving In three dimensions a "space trace."
Now to view thla trace we need to cul It  
down to two dimensions. By ignoring one of  
the traces we can view the osdllotank in certain  
fixed waya; but by cresting a "view calculator,”  
a box performing certain perspective transfor­
mations on the three signals of lha space trace,  
we may obtain a view of the osdllotank from a  
movable vantage point. This is an E-y view  
which we may pul on an ordinary osdlloscope.
Let us now add one more signal, b (for  
brightness). This Is the brightness Bignal fam­
iliar In television:
Brightness of the spot Is thus independent  
of the movement of the space trace. For example,  
the apace trace could describe s helical path, a  
sort of tornado motion, and we could time Its  
spinning to phase with a TV slgn sl. If we now  
brighten the space trace only with the bright­
ness signal of a TV pickup, w e now will see  
On our view of the osclliotank) what would look  
like a TV picture curled around itself in space.
The different Cl system s are bulll around  
this effect.
Output from all these signals Is ordinarily  
picked up by another v id lcon, which stabilizes  
it by converting it Into conventional televisionWHi£uif6- oMiVettt Sf C£M“ urei( Cs*pof<TM *i.

x / ,A  last Cl technique, technically minor bul 
remarkable in effect, permits this blocking and 
shadowing among separate objects. This Is the 
use or a storage CRT tube on which every frame 
Is painted (from the viewpoint or from the Ught 
Source). The picture is palmed on the Stonge 
CHT,  nearest things first; and the return atgnal 
from the screen tells whether the space trace is 
crossing an area already painted during the 
frame. The tube's output signal then effectively 
constitutes a silhouette. Thla d u e  indicates that 
the apace trace should nol be visible; and hence 
is uaed to cul off brightness while the trace la 
within the already-filled area. This gates 
between two desired objects or pictures, fore­
ground and background. If operaled from Ihe 
point of view of the lig h t.  ll gates shadow: the 
signal Is used to control the relative brightness 
of the shadowed and unshadowed features of a 
puppet In 3-Space.
A  fascinating variety of embellishments 
has been put into these system s by Cl's ingen­
ious engineers. Coloration of the final video 
signal Is added by gating color levels under 
control of the brightness sig n al, permitting pic­
tures with several grey-levels to be transformed 
10 up lo four rainbow h u e s.  Separate shapes 
described by the space Irsce may be indepen­
dently moved and Jointed at the same time: 
Harrison pointedly calls such separate shspes 
"bones." Darkening at ihe backside of a spun 
shape, o r brightening at edges of a painted por­
tion, and brightening in proportion lo curl, are 
all strange capabilities of Ihls machine, Lip- 
synchronized mouthlike motion can be imparted 
to any part of the shape spun by the space trace 
(whether or nol a mouth is palnled on It), by sn 
audio detector feeding direcily to the circuitry 
from a live mike. And the limbs of Cl’s ghostly 
figures can be made to sw ing by connection of 
sensors to the animators themselves— in a living 
pantograph,
SCANIMATE is a popular device now widely 
used (at Cl's studios) for the making of TV com­
mercials and stalion-break emblems. This Is 
iheir simplest system, used for the conversion 
and discombobulaiion of Hat artwork. In Scani- 
mate, the space trace is controlled by hand- 
operated potentiometers. Two separate oscillator 
settings are available, so that the space trace 
csn have two separate oscillation patterns, 
spinning oul two entirely different virtual shapea 
in 3-space. A  hsnd-throtllc eases from one 
oscillator setting lo the olher. This permits an 
image to be moved, shrunk o r enlarged, or 
flipped: to go from w hirling around lo a sort of 
hula; and many more effects. The picture 
painted on it may be sc«n to roll on invisible 
spindles, bloom into fountains, or undulate aa 
pennants-- all by modulating lhe brightness of 
the flying spol as it traces its unseen shape.
This shape. In turn, can move between its two 
forms under control of the Ihrottle.
Animac I (usually called Anlmac) provides 
greaier flexibility In controlling Ihe apace trace. 
The system's oscillations are controlled by an 
input vidioon. which artists may quickly modify 
with pastel cheek at ihe pickup. Ghostly lobu­
lar lettering, swarming pendulum-pattems and 
jiggling tlllgTeea are among the possible doodlea.
CAESAR, their newest system, is oriented 
toward Yogi Bear-iypc animation. The artist's 
cartoons are automatically superimposed on a 
background o r each other. They may be moved, 
and made to wiggle under real-time control by 
the user.
But It 1 b lo Anlmac II lhat Ihese curiosities 
lead. What Harrison calls the "Snow White 
Capability" of Animac II will permit the sculpture 
of full humanoid puppets, with perhaps thirty 
articulated "bones," opaque to one another and 
casting shadowa, colored, moving and talking.

WHAT ABOUT REAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL 
DISPLAY?
In science-fiction stories you hear about 
how objects are made to appear as if they’re 
standing in the middle of the room. For instance, 
1  believe lhal in Heinlein’s S tranger in a Strange 
Land they watched a "tank" in which things 
a p p e ared .
Well, a lot of people have thought about 
th is, and it's not so easy as you might think.
One interesting scheme used a sort of 
translucent propellor, spinning rather fast, on 
which com puter-generated images were p ro ­
jected from below. It waa done by the dotting 
method, so that a brig h t dot of light would ap­
p ea r high or low in space depending on whe­
ther it was projected on a relatively high o r low 
point on the propellor.
G O ltfG- H K J t h
\ c j r j
This was interesting but had numerous 
disadvantages-- not the least of which was the 
danger of the thing flying apart. (Translucent 
materials lend not to be as strong a s , s a y , 
m etal.) Another basic problem , though, was 
the fact that any given point in the space could 
only be displayed at a given tim e, when the 
propellor’s height in that region was just right, 
and thal meant that at that given instant you 
couldn’t display any of the other points that 
could only be displayed at that instant. A con­
siderable disadvantage.
Probably the most astonishing 3D display 
is Sutherland's Incredible Helmet. T his consists 
of a helmet with two dinky CRTs mounted on it, 
each being driven in real time by a perspective 
system (such as the LDS-1) and set up with 
prism s to the w earer's eyes. Through the prism s 
the w earer can eee the real world in front of him. 
Reflected in the prism s, how ever, and thus mixed 
into the view of the real w orld, is the glowing 
wire-frame being presented to him— in p erspec­
tive, and with its separate views m erging into 
an apparent object in front of him. But he need 
not stand still: as he moves, the helmet's chan­
ging position is monitored by the program , and 
the display system changes the views accordingly 
meaning he can walk around and through a dis­
played object. T he illusion, and the possibilities, 
are fantastic: imaginary architecture, explanations 
and diagrams of things in the room, poetry that 
changes as you walk through it, . . .  w ell, you 
w ork on it. Not available commercially.T here was a lot to be said for tents. They 
could be made by tailors, rather than construc­
tion gangs; they could be transported and stored 
flat. T heir surface-to-volume ratios couldn't be 
beat.
Noting this, an architect named Ron Resch 
said to himself: what about making large-scale 
foldable structures, likeunto geodesic domes, 
that cou_id be simply manufactured in sheet 
form and creased at the factory, then bolted and 
cabled and strutted in the field?
Re6ch has now for years been experi­
menting with complex folded structures.
T h e re's only one trouble. If you've 
messed wilh paper airplanes you know that 
folding is an inaccurate process, and so the 
prospect of discovering complex geometric struc­
tures by the hand-folding of paper is rather 
slim.
Recognizing this, Resch has contrived to 
work at a computer disp lay . His w ork— the 
search for great folding structures— is one of 
the first practical uses of halftone polygon 
computer graphics. He is, naturally, at the 
University of Utah.Lou Katz, of N Y U , put old-faflhioned ete reo p - 
ticons up to the CRT, and displayed two separate 
viewe to the two eyes. Works fin e , even with 
isom etric display.
Bob Spinrad of Xerox Data Systems has a 
patent on displaying 3D from a com puter through 
an ordinary color TV. A ssum ing y ou're using 
some standard way of re freshing the TV— des­
cribed elsew here-- the image for one eye is d is­
played in gTeen, the other in r e d , and you look 
through red and fcreen g la sse s. The w onders of 
m odem  science. Spinrad chuckles over It him­
self.
Another scheme glued silv er Mylar to the 
front of a loudspeaker, then played a soft hum 
through the loudspeaker lo pulse the Mylar back 
and forth. Then you used thst as a m irror to 
look at what was going on the CRT-- which was 
showing a lot of points at odd places that would 
appear to be in space. Unfortunately thia was 
hard to coordinate, and, like the propellor# 
often required you to put dots in several places 
at once, which don't w ork.
For a while you could get— maybe you 
still can— a three-dimensional computer output 
device. Here’s what it did: it created objects 
showing data structures that had three variables.
(It didn’t make wire-fram e objects o r the lik e.) 
Automatically ejecting w ire through a styrofoam 
block, and snipping the done ones, it created 
little mountains showing three-dim ensional data. 
Very cute. Since many people have problems 
with mountainous computer data, it probably 
should have caught on.
Then a lot of people mumble the word 
"holography,” as if that is going to settle some­
thing. While holograms are terrific and rem ark­
able. and have been produced on com puters, 
making them is not a process that can be carried 
out decendy on sequential machines— let alone 
making them in real time. So if a solution to 
interactive three-dimensional com puter display 
is going to come through holography, it means 
a whole new batch of technology will have to be 
invented.
My friend Andrew J . S inger, who comes 
and goes in the computer field and is one of 
the five o r six smartest people 1 ever met, says 
he knows how to build a display tank, and I  
believe him. He explained it quickly to me once 
and I  asked him to tell it ag a in , but he just said 
sadly, "What's the u se-- there are eo many 
great things that could be d o n e..."
FOUR DIMENSIONS, EGAD
So much for three dimensions. Now, some 
readers are bound to ask, "What about four dim ­
ensions?" because they are science-fiction fans 
or troublemakers o r mathematicians o r som ething.
Just as we can make a two-dimensional 
picture of a three-dimensional object, it is pos­
sible, dear reader, to make a two-dimensional 
picture of a four-dimensional object.
What ia a four-dimensional object?
Why, any object that has four dim ensions, 
(thanks a lot, you say), or even four m easurable 
qualities, such as height, weight, age and g rade 
point average. Well, let’s not get into that, b u t 
it turns out that views of Buch multidimensional 
structures may be obtained by the same homogen­
eous matrix technique^ already mentioned for 
regular perspective calculations. Rule of thumb: 
however many dimensions your data has o rig in ally , 
you add one more dimension, homogeneous with 
the rest, and there exist formulas (sorry. I d on’t 
have them) for view calculation.
(Note, of course, that while a tw o-dim en­
sional view ia a picture, a three-dimensional 
view is a three-dimensional object-- you'll have 
to view it on an interactive 3D compuier display 
of some kind.)

Let’s say that on the screen of Tom's 
system we are viewing an animated bird, 
flapping its wings. Since it's being shown 
on a three-dimensional refreshed line display 
(see pp..Virt“Xl>*\) 0)  , it appears only as white 
lines on a dark screen.From v id e o ta p e  j  
" The Number C ru n c h e rt  
by TDF &  DJS.
From the Image Processor, the finished 
signal goes out to videotape recorders.
What then have we overall? One of the 
world's most flexible facilities for the 
rapid production of educational videotapes.The Circle Graphics Habitat, however, 
is something else again. It results from 
two intricate, independent technological 
developments, each an intricate system care­
fully crafted by an exceptionally talented 
person, coming together like two hands clap- 
ing. Like ham and eggs, like man and woman, 
Sandin's Image Processor and DeFanti's GRASS 
language conjoin directly and interact per­
fectly as if they had been made for each 
other, which they were not.
Dan merely points a TV camera at Tom's 
screen, and runs the TV signal into his Im­
age Processor. Now, in the Image Processor, 
he gives it the magic of color. Different 
colors, interplaying with gradations and 
subtlety.From v id e o ta p e 3 
" The S p ir a l Tape>"  
by DJS and TDF.
To explain something, you create a 
three-dimensional stick-figure "model" of it, 
using DeFanti's GRASS language. Then you 
make a videotape of it, showing rotations or 
other manipulations, using the Image Proces­
sor to give it color.
DeFanti and Sandin have spent much of 
the academic year '73-4 getting the kinks out 
of this procedure. (Many of the difficulties 
stem from the unreliability of videotape re­
corders.) Stills from some of the first work 
are shown here.

especially complicated technical things. 
Usually it takes infinite reconsiderations, 
finagling, modification, intertwingling.

Uneducated people typically think of 
education as the learning of a lot of facts 
and skills. While facts and skills certainly 
have their merits, "higher education" is also 
largely concerned with tying ideas together, 
and especially alternative structures of such 
tying-together: with showing you the vast un­
certainties of things.
A wonderful Japanese film of the fifties 
was called Rasho-Mon. It depicted a specific 
event-- a rape-- as told by five different 
people. As the audience watches the five se­
parate stories, they must try to judge what 
really happened.
The Rasho-Mon Principle: everything is 
like that. The complete truth about soaething 
is never known.
Nobody tells the complete truth, though 
some try. Nobody knows the complete truth.
Nowhere may we find printed the complete truth. 
There are only different views, assertions, 
supposed facts that support one view or another 
but are disputed by disbelievers in the particu­
lar views; and so on. There are "agreed-on 
facts," but their meaning is often in doubt.
The great compromise of the western world 
is that we go by the rule: assume that we never 
know the final truth about anything. There are 
continuing Issues, Mysteries, Continuing Dia­
logues. What about flying saucers, "why Rome 
fell," was there a Passover Plot, and Did Roose­
velt know Pearl Harbor would be attacked?
Outsiders find the intellectual world pom­
pous, vague in its undecided issues, stuffy in 
its quotes and citations. But in a way these 
are the sounds of battle. The clash of theories 
is what many find exhilarating about the intel­
lectual world. The Scholarly Arena is simply 
a Circus Maximus in which these battles are sche­
duled.
Many people think "science" is free from 
all this. These are people who do not know much 
about science. More and more is scientifically 
known, true; but it is repeatedly discovered that 
some scientific "knowledge" is untrue, and this 
problem is built into the system. The important 
thing about science is not that everything will 
be known, or that everything unanimously believ­
ed by scientists is necessarily true, but that 
science contains a system for seeking untruth 
and purging it.
This is the great tradition of western 
civilization. The Western World is, in an 
important sense, a continuing dialogue among 
people who have thought different things. 
"Scholarship" is the tradition of trying to 
improve, collate and resolve uncertainties.
The fundamental ground rules are that no issue 
is ever closed, no interconnection is impossible. 
It all comes down to what is written, because 
the thoughts and minds themselves, of course, do 
not last. (The apparatus of citation and foot­
note are simply a combination of hat-tipping, 
go-look-if-you-don’t-believe-me, and you-might- 
want-to-read-this-yourself.)
"Knowledge," then-- and indeed most of our 
civilization and what remains of those previous-- 
is a vasty cross-tangle of ideas and evidential 
materials, not a pyramid of truth. So that pre­
serving its structure, and improving its accessi­
bility, is important to us all.

The idea of branching movies is quite exciting.
The possibility of it is another thing entirely.
The only system I know of that worked was at the 
1967 Montreal World's Fair (Expo 67). At the Czech 
Pavilion—  you will recall that before the crackdown 
they had quite a yeasty culture going in Czechoslovakia—  
there were some terrific fantic systems going. One was 
a wall of cubes with slide projectors inside (that roll­
ed toward you and back as they changed their pictures).
And then the Movie.
The Czechoslovakian Branching Movie—  I forget its 
real name-- had the audience vote on what was to happen 
next at a number of different junctures. What should 
she do now, what will he do next. etc. And lo and behold! 
after they had voted, the lights vent down, and that's 
what would happen next. People agreed that this gave 
the movie a special immediacy.
I never saw the movie-- I waited in line several 
hours but the line was too long to get into the last show­
ing. So instead I went backstage and talked to Radusz Cin- 
cera, who worked out the systen. It turns out that it 
didn't work quite the way people supposed. A lot of people 
thought that "all the possibilities" had been filmed in ad­
vance. Actually, there were always only two possibilities, 
and no matter what the audience had chosen, somehow the film 
wa6 plotted to come down to the same next choice anyway:
In the actual setup, they simply had two projectors 
running side by side, with Film A and Film B, and the 
projectionist would drop an opaque slide in front of 
whichever wasn't chosen. But Cincera said that aud­
iences almost always chose the same alternatives anyway, 
so half the movie was hardly ever used...
In the early sixties a movie was making the rounds 
in which audiences were supposedly allowed to vote on the 
ending— •  "Hr. Sardonicus,” I believe it was called. From 
the ads it seemed that audiences would be polled as to 
which last reel to show. Whether the villain was to get 
his comeuppance, or whatever.
Then there was that Panacolor cartridge projector, 
mentioned elsewhere, which would have allowed choices by 
the user
More recently there's the CMX system, also mentioned 
elsewhere. This is a setup, being jointly marketed by 
CBS and Memorex, for computer-controlled movie editing.
But actually it could also be used as a branching movie sy­
stem. Essentially the movie itself is stored frame-by- 
frame (ae video) on big disks, made by Memorexi and, under 
computer control, the output can be switched rapidly among 
the frames, effectively showing the stored movies. (To my 
knowledge, the video networks haven't yet recognized Uie 
possibilities of this.)
The only trouble is, it’s extremely expensive (half a 
million?), it has an exact storage capacity limited by the 
number of disk tracks (presumably one track per frame)—  
perhaps five minutes total one one big unit, but you can 
buy more-- and it can only give its full performance to 
one viewer at a time.) (Or ts fke_l*ve-)
It may be that the irost practical branching movie 
system would be a cartridge movie viewer and a big stack of 
cartridges. When you make your choice, change the cart­
ridge. But of course that's not as much fun as having it 
happen automatically.R E A L IT Y  IS O B S O L E T E
The Idea that objective reality is perceived by our senses, 
is an obsolete concept. Old truisms like “seeing is believing-, 
become m uch less believable as w e become more aware that, the 
biological machinery of life Itself, transforms images of the 
pnysical world before w e are made conscious of them. These 
oiological mechanisms share m any sim ilarities in principle and 
n application, to other mechanisms observed in the natural 
environment and those Invented for our ow n use. Since w e are 
becoming more aware of the nature of perception and tbose 
mechanisms involved, now  is the time to gain control'of our­
selves and share more discretion In the operatfw rof our ow n 
Biological machinery. W e  have entered the age of hyper-reality.
Day-to-day living provides only a limited variety of 
physical stimulus, and li tt l e  incentive to manipulate the 
physiological and psychological processing involved. Han's 
historical preoccupation with the need to maintain constant 
images of the physical world, is a product of his extreme 
orientation toward physical survival In a hostile environment.
The current evolving society of leisure orientations removes 
this need for constant images and thereby enhances the opportunities 
for a more complete use of the sensory apparatus and those re­
lated brain functions. M any have turned to drugs or meditation.
M ore specifically It Is proposed here, that modern cormunlcations 
technology be employed as a “vehicle of departure" from this need 
for constant images, to bring about a more complete use of the 
hum an technology its e lf. Hyper-reality is the employment of 
technology other than the biological machinery, when used to 
affect the performance of the biological machinery beyond its 
o w n limitations. This is almost like making adjustments on a 
television set, except you are what's plugged 1n, and the con­
trols are outside your body, being part of whatever technology 
Is Interfaced to the body itself. A s part of such a man- 
machine interface you could extend your ow n mental processes, 
or if you should choose, you could just diddle with the dials. 
Hyper-reality is an opportunity to enhance the various qualities 
of the hum an experience. Reality is obsolete.

TYPES OF HYPERTEXT
Let’s assume that you have a high-power 
display-- and storage displays won1t do, be­
cause you have to see things move in order 
to understand where they come from and what 
they mean. (Especially text.) So it has to 
be a refreshed CRT.
Basic or chunk style hypertext offers 
choices, eTther as f ootnote-markeTs (like 
asterisks) or labels at the end of a chunk. 
Whatever you point at then cwtnes to the screen.
Collateral hypertext means compound an­
no tarTons-oFyaraiTel-text (see p.J^yt-).
Stretchtext changes continuously. This 
requires very unusual techniques (see p-_5*2_l? ) »  
but exemplifies how "continuous” hypertext might 
work.
Ideally, chunk and continuous and collateral 
hypertext could all be combined (and in turn col­
laterally linked; see "Thinkertoys," p.J^S^-)*
A "fresh" or "specific" hypertext-- I don't 
have a better term at the moment-- would consist 
of material especially written for some purpose. 
An anthological hypertext, however, would consist 
of materials brought together from all over, like 
an anthological book.
A grand hypertext,  then, folks, would be 
a hypertext consisting of "everything" written 
about a subject, or vaguely relevant to it, 
tied together by editors (and NOT by "prog­
rammers," dammit), in which you may read in 
all the directions you wish to pursue. TKere 
can be alternative pathways Tor people who 
think different ways. People who have to 
have one thing explained to them at a time-- 
many have insisted to me that this is normal, 
although I contend that it is a pathological 
condition-- may have that; others, learning 
like true human beings, may gather and sift im­
pressions until the ideas become clear.
And then, of course, you see the real 
dream.
The real dream is for "everything" to be 
in the hypertext.
.Everything you read, you read from the 
screen (and can always get back to right away) ;  
everything you write, you write at the screen 
(and can cross-link to whatever you read; see 
Canons, p. b^lfl ).
Paper moulders. Microfilm is inconvenient.
In the best libraries it takes at least min-'  
utes to get a particular thing. But as to 
linking them together-- footnoting Aeschylus 
with Marcus Aurelius, linking genetic data' 
to 15th-century accounts of Indian tribes-- 
well, you can only do it on paper by writing 
something new that ties them together. Isn’t 
that ridiculous? When you could do it all 
electronically in seconds?
Now that we have all these wonderful de­
vices, it should be the goal of society to put 
them in the service of truth and learning.
And this is the way I propose. Not through 
obscure forms of "information retrieval;" not 
through newly oppressive forms of "computer- 
assisted instruction;" and not through a pur­
ported science of "artifical intelligence" 
that will create new personalisms to irk us.
All these obstructive oddities, I think, have 
developed as separate ideals because of the 
grand preposterosity of Professionalism that 
has created a world-wide cult of mutual incom­
prehensibility and disconnected special goals.
Now we need to get everybody together again.
We want to go back to the roots of our civil­
ization-- the ability, which we once had, for 
everybody who could read to be able to read 
everything. We must once again become a com­
munity of common access to a shared heritage.
This was of course what Vannevar flush 
said in 1945 (see , in an article every­
body cites but nobody reads.
The hypertext solution in many ways ob­
viates some of these other approaches, and in 
addition retains and puts back together the 
great traditions of literature and scholarship, 
traditions based on the fact that dividing 
things up arbitrarily just generally doesn't 
work.
EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED.
(The only way in which my views differ 
with those of Engelbart and Pask, I think is 
in the matter of structure and hierarchy.
Both men generally assume that whatever 
natural hierarchy may exist in particular 
subjects needs to be accentuated; I hold that 
all structures must be treated as totally ar­
bitrary, and any hierarchies we find are inter­
esting accidents.)CAN IT BE DONE?
I dunno,
Licklider, one of computerdom’s Great Men, 
estimated in 1965 that to handle all text by 
computer, and bring it out to screens, would 
cost no more than what we pay for all text 
handling now. (But of course there is the 
problem of what to do with the people whose 
lives are built around paper; that can’t be 
taken up here.)
The people who make big computers say 
that to get the big disk storage to hold great 
amounts of text, you have to get their biggest 
computers. Which is a laugh and a half. One 
IBM-style computer person pompously told me 
that for large-scale text handling the only 
appropriate machine was an IBM 360/67 (a shame­
fully large computer). fSuch people seem not 
to understand about minicomputers or the po­
tential of minicomputer networks-- using, of 
course, big disks.
There are of course questions of relia­
bility, of "big brother" (see Canons, p. ), 
and so on. But I think these, matters can be 
handled.
The key is that people will pay for it.
I am sure that if we can bring the cost down 
to two dollars an hour-- one for the local 
machine (more than a "terminal"), one for the 
material (including storage, transmission and 
copyrights)-- there’s a big, big market. (And 
that's what the Xanadu network is about; see 
p. DM57.) My assumption is that the way to do 
this is not through big business (since all 
these corporations can see is other corpora­
tions); not through government (hypertext is 
not committee-oriented, but individualistic-- 
and grants can only be gotten through sesqui­
pedalian and obfuscatory pompizzazz); but 
through the byways of the private enterprise 
system. I think the same spirit that gave us 
McDonald's and kandy kolor hot rod accessories 
may pull us through here. (See Xanadu Network,
p- >\S7-)
Obviously, putting man's entire heritage 
into a hypertext is going to take awhile. But 
it can and should be done.

Hypertext at last offers the possibility  
of representing and exploring it all  
without carving it up destructively.
Arthur C. Clarke wrote a book entitled 
The Lost Worlds of 2001 (Signet, 1972), 
about the variants and alternatives of’  
that story that did not find their way 
to the screen.
In a hypertext version, we could look 
at them all in context, in collateral 
views, and see the related variants-- 
with annotations.

GLINDA'S HAG 1C BOOK
GTlnda the Good, gentle sorceress of the 
southern quadrant of the land of 0z—  not the 
flaphead portrayed by Billie Burke In the 
Goldwynlzed film—  has a Magic Book tn which 
Everything That Happens Is written.
The question, of course, Is how It's 
chosen.
You can only watch news tickers for a 
short time before getting very bored.Mortimer J. Adler, the •■■an who reduced all of 
Western Culture to a few Great Books plus an Index 
under his own categories, has now Addled the 
Encyclopedia Brltannica.
Since 1965 be has been creating Brltannlca 3, 
the venturesome and innovative new version, nowon 
sale for about half a thou.
Bri tannlca ^ Is basically a 3“level hypertext, 
made to fit on printed pages by the strictures of 
Adler's editing (according to Newsweek,  some 200 
authors withdrew their work rather than submit to 
the kind of restrictions he was Imposing).
The Idea may be basically good, even though 
the sesqulpaedallan titles may Impaed the raeder.
THE BURNING BUSH
In fact hypertexts were foreseen very 
clearly in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, Roosevelt’s 
science advisor. When the war was in the bag, 
he published a little article on various groovy 
things that had become possible by that time.
"As We May Think" (Atlantic Monthly,  July, 
1945) is most notable for its clear description 
of various hypertext techniques-- that is, link­
ages between documents which may be brought rap­
idly to the screen according to their linkages. 
(So what if he thought they'd be on microfilm.)
How characteristic of Professionalism. 
Bush's article has been taken as the starting 
point for the field of Information Retrieval 
(see p. )f but its actual contents have been 
ignored by acclamation. Information Retrieval 
folk have mostly done very different things, yet 
thought they were in the tradition.
Now people are "rediscovering" the article. 
If there's another edition of this book I hope 
I can run it in entirety.

Douglas Engelbart is a saintly man at 
Stanford Research Institute whose dream has 
been to make people smarter and bring them 
together. His system, on which millions of 
dollars have been spent, is a wonder and a 
glory.
He began as an engineer of CRTs (aee 
"Lightning in a Bottle," p.DM6); but his 
driving thought was, quite correctly, that 
these remarkable objects could be used to 
expand man's mind and Improve each shining 
hour.
Doug Engelbart’s vision has never been 
restricted to narrow technical issues. From 
the beginning his concern was not merely to 
plank people down at display consoles, but 
ln the most profound sense to expand man's 
mind. "The Augmentation of Human Intellect," 
he calls it, by which he means making minds 
work better by giving them better tools to 
work with.
An obvious example is writing: before 
people could write things down, men could 
only learn what they experienced or were 
told by others ln person; writing changed 
all that. Within the computer-screen fra­
ternity, the next step is obvious; screens 
can double and redouble our Intellectual 
capacities. But this is not obvious to every­
body. Engelbart, patiently instructing those 
outside, came up with a beautiful example.
To show what he meant by the Augmentation of 
Intellect, Engelbart tied a pencil to a_ brick.  
Then he actually made someone write with It. 
The result, which was of course dreadful, En­
gelbart solemnly put into a published report. 
Not yet being able to demonstrate the aug­
mentation of Intellect, since he had as yet 
no system to show off, he had masterfully de­
monstrated the disaugmentation of intellect: 
what happens if you make man's tool9 for work­
ing out his thoughts worse instead of better. 
As this poor guy was with his brlckifled pen­
cil, explained Engelbart, so are we all among 
our bothersome*inflexible systems of paper.
Starting small, Engelbart programmed up 
a small version of what most fans call "The 
Engelbart System" some ten years ago. One 
version has it that when it came to looking 
for grants, management thought he acted too 
kooky, and so assigned a Front Man to make 
the presentation. But, as the story goe6, 
the man from ARPA (see "Military...", p. 
pointed at Engelbart and said, "We want to 
back him."
A small but dedicated group at SRI haa 
built up a system from scratch. First they 
used little CDC 1700 minicomputers; then, 
various grants later, they were able to set 
up their own PDP-10, in which the system now 
resides, and from which it reaches out ac­
ross the country.
Doug calls his system NLS, or "oN-Line 
System." Basically it is a highly responsive, 
deeply-structured text system, feeding out to 
display terminals. From a terminal you may 
read anything you or others have written, and 
write with as-yet-unmatched flexibility.
The display terminals are all over. The 
project has gone national, though at great ex­
pense: through the ARPA net of computers, you 
can in principle become a user of NLS for 
something like $50,000 a year.THE "KNOWLEDGE WORKSHOP”
For a lucky fifty or so people, Engelbart's 
system is Home. Wherever they are—  at Stan­
ford Research Institute or far away on the 
ARPAnet-—  a whole world of secretarial and 
communication services is at their fingertips. 
The user has but to call up through his dis­
play terminal and log on. At that point all 
his written files, and numerous files shared 
among the users, are at his fingertips. He 
may read, write, annotate the cross-link. 
(Engelbart's system has provision for col­
lateral structuring: see "Thinkertoys," [X*r2_.) 
He may send messages to others in the Workshop. 
He may open certain of his files to other 
people, and read those that have been opened 
to him.
This all has a certain vagueness if you 
do not understand how bound you are today by 
paper—  the problems of finding it, sorting 
it, looking things up. (If you write, that 
Is, write a lot, you know all too veil how 
Intractable is paper, what a damned nuisance.) 
With a system like Engelbert's, now, whatever 
is written i6 Instantly there.  Whatever you 
want to look up is Instantly there, simultan­
eously Interconnected to everything else it 
should be connected to—  source materials, 
footnotes, comments and so on. A document is 
completed the moment it is written; no human 
being has to retype it. (It need not be typed 
on paper at all, if it's just for the workshop 
members: a printout is only needed if it has 
to go to someone outside tbe system.)
In many ways, Engelbart's system is a pro­
totype for the world of the future, I hope.
ALL HANDLING OF PAPER IS ELIMINATED. Whatever 
you write, you write on the screens with key­
board and pointer. (No more backs of envelopes, 
yellow pads, file cards, typewriters.) What­
ever you transmit to fellow users of the system 
you simply 'release'—  no physical paper changes 
hands.
The group has also worked out some remark­
able techniques for collaborative endeavor.
Two people—  say, one ln California and one in 
New York—  can work together through their 
screens, plus a phone link; it's as if they 
were side-by-side at a magic table. Each sees 
on his screen whst the other sees; each controls 
a moving dot (or "cursor") that shows where he's 
pointing. The effect Is somewhere between a 
blackboard and a desk; both may call up docu­
ments, point things out in them, change them, 
and anything else two people might do when work­
ing on something together.Basically the system is a large-scale setup 
for the storage, bringing forth, viewing and 
revision of documents and connections among them.
The documents are Btored (of course) in 
alphabetical codes. Connections among them, 
or other relations within them, are signalled 
by the presence of other codes within them; 
these are ordinarily not displayed, however, 
except as directed by a particular display 
program and display programs can of course 
vary.
There are various programs for display, 
ln large part depending on what sort of 
screen system the individual user has.
(NLS is used with everything from hlgh-reso- 
lutlon line-drawing screens converted to 1000- 
llne television, down to inexpensive Delta 
Data terminals—  a brand, incidentally, that 
allows text motion, which most don't^ Engel­
bart's system is extremely general, allowing 
the creation of files having all kinds of 
structures, and display programs in all kinds 
of styles. (I hope that this side of the pre­
sent book conveys a sense of how mahy styles 
that can be.) However, most users are devoted 
to certain standardized styles of working that 
have been well worked out and permit the easy 
sharing of material and of operating practices. 
Here, for instance, is standard screen layout:
Two separate panels of text appear, and links 
may be shown on them. (Thus it's a thinkertoy-—  
see p. .) Two little windows at the top re­
mind you of what you're seeing and what you're 
asking for. We can't get into the rest of it 
here
THE COMMAND LANGUAGE
NLS has a comnand language which all 
users must learn. While It Is a stream­
lined and straightforward coimnand language, 
nevertheless It requires the user to type 
in a specific sequence of alphabetical 
characters every time he wants something 
done. (This Is acceptable to computer- 
oriented people; 1 suspect It would not 
be satisfactory, say, for philosophers 
and novelists. For designs oriented to 
such users, see JOT (p ? * 5 t>  ) and Carmody’s 
System, nearby. Parallel Textface (p?*93) 
and Th3 (p.VtfV).)
Incidentally, NLS users may also employ 
a cute little keyboard, something like a 
kalimba, that allows you to type with one 
hand.  You simply type the six significant 
ASCII bits (see chart p. % jg) ln one "chooP
—  it sounds hard but is easy to learn.
Sample conmands: I (insert), D (delete),
M (move or rearrange). Then you point with 
the mouse.
MOUSE?
The Engelbart Folks have built a pointing 
device, for telling the system where you're 
pointing on the screen, that is considerably 
faster and handler than a lightpen. (Unfor­
tunately, I don't believe it's conanerdaily 
available.) It's called The Mouse.
The Engelbart Mouse is a little box with 
hidden wheels underneath and a cable to the 
terainal. As you roll It, the wheel's turns 
are signalled to the computer and the comput­
er moves the cursor on the screen. It's faat 
and accurate, and In fact beats a lightpen 
hands down in working speed.
Through the comnand language, NLS allows 
users to create programa that respond ln all 
sorts of ways; thua tbe fact that certain text- 
handling styles are atandard (as in above il­
lustration of screen layout) results more from 
tradition than necessity.E n g e l b a r t  m e e t s  u i t n  b

I will npw try to describe Pask's work 
as he has explained it to me. Perhaps this 
will be of some help to those who may have 
been mystified or dumfounded by contact with 
this fabulous man.
Gordon Pask’s concern is abstraction and 
how concepts are formed, whether in a creature 
of nature or a robot or a computer program. 
Abstraction is of interest primordially (as life 
evolved thinking capacity), psychogenetically 
(as the mind acquires new facilities, described 
most peculiarly by Piaget), and epistemological- 
ly (how do we know? Like, how do we know, man?), 
and methodologically (how can we most effectively 
find out Diore?) .
ilis interest, then, is in teaching by 
allowing students to discover exact relations 
in a specific subject matter by the very pro­
cess of abstraction that is of so much interest.r fh a t he d o e s , t h e n ,  i s  p r e p a r e  g iv e n  
f i e l d s  o f  l e a r n i n g  s o  t h a t  th e y  c a n  b e  s t u d i e d  
by s t u d e n t s  u s in g  a b s t r a c t i v e ,  m e th o d s , w ith o u t 
g u id a n c e .
This preparation basically has two steps. 
First he sets up the whole field. This is 
done in collaboration with a "subject matter 
expert," who names the important topics in 
the field and states what interconnections 
they have. The result is a complex graph 
Structure (see p. jj, ) which Pask calls a 
conversational domain.  It comes out to huge 
diagrams of labels and lines between them.
Then Pask processes this structure to 
make a more usable map of the field that he 
calls an entailment structure. The processing 
basically involves removing "cycles'* in the 
graph, thus making the structure hierarchical 
in a slightly artificial way justified by what 
the subject-matter-expert has said is the 
structure of the field.
(This processing is carried out by a pro­
gram called EXTEND.)
The resulting Entailment Structure is 
then presented to the student as a great map 
of the field which he may explore.
Pask intends that the student's explor­
ations, will consist of testing analogies, or 
what Pask calls morphisms, to find the exact 
structures of knowledge he is supposed to 
be acquiring. This knowledge will be in the 
Form of isomorphisms. or exact analogies, i.e. 
laws .
Pask’s overall system, examples of which 
he has running in his laboratory in England, 
he calls CASTE (Course Assembly Systea and 
Tutorial Environment). A further development, 
which is to be put on a PDP-11/45 computer 
(see p. Tt  and p. Mi. ) at the Brooklyn Chil­
dren’s Museum, is called THOUGIIT-STICKER.
This program is intended to allow the demon­
stration and testing of analogies directly, 
by children.
PASK AND HYPERTEXT
Gordon Pask’s work is remarkably similar 
to my own stuff on hypertext.
Essentially Pask is reducing a field to 
an extremely formal structure of relations
which nay then be studied by the student, at 
the student's initiative.
(What I don't quite understand is how the 
analogies are to be explored and tested.)
Anyway, a principal point is that the 
student is in control and may use his initia­
tive dynamically; the subject is not artifi­
cially processed into a presentational se­
quence. Moreover, the arbitrary interconnec­
tions of the subject, which are no respecters,  
of the printed page, are recognized as the 
fundamental structures the student must deal 
with and come to understand. On all these 
points Pask and 1 are in total agreement..
Indeed, his explorable systems-- (I don't 
know if they will be what I elsewhere call 
h y p e T g ra m s or re s p o n d in g  resources)-* will be 
f a s c i n a t i n g ,  fun and t e r r i f i c a l l y  e d u c a t i o n a l .  
Because he is.
Now it turns out that this exactly com­
plements the notion of hypertext as I have been 
promulgating it lo these many years.
Hypertent is non-sequential text. If we 
write a hypertext on something, it will be 
most appropriate iF~we give it the general 
interconnective structure of the field. In 
other words, the interconnective structures 
chosen for the textual parts are likely to have 
the same connective structure (in general) as 
Pask's Entailment Structure.
For another kind of hypertext, the antho- 
logical hypertext built up of lots of other 
writings, it is also reasonable to expect the 
connective structures to cluster to the same 
general form as Pask's entailment structure.
In other words, the very same field of 
knowledge Pask is out to represent as an ex- 
plorable,  formalized whole, I am out to repre­
sent as an explotable informalized whole, with 
anecdotes, jokes, cartoons, “enrichment mater­
ials,” and anything else people might dig.
In still other words, let’s have both 
and call it a party.

T IL E  FRENCH HAVE A W O R D  FOR IT
In French they use the term V Informatique 
to mean, approximately, the presentation of in­
formation to people by automatic equipment.
Unfortunately the English equivalent, 
informatics, has been preempted. There is a 
computer programming firm called Informatics, 
Inc., and when I wrote them about this in tjj6.  
early sixties they said they did not want their 
name to become a generic term. Trademark law 
supports them in this to a certain extent. 
(Others, like Wally Feurzeig, want that to be 
the word regardless.) But in the meantime 
I offer up the term fantics,  which is more 
general anyhow.M EDIA

Slaply thle: till now the structures of tudla somehow 
sprang naturally from the nature of things. Now they don't 
anymore. Radio, books and movies have a natural Inner dy­
namic of their own, leading co aueh constructs. While 
this may prove to be eo for coaputer aadl« as wall (— as 1 
argued In "Getting It Out of Our Systen," cited p.fatf), 
Chen again it aay not. In other words, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT WE ARE INVENT IMG PRESENTATIONAL TECHNIQUES IN THE NEW 
MEDIA, not merely transporting or transposing particular 
things Into thea because they eeen right. The psychologi­
cal constructs of man-machine systems may turn out to ba 
largely arbitrary. Thus bringing co terainal systoas con­
ventions like dialogue instruction ("CAI"), or arblcrary 
restrictions of how things nay be connected, presented or 
written on the coaputer aay be a great alstake.
The hlghway-nuaber analogy continues.  The older 
highways had nuabere for convenience, and our travels be- 
caae organized around them, and particular highways (like 
"U.S. 1" and "Route 66") caae to have special character.
BuC now with che Interstates, a highway le a planned. 
sealed unlc, no longer Juet a collection of roads gather­
ed togecher under a name.
This unit, Che Interstate, Is not merely a psychologi­
cal construct, but a planned structure. Knowing whaC works 
and what doesn't In che design of fast highways, Che Inter- 
scacas were built for speed, strucCured ae closed unlcs. 
Designing Chem wlch llalced access hss been a conscious 
decision ln the syscea design for well-based ressons, not 
a chance scruccure brought in froa horse-and buggy days.
Now, the conscructs of previous media—  writing, fllas, 
othar arts—  evolved over tine, and In many cases aay have 
found their way to a "natural" form. BuC because of the 
peculiar way that coaputer media are currently evolving 
(— under large grants largely granted to professionals who 
uee very large words to proaoce the idea that their origi­
nal professions are largely applicable—  ), this sort of 
natural evolution aay noC take place. The new constructs 
of coapuCer media, especially coaputer screen-e«dl^ aay not 
have a chance Co be choughc out. We need designs for screen 
presenCstlons and thslr mixture—  vignetting, Windows, 
screen ttsalcs, transformed and augaented views, and the 
rapid and comprehensible control of theae views and windows. 
We sre still Just beginning to find clever viewing tech­
niques, and have hardly begun to discover highly respon­
sive forma of viewsblllty and control (cf. collaCeratlon 
ln "Thlnkertoys," p. $*52^, snd Knowlcon’s button-box
(See T. Nelson, "A Conceptual Framework for 
Han-Machine Everything," cited p. , and material on 
controls, below.)
THE HIND'S UNIFICATION
One of the reasrkable things abouC the huaan mind 
la che way it ties things togecher. Perceptual unity 
comes out of nowhere. A bunch of irregular reel*- 
dentlal and industrial blocks becomes thought of as "ay 
neighborhood." K most remarkable case of mental uni­
fication Is afforded by the visage of our good friend 
Hickey Mouse. The character is drawn ln a most para­
doxical fashion: Cwo globelike protrusions (representing 
the sars) are ln different positions on the head, depend­
ing on whether we view him from che front or the side.
No one finds this objectionable; few people even notice, 
it seems.

What this shows, of course, le che way the alnd can 
unify Into a consistent mental whole even things which 
are inconsistent by normal rules (ln chls case, the rules 
of three-dimensional structure).
Even perceptlone are subject to the same principle 
of unification. The fingernail is an excrescence with no 
nerves ln lc; yet somehow you csn feel things with your 
fingernails—  eying togecher disparate sensadons inco 
a unified senea of soaechlng ln the world (ssy, a coin 
you’re crying to pick up). In Che ssme way, an experienc­
ed driver feels the rosd: ln a very real sense, che car's 
wheels aod suspension become his own sensory extensions.
This principle of oencal unification is what aakea 
chlngs cooe together, both literally and figuratively, 
ln a fantlc field. A viewer sees two consecutive movie 
shots of streecs snd unifies chem into one screet; controls, 
If you sre used co chem, become a single fused syscem of 
options; we csn have a sense of a greater whole, of which 
one view on a screen Is a pare.

CONTROLS: THEIR UNIFICATION AND FEEL
Controls sre Intimately related to screen presencs- 
don, jusc ae arbitrary, and just ae luporcant.
The artful deaign of control systems le a deeply 
Misunderstood area, ln no way deconfused by calling it 
"human factors." There are aany functions to be control­
led, such as text editing operations, views of Che uni­
verse on s screen, the heading of a vehicle, the tile of 
an aircraft, the windage and adjustments of artillery,
Che temperature of a etove burner and any ocher control­
lable devicee. And nowadays any conceivable devices 
could control that—  pushbuccons, knobs, cranks, wheels, 
levers and Joysticks, trigger, dials, aaglc wands, aani- 
puladon by llghtpen on CRT screens (see p. 9*'T), flicks 
of Che finger, the turning of che eves (as in soae ex­
perimental gun-alalng devicee), Che huaan voice (but 
thac inCroduces probleas—  see p.^HI3), keyboards, elec­
tronic cablete, bgelbart alee and chordwrlters, and so(lateral)
Ho I ling  
Relative  
to CameraThe human mind being ae supple as it Is, anything 
whatever can be used co control systeas. The problem le 
having It be a comprehensible whole.
Aa slresdy remarked, our ability mentally co unify 
things Is excrsordlnary. That we somehow tie together 
clutch, gear, acceleracor and brake InCo a comprehensible 
concrol etructure to make care go and stop should amaze 
and inetruct.
Engineers and "human factors" people speak aa though 
there were some kind of scientific or determinate way to 
deaign control systams. Piffle. We choose a sec of con­
trols, much like an artlet’e Palette, on the baeis of ge­
neral approprlateneae; and Chen Cry besc and mosc artistic­
ally to fit thea to what needs doing.
The resulc muse be conceptually elear and reCroacdve- 
ly "obvious"—  simply because clarity is che simplest way 
co keep the ueer from making mistakes. Clear snd simple 
systems are easier co learn, harder to forget, lass likely 
to be screwed up by the user, and thus are more economic­
al—  getting more done for Che resources put ln.
There Is a sore of paradox here. The kinds of con­
trols are totally arblcrary, buC Chelr unification In a 
good syscea is not. Sooochness snd clarity can cooe from 
disparate elements. Ic is for chls resaon that I lay par­
ticular strees on ay JOT system for che Input and revision 
of texC, using a palette of keys available on che simplest 
standard computer terainal, the 33 Teletype. I cannot 
aake the final judgement on how good this systea Is, but 
it pleases me. JOT 1s also an important example becauee 
lc suggests that a conceptually unified syscem can be 
creaced from Che arcful non-obvlous combination of loose 
elements originally having differenc intended purposes.
Mentsl analogy 1s an important and clear concrol 
technique. We tend co forget chat the steering wheel was 
invenCed. aeparacely replacing both the boat's tiller and 
the automobile's Ciller. We aleo forget thac Che use of 
such steering mechanisms must be actually learned by 
children. Such continuous analogies, though, require cor­
responding continuities in che spscs co be controlled—  
an important condiClon.
Simplicity and clarity have nothing to do with the 
appearance of controls, buC wlch the clarity and unique 
locatablllty of individual parte. For thia reaaon I find 
deplorable che arrayed controls thac are turning up, e.g. 
on Codsy's audio equipment. Designers aeem to think 
rowa of things are desirable. On che contrary: Che best 
designed controls I ever used are on che Sony TC-50 
pocket tap^ recorder,  t a u i.rej)
I  r i 'F t f V  I

but of courae cbls Is now phased out; Instead mosc cassette 
recorders have five or six stupid buttons ln a row. (Was 
lc too good to last?)
Spurious control elegance comes ln many guises. Con­
sider Bruce McCall's description of the Tap-A-Toe Futuroi- 
die Foodess De-Clutchlngtu systeo. This wae offered on 
the fictltloua 1934 Bulgemoblles, and allowed you to drive 
the car wlch one pedal, racher than three (see box nearby).
Careless and horrible designs are noc all flccltloua. 
One egregious exaaple also Indicates the low level of de­
aign currently going Inco some responding systems: comput­
er people hsve designed CRT writing systeas for newepspers 
which actually have a "kill" button on the console, by 
which authors would accidentally kill their stories. In 
s recenc magazine article It wae explained thac che event­
ual aoluclon wae Co chsnge Che prograa so thac to kill 
the atory you had co hit the "kill" button {wice. To ae 
this seems like a beautiful exaaple of what happens when 
you lec lnsulaced technical people design che system for 
you: s "kill" button on the keybosrd is about as intelli­
gent ae instslllng knives on the dashboard of a car, 
pointing ac che passenger.
There is another poor tendency. When computer pro- 
granere or other Cechnlcal people design particular 
sysceas wlchout thinking more generally, Chlngs are not 
likely to be either simple or coablnable. What aay re­
sult la intricate user-level controls for one particular 
funcdon, controls chac sre differendy used for anocher 
particular function, making the two functions not com- 
binable.But useful wholeneas can be helped along. Jusc as 
what I have called che accordance-*tructure of wrltine 
(see *Writlng,' p.^ft) aoves It along aooothlv fanM- 
deelgn that builds from a well-organized internal dy­
namic should confer on a fantlc system the same momentum 
and clarlCy chac carefully-organized writing haa.
This contribution of wholeness can only occur, how­
ever, lf cbe under-level coapllcatlons of a system have 
been carefully streamlined aod emoothed back ac least 
as they affect the user. Consider ehe design of the JOT
editing syscea (p **>); while it is simple co the 
us£T, cooputer people often react co it with Indignation 
and anger becauee It hides whac are co chem the signifi­
cant features of computer text editing—  explicit pre- 
occupadon wlch storage, especially the calling and re­
vision of blocks." Nevertheless, I ssy It la the de­
tails at Chls level which muse be smooched back if we 
are co make systems for regular people.
The same applies to the Th3 system (see p. DfrfO, 
which Is designed to keep the user clear-minded aa he 
coopsres Chlngs in multiple dimensions. The oechanlsms 
st the computer level muse be hidden to -nVf chls work.
FANTIC SPACE
Pudovkln and Elaeneteln, greac Russian movle-makars 
of che tvenelee, talked abouc "filaic space"—  ths Imagin­
ary apace that che action ae*"1" to be ln.
Thl* concept extends Itself naturally co fantlc space 
the space and relatlonehlpe sensed by a viewer of sny me- '  
dlum, or a user in any presenting or responding environ­
ment. The design of computer display ayatema, then la 
really che artful crafting of fandc apace. Technicalities 
are subservient to effects. (Indeed, I think computer 
graphics is really a branch of movle-oaklng.)
FANTIC STRUCTURE
The fantlc structure of anything, then, consists of 
les noticeable pares, lneerconnectlona, contents and ef­
fects.
I claim that It 1s the fantlc unity—  the conceptual 
and presentational clarity of theee chlngs—  thsc makes 
fantlc systems—  presentational systems and materiel- 
clear and helpful, or not.

Whac makes for the best control structures, then? 
There Is no simple answer.  I would ssy provlslonslly 
chac ic is a maccer of unified and conspicuous constructs 
in che menCsl view of Che domain to be controlled, 
correapondlng to a vell-dletingulshed and clesrly-incer- 
related set of controlling mechanisms. But that is hardly 
che last word on che subject.
THE ORGANIZATION OF WHOLENESS
Ic should be plsin that ln responding screen- 
systeas, "what happens on the screen" snd how che 
controls respond" sre noc really distinguishable.
Ths screen evenes are pare of the way the controls 
respond. The screen functions and control functions 
aerge psychologically.
Now, there le a crap here. Just ae the gas 
pedal, clutch, gesrshifc and brake aerge peychologi- 
cslly, any control structure csn aerge psychologicsl- 
ly. Clutch snd gear shift do not have, for aosc of us, 
clear psychologicsl relevance Co the problea of con­
trolled forward motion. Yet we psychologlcslly Inte­
grate tha use of Chese mechanisms as a unified means 
for controlling forward ootlon (or, like the author, 
get an Automatic). In much the saae way, sny syscem 
of conCrols can gradually coae Chrough use co hsve s 
psychological organlzadon, even spuriously. The crap 
is thac we so easily lose sight of srbltrariness snd 
even stupidity of design, and live with It when it 
could be so auch better, becauee of chls psychological 
melding.Now regardless of whecher chls Is a well-thougtfrout 
way to divide up a subject—  I’ll be interested to see 
how it works out—  chese controls do not sea eo be well- 
arranged for conceptual claricy. It seems eo be Che old 
rowe-of-buttons approach.
I have no doubt thac ehe people working on chis sy- 
seem are certain this is Che only possible layouC. But 
consider chae the student's options might be clearer to 
him, for Instance, lf we set It up aa follows:
OB


--- Page 123 ---

Or like this:
What I am crying co show here le that merely Che 
arrangement of buttons creates different fantlc con­
structs. If you see this, you will recognise that 
considering all the other options we have, designing 
new media le no small matter. The control structures 
merge mentally with the presentational structures.
The tempCadon to settle on ahort-slghtsd designs hav­
ing ehallow unity le all coo greac.
FANT1C DESIGN
Fantlc design is basically Che planning and selec­
tion of effects. (We could also call chese "performance 
values"—  cf. "production values" In movlea.)
Some of these lncended effects are singly the com­
munication of information or cognitive structure—  "in­
formation transfer," Co use one of the more obtuse 
phrases current. Other desirable effects Include orien­
ting the user and often moving him emotionally, including 
sometimes overwhelming or entrancing him.
In che design of fantlc eysCeme involving automatic 
response, we have a vast choice among Cypee of presenta­
tional technlquee, tricks that are Just now becoming 
understood. Not Just sereen techniques snd functions, 
but aleo reeponee technlquee and functions.
(If "feelle" systems are ever perfected, ae In 
Huxley'e Brave New World, it's still the same In prin­
ciple. See WacHapteas, p. h*\^-)
In both general areas, chough—  wlchin media, and 
designing media—  it seems to me that the creation of 
organizing constructs is the most profound problem.
In particular, the organizing constructs must not dis­
tract, or Cear up contents. An analogy: In writing, the 
inventions of the paragraph, chapter and footnote were 
inventions in writing technique that helped clarify what 
was being expressed. What we need In computer-based 
fantlc design ie Inventions which do not artificially 
chop up, constrain, or interfere with the subject (see 
box, Procrustes, nearby).
I do not feel these principles are everywhere suf­
ficiently appreciaced. For Instance, the built-in 
structures of PLATO (see "Faniic Space of PLATO," p.
P*^7.T) disturbs me somewhat in its arbitrariness-- and 
the way Its control keys are scsttered around.
But there is always something artificial—  that is, 
some form of artifice—  in presenCadon. So the problem 
1s to devise techniques which have elucidating value but 
do not cut connections or ties or other relationships 
you want to save. (For this reason I suggest the reader 
consider "Stretchtext," p. J>h|a|  , collateral linkage 
(p a,*d the various hypergrams (p •  j)^i
These structures, while somewhat arbitrary and artifi­
cial, nevertheless can be used to handle a subject 
gently.)
An important kind of organizing construct is the 
map or overall orlendng diagram. This, too, is often 
partly "exacc" and partly "artifice:" certain aspects of 
the diagram may have unclear import but clear and help­
ful connotation. (For lnscance, consider Che "picture 
systems" diagram on p. DM£o —  Jusc what does che 
vertical dimension mean? Yes, but whac does it really
Responding systems now make it possible for such 
orienting structures to be multidimensional and respon­
ding (cf. the orienting function of che "dimensional 
flip" control llluscrated on p. DM JJI )•
Fantic design, Chen, Is the creation either of 
things to be shown (writing, movie-making, etc.) at the 
lower end, or media to show things In, or environments.
1. The design of things co be shown—  whether 
writing, movie-making, or whatever—  Is nearly always a 
combination of some kind of explicit structure—  an ex­
planation or planned lesson, or plot of a novel—  and 
a feeling thae the author can control in varying degrees. 
The two are .deeply intertwined, however.
The author (designer, director, ecc.) muec chink 
carefully abouc how to give organization co what le 
being preaented. Thia, eoo, hae both aspeccs, cognition 
and feelings.
Ac the cognitive end, the author must concern him­
self with detailed exposition or argument, or, in fiction, 
plot. But almply putting appropriate parte together is 
not enough: the author must use organizing eonscruccsco 
continually orient the reader's (or viewer's) mind. Re­
peated reference to main concepts, repeated shots (in a 
movie) of particular locations, serve this function; but 
each medium presents its own possible devices for thlB 
purpose.
The organization of the feelings of the work 
criss-crosses the cognitive; but we can't get Into 
it here.Selection of points and parts contributes to both 
a*Pects. I* you are trying to keep the feeling of a 
c w g  from being ponderous, you ean never include 
everything you wanted, but mist select from among the 
explicit points and feellng’fenerators that you have 
thought of.
2. The design of media themaelvea, or of media 
subsystems. Is not usually a matter of option. Books, 
movies, radio and TV are given. But on occasion, as 
for world's fairs or very personal projects, we have
® certain option. Which allows things like:
Smellavislon or whacever they called It:
movlea with a smell-track, which went out 
Into the theater through odor generatora.
Branching movies (see p.^H^).
"Multi-media" (multiple audio tracks and al- 
multaueoue elide projectlone on different 
screens).
Stereo movlea.
And ao on. The thing about the onea mentioned Is that 
they are not viable aa continuing setups for repeated 
productions. They do not offer a permanent wide market; 
they are not stable; they do not catch on. Which Is in 
a way, of course, too bad.
But the great change la Juat abouC now. Currenc 
technicalities allow branching iredls—  especially those 
associated with computer screens. And It Is up to us now 
to design them.
3. MB4TAL ENVIRONMENTS are working places for struc­
tured activity. The saae principles of showmanship apply 
to a working environment as to both the contents of media 
and the design of media. If media are environments into 
which packaged materials are brought, structured environ- 
mencs are baalcally environments where you use non-packag- 
ed material, or create things yourself. They might also 
be called "contentlesa media." The princlplea of whole- 
neee In structured environments are the same aa for the 
others, and many of our examples refer to them.
The branching computer acreen, together with the 
aelfsame computer's ability to turn anything elae on 
and off as selected by the user, snd to fetch up in- 
formation, ylelde a realm of option In the design of 
media and environment that bee never existed before.
Medls we design for screen-bssed computer systems are 
going to catch on widely, so we must be far more at­
tentive to the options that exlat in order to coomlt—  
nationally, perhaps—  to the best.
In tomorrow's systems, properly unified controls 
can give us new flexibilities. If deeply well-designed, 
these promise magnificent new capabilities. For In­
stance, we could allow a Musician to "conduct" the per­
formance of hia work by a computer-based music eyntheele 
system (see "Audio," p.^il), perhapa controlling the 
many qualities of the performance on a ecreen ae he goee, 
by means of such techniques aa dimensional flip (see 
p.£n7j). (The tradition of cumulative audio aynthesls, 
as practiced In the flftlea by Lee Paul and Mary Ford, 
and more recently by Walter Carlos and Mike Oldfield, 
will take on a new fillip as multidimensional control 
techniques become coimiion.)One of the intents of this book haa been to orient 
you to some of the possibilities and soae of tbe option** 
considered generally. There le not room, unfortunately* 
to discuss more than one or two overall possibilities In 
detail. The moat successful such systaa so far haa been 
PLATO (discussed pp. DM18-19); others

NEW MEDIA TO LAST
Whet's worse, we are confronted not merely vltb che 
job of using computers to present epeclflc things. The 
greater cask Is co design overall computer media that 
will last us into a more intelligent future. Adrift In 
a aea of Ignorance and confusion, it is nevertheless our 
duty to try to create a whole transportation systa that 
everybody can climb aboard. For the long run, fantlc 
ayatems oust be trested not as custom systaa for explicit 
purposee, but ae OVERALL GENERAL DESIGNS WHICH VILL HAVE 
TO TIE TOGETHER AND CATCH CM, otherwise collapse and 
perlab.
FINAL CONSEQUENCES.
It aeema to me certain thet we ace w i n g  coward 
a generalized and universal Fantlc syeta; people can 
and ahould doand it. Perhaps there will be several; 
but if so, being able to tie them together for m o t b  
transmission is essential. (Think of what It would be 
like If there were two kinds of telephones?) Thle then 
Is a great search and crusade: to put together truly 
generel media for^ruture, systoas at which we can read* 
writs, learn and visualize, year after Tear after year. 
The Initiatives are not likely to come from the more 
conventional eoaputer people; some of them are part of 
the probla. (Be prepared for every poealbla form of 
aggressive defensiveness froa prograMere, especially: 
"Why would you want that?" The correct answer la 
BECAUSE, damlt!)
But thle all means thst Interior coaputer technical­
ities have to be SUBSERVIENT, and the prograoers cannot 
be allowed to dictate bow it la to behave on tbe basis 
of the underlevel structures that are convenient to thea. 
Quite the contrary: from the fullest consideration of che 
rlehest upper-level structures we want, we tha usera-to- 
be aust dictate what lower-level structures are to be 
prepared within.
But this means you, dear reader, muat develop the 
fantlc imagination. You auat learn to visualize possible 
uses of computer screens, so you can get on down to the 
deeper level of how we are going to tie theee things 
together.
The deelgner of responding coaputer eyeteas le 
cresting unified setups for viewing snd msnlpulstlng 
things—  and the feellnga, Impreeelons end sense of things 
thst go with them. Our goal should be nothing less than 
REPRESENTING THE TRUE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF HUMAN 
THOUGHT. (Yes, Dream Machlnee Indeed.) But it should 
be eomethlng more: enabling the mind to weigh; pursue, 
synthesize snd evaluate ideas for a better tomorrow.
Or for any at all.

First of all, 1 feel that very few 
people understand what interactive computer 
s/stems are about. It's like the story of the 
blind men and the elephant-- each thinks it's 
a different thing (based, usually, on his own 
technical specialty).
But I think it's all show business.
PENNY ARCADES are the nodel for interactive 
computer systems, not classrooas or libraries 
or imaginary robot playaates. And coaputer 
graphics is an intricate branch of aovie- 
naking.
Okay, so I wanted a term that would 
connote, in the most general sense, the show- 
aanship of ideas and feelings-- whether or not 
handled by aaehine.
I derive "fantics" from the Creek words 
"phainein" (show) and its derivative "phantas- 
tein" (present to the eye or aind).
You will of course recognize its cousins 
fantastic, fantasy, phantoa.  ("Phantom” aeans 
what is shown; in medical illustration it refers 
to an opaque object drawn as transparent; a 
"phantom limb" is an amputee's temporary feeling 
that the severed limb has been restored.) And a 
fantast is a dreamer.
The word "fantics" would thus include 
the showing of anything (and thus writing 
and theater), which is more or less what I 
intended. The term is also intended to 
coveT the tactics of conveying ideas and 
impressions, especially with showmanship 
and presentational techniques, organizing 
constructs, and fundamental structures 
underlying presentational systens.
Thus Engelbart's data hierarchy (P.,*<fc-7), 
SKETCHPAD'S Constraints (p.,**>), and PLATO’S 
fantic spaces (pjK 2("7*  8re fantic constructions 
that need to be understood if we are to under­
stand these systens and their potential usages.
Livermore Labs, those hydrogen-bomb 
design people, will have a "Laboratory for 
Data A nalysis,” an opulent faculty for ex­
perim enting with multidimensional visualisation.

The beat w ith Ihe w o n t. 
Everything la deeply Ininrtwingled.
Designing screen systems that focus 
the user's thought on his work, with help­
ful visualizations and no distractions, is 
the great task of fantic design.
In a system I designed for CRT motion- 
picture editing, the user could aaipulate 
written descriptions on the screen (corres­
ponding to the usual yellow-pad notes). To 
see the consequences of a particular splice, 
for instance, the editor would only have to 
draw a line between two annotated lines re­
presenting shots. Trim variations could be 
seen by moving this cut-line (illustrated).
Not long after, CBS and Memorex did'in­
troduce a system for movie-editing by CRT-- 
but I've heard that in their systea the user 
has to actually deal with numbers. If so, 
this is missing the whole point.

Our greatest problems involve thinking and the 
visualization of complexity.
By "Thinkertoy" I mean, first of all, a system 
to help people think. ('Toy' means it should be easy 
and fun to use.) This is the same general idea for 
which Engelbaxt, for instance/ uses the term "aug­
mentation of intellect.”
But a Thinkertoy is something quite specific:
I define it as a computer display system that helps 
you envision complex alternatives.
The process of envisioning ccsnplex alternatives 
is by no means the only important form of human 
thought! but it is essential to making decisions, de­
signing, planning, writing, weighing alternate theor­
ies, considering alternate forms of legislation, doing 
scholarly research, and so on. It is also complicated 
enough that, in solving it, we may solve simpler prob­
lems as well.
We will stress here some of the uses of these sy­
stems for handling text, partly because I think these 
are rather interesting, and partly because the com­
plexity and subtlety of this problem has got to be 
better understood: the written word is nothing lees 
than the tracks left by the mind, and so we are really 
talking about screen systems for handling ideas, in 
all their complexity.
Numerous types of complex things have to be inter­
compared, and their relatione inter-cemprehended. Here 
are a few of the many types:
Alternative
Discrepancies among the testimony of witness)
' V
Successive drafts of the same document.
Pairs of things which have sane parts the 
same, some parts different (contracts, holy books, 
statutes of different states, draft versions of 
legislation...) i
Different theories and their ties to parti­
cular examples and evidences.
Under examination these different types of inter- 
cooparison seem to be rather different. Now, one ap­
proach would be to create a different data structure 
and viewing technique for each different type of complex.  
There may be reasons for doing that in the future.
For the present, however, it makes sense to try to 
find the most general possible viewing technique: one 
that will allow complex intercanparisons of all the 
types mentioned, and any others we might run across.
One such technique is what 1 now call collatera- 
tion, or the linking of materials into collateral struc­
tures.* as will be explained. This is fairly straight­
forward if you think enough about the problem; Engel- 
bart discovered it independently.
Let us call two structures collateral if there are 
links between them, connecting a selected part of one 
with a selected part of the other. The sequences of 
the connected parts may be different. For sin^licity’e 
sake, suppose each one is a short piece of writing.
(We will also aspume that there is some convenient form 
of rapid viewing and following between one end of a link 
and another.)Now, it will be noted first off that this ie an ex­
tremely general method. By collateral structuring we 
can easily handle the equivalents of: tables of contents! 
indexes,- contents and marginalia; explanations, exegesis, 
explication? labeling? headings: footnotes; notes by the 
writer to himself; contents and questions by the reader 
for later reference; and additional details out of se­
quence -
alii&£S£i»S. .then. i. the cre.tior, of „ch 
multiple and viewable links BETWEEN ANY TWO DATA 
STRUCTURES, in principle, it i, general and powerful 
enough to handle a greet variety oj poe.ible ueee in 
hunan intellectual endeavor, and deeenree conaider- 
able attention from researchers of every stripe.**
The problem then, is how to handle this for 
rapid and convenient viewing and whatever other work 
the user wants to do—  writing and splicing, inter- 
comparing, annotating and so on. Two solutions ap­
pear on this spread: The Parallel Textface*®, design­
ed as a seminal part of the Xanadu system (see p.>jft), 
which I hope will be marketed with that system in the 
near future, and a more recent design which I've work­
ed on at the University of Illinois, the 3D Thinkertoy 
or Th3.
CLARITY AMD POWER
We stressed on the other side of the book that 
conputer systems must be clear, single and easy to use. 
Where things like business uses of computers are con­
cerned, which are intrinsically so single in principle, 
some of the complications that people have been forced 
to deal with in i 1 1-designed computer systems verge on 
the criminal. (But sane computer people want others 
to think that's the way it has to be. "Your first 
duty is to keep your job, right?" one computer person 
said to me recently. "It wouldn't do to set up systems 
so easy to use that the company wouldn't need you any­
more." See “Cybercrud," p. 6.)
But if it is desirable that conputer systems for 
simple-minded purposes be easy to use, it is absolutely 
necessary that computer systems for complicated purposes 
be simple to use. If you an wrangling over complex al­
ternatives—  say, in chess, or in a political simula­
tion game (see "Simulation,” p. %£ ), or in the throes 
of trying to write a novel, the last thing you will tole­
rate ie for your conputer screen to Introduce complica­
tions of its cwn. If a system for thinking doesn't 
make thinking simpler—  allowing you to see farther and 
more deeply—  it is uselss, to use only the polite term.
But systems can be both powerful and sinple at 
the same time. The myth that things have to be com­
plicated to do anything for you is pernicious rubbish. 
Well-designed systems can make our mental tasks lighter 
and our achievements come faster.It is for this reason that I contend„the reader 
these two designs of mine: as examples of user-level 
control and viewing designs—  fantlc environments , if 
you will (see p^)s-tt)-- that are pruned and tuned to 
give the user great control over the viewing and cross- 
consideration of intricate alternatives, without e x ­
plication. I like to believe that both of these, in­
deed, are ten-minute gya*— '■—  that is, when we get 
them running, the fange of uses shown here can be taught 
to naive users?in ten minutes or less.
It is because of my heartfelt belief in thia kind 
of simplicity that I stress the creation of prefabrica­
ted environments, carefully tuned for easy use, rather 
than the ereation of ccmputer languages which m u t  be 
learnt by the user, as do such people as Bngelbart (aee 
p.^16) and DeFanti (see p.J)N3i). Now, their approach 
hbviously has considerable merit for sophisticated users 
who want to tinker repeatedly with variant approaches.
Por people who want to work Incessantly in an environ­
ment, and on other things—  say writers—  and are ab- 
eent-minded and clumsy and nervous and forgetful (like 
the present author), then the safe, prefabricated en­
vironment, with thoroughly fail-safe functions and ut­
terly memorable structural and control interrelation­
ships, is the only approach.
* In my 1965 paper (see bibliography) I called collateral 
structures zippered lists.
** a group at Brown University has reportedly worked 
along these lines sinee I worked with them, but due 
to certain personal animosities I hava not kept up 
with their developKnts. It will be interesting to 
see what kind of response they ean get out of the 
IBM systems they are using.

From Co 1 er_id_^e 1 s Poems? A Facsimile 
Reproduction of the Proofs 
and MSS, of some of the Poems.  
(Folerof t, 19 72.)It has been recognized fron the davn of computer display that the 
grandest and most important use of the conputer display should be to 
aid decisions end creative thought. Hie work of Ivan Sutherland (SKETCHPAD) 
and Douglas i.'npelbart have really shown how ve may use the display to 
visualize and effect our creative decisions swiftly and vividly.
For sone reason, however, the most important aspect of such systems 
has been ncglected. We do not make important decisions, we should not 
make delicate decisions, serially and irreversibly. Rather, the power of 
the conputer display (and its conputing end filing support) must be so 
crafted that ve may develop alternatives, spin out their complications 
and Interrelationships, and visualize these upon a screen.
No systen could do this for us automatically. What design and 
programming can create, hovever, is a facility that will allow us 
to list, skctch, link and annotete the complexities ve seek to under^ 
stand, then present "views" of the complexities in many different forms. 
Studying these views, annotating and refining, ve can reach the final 
designs and decisions vith much rore in mind than we could otherwise 
hold together in the imagination.
Some of the facilities that such systems must have Include the 
following:
Annotations to anything, to any remove.
Alternatives of decision, design, writing, theory.
Unlinked or irreru]ar Pieces. hanging as the user wishes.
Hulticou-ling, or complex linkage, between alternatives, annota­
tions or whatever.
Histories! filin.- of the user’s actions, Including each addition 
end modification, and possibly the viewing actions that preceded them.
Frozen rpnertts and versions, which the user may hold as memrable 
for his thinking.
Evolutionary cour Linr, where the correspondences between evolving
We might also think of them as systems forversions are autcrsatically cair.talned, and their differences or relations 
easily annotated.
In addition, designs for screen "views", the motion, appearance 
and disappcnrancc of elements, require considerable thought and imagi­
nation.
The object is not to burden the user, or make him aware of complex­
ities in which he has no Interest. But almost everyone in intellectual 
and decision pursuits has at some time an implicit need for soae of 
these facilities. If people knew they were possible, they would daand 
them. It is time for their creation.
A full-fledged decision/creativity system, embracing both text and 
graphics, Is one of the ultieate design goals of Project XAHADU.

--- Page 126 ---

This user-level system is intended to aid in 
all forms of writing and scholarship, as well as 
anywhere else that we need to understand and mani­
pulate complex clusterings of text (i.e., thought).
It will also work with certain animated graphics.
The Parallel Textface, as described here, 
furnished the initial impetus for the development 
of the Xanadutm system (see p.$K$fe). Xanadu was 
developed, indeed, originally for the purpose of 
implementing some of these functions, but the two 
split apart. It turned out that the Parallel 
Textface required an extremely unusual data struc- 
structure and program techniques; these then became 
the Xanadu system. As developed in the final 
Xanadu design, they turn out to handle some very 
unusual kinds of screen animation and file retrieval. 
But this grew out of structuring a system to handle 
the functions described here.
Thus the Parallel Textface basically requires 
a Xanadu system.
It is hoped that this system can be sold com­
plete (including minicomputer or microprocessor-- 
no connection to a large computer is required) for 
a few thousand-dollars by 1976 or 1977. See p.
(Since "business people" are extremely skeptical 
as to whether anybody would want such a thing, I 
would be interested in hearing expressions of in­
terest, if any.)PARALLEL TEXTFACE (1971)

QHTZ- T
As shown here, the screen presents two panels 
text; more are allowed. Each contains a seg­
ment of a longer document. ("Page" would be an im­
proper term, since the boundary of the text viewed 
may be changed instantly.)
The other odds and ends on the screen are hid­
den keys to control elements which have been made 
to fade (in this illustration), just to lessen the 
distraction.
Panel boundaries and control graphics may b? 
made to appear by touching them w«1U fU.Two panels are about

ROVING FUNCTIONS
The text moves on the screen! (Essential.) 
The lower right hand corner of each text panel 
contains an inconspicuous control diagram. The 
slight horizontal extension is a movable control 
pip. The user, with his light pen, may move the 
pip up or down. "Up*causes the text to move 
smoothly upward (forward in the material), at a 
rate proportional to how far you push the pip; 
"down" causes it to move back. (Note that we do 
not refer here to jerky line-by-line jumps, but 
to smooth screen motion, which is essential in 
a high-performance system. If the text does not 
move, you can't tell where it came from.)DERIVATIVE MOTION: when links run sequential­
ly, connecting one-after-the-other on both sides, 
the contents of the second panel are pulled along 
directly: the smooth motion in one panel is match­
ed in. the other. This may be called derivative 
motion,  between independent text (being handled 
directly with the lightpen) and dependent text 
(being pulled along). The relationship may be re­
versed immediately, however, simply by moving the 
lightpen to the control pip of the other panel, 
whose contents then become the independent text.
Irregularities in the links will cause the 
independent text to move at varying speeds or jump, 
according to an average of the links1  connectivity.

If no links are shown, the dependent text just

Collateral links between material! in the 
two panels are displayed as movable lines bet­
ween the panels. (Text omitted in this diagram; 
panel boundary has been made to appear.)
Some links may not have both their endpoints 
displayed at once. In this case we show the in­
complete link as a broken arrow, pointing in the 
direction of the link's completion.
The broken arrow serves not merely as a vi­
sual pointer, but as a jump-marker leading to the 
linked material. By zapping the broken arrow with 
the lightpen, the user summons the linked material- 
as shown by the completion of the link t0 'he other 
panel. (Since there has been a jump in the second 
panel, we see that in this case the other link 
been broken.)
<g) H 72. T- uelso *
When such links lead to different places, both 
of these destinations may nevertheless be seen at 
once. This is. done by pointing at both broken links 
in succession; the system then allows both links to 
be completed, breaking the second panel ^
two destinations (as shown by dotted line across 
panel).

FAIL-SAFE AND HISTORICAL FEATURES.
In systems for naive users, it is essential 
to safeguard the user from his own mistakes. Thus 
in text systems, commands given in error must be 
reversible. For instance, Cannody's system (see 
p. DM'iJ) requires confirmation of deletions.
Another highly desirable feature would allow 
the user to view previous versions, to see them col­
laterally with the corresponding parts of current 
versions, and even go back to the way particular 
things were and resume work from the previous 
version.
In the Parallel Textface this is all com­
prised in the same extremely simple facility. (Ex­
tremely simple from the user's point of view, that 
is. Inside it is, of course, hairy.)
In an egregious touch of narcissistic humor, 
we use the very trademark on the screen as a control 
device (expanded from the "JC" shown in the first 
panel '
Actually the X in "Xanadutm," as it appears 
on the screen, is an hourglass, with a softly fall* 
ing trickle of animated dots in the lower half, and 
Sands of Time seen as heaps above and below. These 
have a control, as well as a representative, func­
tion.
TO UNDO SOMETHING, YOU MERELY STEP "BACKWARD 
IN TIME" by dagging the upper part of the hourglass 
with the lightpen. One poke, one editing operation 
undone. Two pokes, two operations.
You may then continue to view and nake changes 
'as if the last two operations had never taken place. 
This effectively creates an alternative time-line.* 
ilowever, if you decide that a previously undone edit 
operation~fhould be kept after all, you may step 
forward-- stepping onto the previous time-line-- 
by-using the lower half of the hourglass.

We see this clarified in a master time diagram 
o* Revision Tree which may be summoned to the screen, 
never mind how. In this example we see that three 
versions are still "current," various other starts 
and variations having been abandoned. (The shaggy

The user-- let’s say he is a thoughtful writer- 
may define various Versions or Drafts, here marked 
on the Revision Tree.Materials may be copied between versions. (Note 
that in the copying operation of the Parallel Text­

as- a block . 1
GETTING AROUND
The user may have a number of standby layouts, 
with different numbers of panels, and jump among 
them by stabs of the lightpen.
Importantly, the panels of each can be full, 
each having whatever tne contents were”JJhen you last

and as a Thinkertoy, organizing complex alternatives. 
(The labels say: "Conflicting versions," ’’New account 
of conflicts,” "Exposition of how different accounts 
deal with objections," "Improved, synthesizing account.'
In other words. In this approach ve annotate and 
label discrepancies, and verbally comment on differen­
ced in separate files or documents.
In ways this may seem somewhat obtuse. Yet above 
all it is orderly, and the complex of collateral files 
has a clarity that could be all-too-easily lost in sy­
stems which were programmed more specifically to each 
problem.

The fundamental strength of collateration, 
seen here, is of course that any new structure 
collateral to another may be used as a table of 
contents or an outline, taking the user instantly 
to parts which are of interest in some new context.
* Oddly, this has the saae logical structure as 
time-travel in science-fiction.
There are basically three alternate premises of 
of time-travel: 1) that the past cannot be changed, 
all events having preceded the backstep; 2) that the 
past can be changed; and 3) that while time-travelers 
may be deluded into thinking ( 2), that ( 1) is really 
the case—  leading to various appointaeat-in-S&aarra 
plots.
Only possibility (2) is of interest here, but 
there are various alternative logics of mutability and 
time-line stepping. One of the best I have seen is in 
The Man Who Folded Himself by David Gerrold (Popular 
riFrary, 1973): logic expounded pp. 64-8. I aa be­
mused by the parallel between GerTold's time-controls 
and these, worked out independently.

This design, TfO (Thlnkercoy ln 
3 dimensions), Is one 1 have been work­
ing at while on che faculty of che Univ­
ersity of Illinois. Ic Is designed spe­
cifically for Implementation using De­
mand's GRASS language (eee p O “V3\)> 
and che Vector General 3D display (see 
P-*V)- Whether It will ever be actually 
programed depends, of course, on nuaer- 
ous factors.
It Is aeant to be a very hiah- 
power Chlnkertoy, suitable for experlaen- 
CaClon with creative processes, especially 
writing and three-dlnenalonal deaign.
(There le no rooa Co discuss Che latter 
here.) It Is suited especially Co the visual­
ization of tenCatlve structures ln amorphous 
clusters. In some of Its features It goes 
considerably beyond che nore "coonerclal" 
chlnkertoy systen, the Parallel Texcface 
(elsewhere ln this spread).
Nevertheless, the same design criteria 
spply: a well-designed coaputer environment 
for any purpose should be learnable in ten 
minutes; otherwise the designer hae not been 
doing hla Job. (I mean it would be learnable 
ln ten minutes If you and 1 had lc in front 
of ue, working. This description will have 
to be weird and abatruse, I’m sorry to aay.)
This systea Is designed around a three- 
dlnenslonal display screen (che Vector Gener­
al display, ae aanlpulable by th^RASS lan­
guage) .
Now, moat people do not think of text 
as Chree-dlaenslonal. Laymen think of It as 
two-dlmenelonal, since It’s usually printed 
on rectangular pages. Conputer people or­
dinarily think of lc as one-dlmenslonal, as 
a long string of characters and apacea—  
easendally what you'd get If you printed 
thlnge ln one line on a long, long ribbon. 
Well, frankly, I don't think of text as 
thr«e-dlmenelonal eleher; but like anything 
else, lc has numerous qualities or dimen- 
alons, sny three of which It's nice to be 
able to view at once (aee "Dlaenalonal Flip,") 
p.k^V)* And that's essentially the idea: 
the Chree dimensions we'll look at at any 
one tiae will be a particular view of a larger
Now, the basic torm of storage will be 
one of those Nelaon-structurea that drives 
computer people batty. Specifically, the 
basic data structure will be clusters of
Puns sometimes reflect a higher reality.
Now lc turns out that this structure In fact 
reflects a great Folk Truth: written discourse 
does in fact consist of "points" which you 
Intend to get across.  That we here Intend to 
have them rotate as dots upon a screen reflects 
this structure.
Writing le, in fact, a projection from 
the Intended "points" Co a finished exposition 
which embraces then. Now, Chla Is very like 
the view of language held in modern linguistics, 
nanely, that a finished sentence 1s a "surface 
structure" constructed out of basic sentence 
kernels chewed up by certain transformations.  
Well, I aa juat pointing out here that writing 
Is a surface structure of "points" which have 
been embedded and spliced In a structure of 
transitions, accordance-notes and so forth (aee
p- * * 1 3 )*
The general idea of the Th3 eyetem, then, 
la that the user may view the "poincs" he 
wishes to make, variously upon the 3D viewing 
surface. Successive drafts, then, will sll be 
projections. geometrically, from this interior 
structure of points.
Finally, the unifying Idea that gives the 
systea simplicity Is this: all views will be on 
faces of a cube.
(FURTHER TECHNICALITIES OF THESE 'POINTS': 
Each point aay have a value (numerical pa­
rameter) in any of a number of dimensions 
(which nuaber may itself change). Such 
values aay be null, as distinct from zero, 
showing chac the point has no poelCion on 
chac particular ecale.
Associated with each point may be one 
or more plecee and scrape or written mater­
ial. Such scraps may be Just phrases or 
single words. (Indeed, such scraps may be 
associated not JusC with a point, but with 
several specific vslues of a point.) Each 
scrap may also contain keywords.
Discrete reladons between points may 
alao be defined. There may be a variety 
of types of relation, which either exlat 
between two points of don't.)The crucial point here is cnac it's unified 
Co che ueer: every version appears on a aide of 
a boa; and a typeset version le slaply a magni­
fied two-dimensional view Id which the two dlaen- 
elone are "poaltlon in overall text" (vertical) 
and "poaltlon on line" (horizontal).
Each aide of a box aay have a different 
view projected to It. This meane that as many 
as three viewa of a specific cluster may be 
seen at once. However, for conslecency these 
■uat hsve appropriately comon dimensions.
By rotation and zooming the uaer aay focus 
on the original pieces, and work with thea, writ­
ing and revising.
Moreover, by using a combination of soon 
and hardware clipping (aa available on chls 
equipment), the uaer may restrict his work to 
a specific range of material on particular di­
mensions .
GALAXY AND BOX
There are baalcally two views of whac 
you are working with: the Galaxy and the Box.
They appear ln various manifestations, allow­
ing you to study discrete relations and struc­
tures ln the material; various "dimensions" of 
the material; alternate versions and drafts to 
be made from che maCerlal; and the complex col- 
lateratlon (see under "Thlnkertoys") of differ­
ent structures.
In what follows we will discuss the screen 
functions but not the control structures, which 
have not firmed up particularly.
1. GALAXY VIEWS.
The poin.ts are seen aa a cloud of dots on 
the screen. If no view coordlnstes are supplied, 
the dote will be randomly positioned.
A. "Star Trek" effect.
Under a user's zooa control, the docs 
fly apart as if he ie hurtling through 
spsce.
B. MAGNIFICATION. The user may "magnify"
the dots, making each show les keywords, 
further text, and on up to the full 
Piece.
C. ROTATION. The 3D structure of the dote
ln epace may be eeen by the user at 
any time through short rotatlone.
D. Any relations that exist among the
Points, Insofar as they have been logg-
Z. The user may sort the points by moving 
them with a lightpen.
F. The user may write within the individ­
ual pieces and splice them together, 
combining lightpen and keyboard oper-
2. BOX VIEWS
In the Galaxy Vlewe, the Individual Points 
simply ewann about wlch no definable position. 
'Box Views" allow you to order che points on any 
dlmenelone that have meaning to you, ln an ar­
bitrary coordlnate-space.
The box is more than a mere measureaent- 
frame. On request the user may see Che points 
projected on a specific face of the box (ortho- 
graphlcally); and on request he may alao eee pro­
jection lines between a box-face and Its cor­
responding point in the point cluster.
"Magnifying^' as before, will create a view 
of the text: but in Che box mode of viewing, the 
text appears on the side of the box.  That Is, 
the Inner view will project to the ouCslde, 
yielding a draft. Naturally, thle Is the current 
assembly of your pieces; lf certain coordinates 
are selected 1C la even s "typeset" version.
(Note: Vector General hardware does not al­
low character rotation; only keyword and headline 
rotation Is possible, through software characcer 
generation. Thus text pieces on the side of a 
box ehow certain freaky movements lf the elde 1s 
not viewed square-on.)
& At the 1971 Spring Joint Conputer Conference, I think It waa,
I wae heckled by a linguist who accused ae of being "uniiiaglnadve," 
Insisting further that writing Is merely an extension of speech 
and thue "merely" the application of further transformations; and 
he claimed further that what the uaer therefore needs la sn input 
language to specify theae transformations. This view, while Inter­
esting, Is wrong.
A buc/lndeed concrol language eight be Intereating, however.

COLLATERAL GALAXIES AND BOXES.
Viewing of collateral etructurea works 
through the eaae mechanism. Galaxies and 
boxes aay be collateraced:
COMPLICATED NOTE: The extension of chese 
aeehanlsms to pictorial graphics 1t» two 
and three dlmenslona Is scralghcforward,  
and to conceptual substructures (such aa 
may exlat) behind theee graphice. The 
ssae goes for collateratlon and annocadon -  
of multidimensional cluster materials, e.g. 
in sociology: the eyetem would allow, for 
Instance, che viewing, annotation and col­
lateratlon of aoclometrlc clusterings.)
BOX FISSION. (The Beauty Part.)
For paired views of projections from 
the saae cluster which do not share a com­
mon coordinate, a marvelous Crick la poa­
aible: BOX FISSION. Starting with one box 
containing a galaxy, we pull it apart,  
making two boxes and two galaxies whose 
Polnta are linked.
Now both boxes csn be rotated indepen­
dently, and any view coneldered; equlvalence- 
llnkages may now be viewed between any Cwo 
views. (The eye must, however, cum two 
corners.)
(It Is Interesting to note inat the llnka In 
Box Fission are handled automatically, co an 
extent, by the hardware.)
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE. HUH?
Thle has euaaarlzed the development of 
some Ideas for the viewing and manipulation 
of complex stuff. I offer thle design, Inso­
far as I have been able to present It 
ss sn example of fantic deaign (eee p. 5 0)- 
There le.no logical necessity to It; It cor­
responds to the tradleional sCructure of no 
technical systea; It arises froa no Intrinsic 
or traditional data etrucCures used for coa­
puter repreeencatlon of these things.
But none of theee considerations la co 
the point. This design has a certain stark 
logical alapllclty; it extends Itself plaua- 
Ibly from Its basic outlook (or starting 
Idess, If you can ieolate them) into a tool
for truly intricate cross-consideration, 
without adding unneceaeary and hard-to- 
reiwaber "technicalltlea." At leaat that a 
how I think of 1C.
Obviously the aeathedcs of ic are la- 
portant to the designer. But a more final 
criterion of Its goodneas—  les uaefulnesa—  
may depend on the same parsimony and organi­
zational clarity.

In* Xanadu did Kubl& Khan 
A (lately pleasure-doinc decree :
Where Alpli, tlic sucrcd river, no 
Through caverns measureless toman 
Down to a sunless son.
So twice five miles of fertile ground 
With walls and lowers were girdled round :
And there were gardens bright with slnuoua rill* 
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing dee:
And berc were forests unrient as tbe hills,
Enfolding sunny spow of greenery.
But ob !  that devp romantic cliaam which slanted 
Down the green hill athwart a cedars cover I  
A savage place I  as holy and enchanted 
As e'er oeaeath a waning moon was luiuntcd 
By woman walling for her demou-lover !
And from this chum, with reaaclcss turmoil eee thing, 
Aa If tbls earth lo fast thick p uuis were breaLhiog,
A mighty fountalu momently was forced :
Amid whose swift lialf-iniemiiited bunt 
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hall,
Or chofly grain beneath lhe thresher's flail :
And 'mid these dunclog rocks al oncc and evif
Il flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion 
Through wool aad dale the sacred river mo,
Then reached the caverns measureless u >  mao.
And sank In tumult to a lifeless ocean ;
Aad 'mid this tumult Kubla beard from far 
Ancestral voices prophesying war !
The shadow of lhe dome of pleasure 
Floated mid way on Ibe waves ;
Where was beard the mingled measure 
From the fountain nod the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A eunnv pleasurc-doine wilh caves of icc 1  
A damsel wilh a dulcimer 
In a vision oucc I saw ;
It was an Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of Mount Abora.
Could I revive wiiblo me 
Her symphony and song,
To suck a deep delight twould win me 
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome In nir.
That sunny dome !  those eaves of Ice !
And all who heard should see them there.
And all should cry, Beware ' Beware !
His flashing eyes, his flooiiug hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with lioly dread.
For be on Louey-dew hath fed.
And drunk Lhe milk of Paradise.
"Is that the riv e r that runs down to the sea?"

Patent worX on Xanadu is in progress.Xanadu, friend, is dream.
The name comes from the poem (nearby);  
Coleridge's little story of the artistic trance 
(and the Person from PoTlock) make it an appro­
priate name' for the Pleasure Dome of the crea­
tive writer. The Citizen Kane connotations, 
and any other connotations you may find in the 
poem, are side benefits.
1 have been working on Xanadu, under this 
and other names, for fourteen years now.
Originally it was going to be a super sys­
tem for handling text by computer (see p. \% 
and )♦ But it grew: as I realized, level
by level, how deep the problem was.
And the concept of what it was' to be kept 
changing, as 1 saw more and more clearly that 
it had to be on a minicomputer for the home.
(You can have one in your office too, if you 
want, but that's not what it’s about.)
Now the idea is this:
To give you a screen in your home from 
which you can see into the world's hypertext 
libraries.
(The fact that the world doesn’t have 
any hypertext libraries-- yet-- is a minor 
point.)
To give you a screen system that will 
offer high-performance computer graphics and 
•text services at a price anyone can afford.
To allow you to send and receive written mes­
sages at the Engelbart level (see p.J)r'It/6)» To 
allow you to explore diagrams (see p. DM19 and 
P. 1)11.51) .  To eliminate the absurd distinction 
between "teacher" and "pupil."
To make you a part of a new electronic 
literature and art, where you can get all your 
questions answered and nobody will put you 
down.
Originally Xanadu was programmed around 
the Parallel Textface (see p. DH^)* But as 
the requirements of the Parallel Textface were 
better and better understood, Xanadu became 
a more general underlying system for all forms 
of interactive graphic environments. Its data 
structure has Virtual Blocklessness and is 
thus well related to the smooth motions needed 
by screen users. Thus in its final form, now 
being debugged, it will support not only the 
Parallel Textface (see p. 5^) )» the Walking Net 
(see p. W5| ), Stretchtext (see p. DMl9), Zoom 
Maps (see p. Dtfl3) and so on, but indeed any 
data structure that needs to combine complex 
linkages with fast access and rapid chances. 
Because the data structure is recursively 
extensible, it will permit hypertext (see\p.DHTi) 
of any depth and complexity, and the collateral 
linkage (see p. ^52) of any objects of contemp­
lation.
Xanadu is under private development and 
should be available, if the economy holds, in 
1976. Regrettably, first prices will not be at 
the $3000 level necessary for the true Home 
System. Exact equipment for the production ver­
sion has not been selected. A number of micro­
processors (see p. 4H )  are in serious conten­
tion, notably the Lockheed SUE, but there’s 
something to be said for a regular mini. The 
PDP-11 is of interest (see p.^12 ); (so espe­
cially is its Cai Data lookalike-- unless DEC 
would like to build us a PDP-11X with seven modes 
of indirect display addressing. Are you reading 
this, Ken Olsen?) And here’s a laugh: a com­
pany called IBM may in fact make a suitable com­
puter, except that they call it the "3740 Work 
Station." So for those customers who want IBM 
equipment, maintenance and prices, with Xanadu 
software, it’s a definite possibility.
So, fans, that about wraps it up. I’ll be 
interested in hearing from people who want this 
system; many hardheaded business people have 
told me nobody will. Prove ’em wrong, America!
Of course, if hyper-media aren’t the great­
est thing since the printing press, this whole 
project falls flat on its face. But it is hard 
for me to conceive that they will not be.

1) Knowledge, understanding uul 
freedom <an all be advanced by Ihe 
promotion and deployment ol com­
puter display conioles (wilh the 
right programs behind (hem).
2) Computer presentational media, 
coming soon, will nol be technically 
determined but ralhcr will be new 
realms for human artUtry. This point 
of view radially aflocO * how w v 
design man machinc systems of any 
kind, especially lh®e for mlomw 
lion retrieval. leaching, and general 
writing and reading. Some practi­
tioners see such systems as narrowly 
technical, with the computer howling 
up little piece* o( writing on some 
"scientific” basis and showing them 
to you one grunt at a time. A  Metre- 
o l banquet. I disagree. The system* 
should be opulent.
3) The problem in presentational 
systems of ony kind i» lo make 
things look good, feel right.and come 
across clearly. The things that mai­
ler arc I ho feci of the system, the 
user’ s state of mind, his possible con 
fusion, boredom or enthusiasm, the 
problems of communicating concf/it-'.  
and the very nature of concepts nnd 
their interconnection There will 
never I t  a "sciencc" of presentation, 
eiccpl as il relates lo these things 
4i Nol lhe nature of machines, 
but the nature of ideas,  is what 
matters. Il is incredibly hard to de­
velop. organize nnd transmit idea<, 
and il always wiU U-. Bui at least
trapped by the nature of tKiprr We 
o n  design nugic |xi|*rIl is lime to start using computers 
to hold information for the mind 
much as books have held this infor­
mation in Ihc past. Now information 
for the mind is very different from 
"information for the computer" as 
we have thought of il, hacked up 
and compressed into blocks. Instead 
we can slrclch the computer.
I sm proposing a cur ions kind of 
subversion. "Let us design.” ] say; 
and when people sec the eyviems, 
everybody will wanl one. All I wanl 
lo do is put Rcnai&ancr humanism 
in a multidimensional responsive con­
sole. And I am trying lo work oul

Hypcrtrits.
Hypcrlcilx: new forms of writing, 
appearing on computer saeens, that 
will branch or (Erform at Ihc reader's 
OHnmand. A hypertext is a non­
sequential piece of writing; only the

Somewhere between a book, a TV 
show and n penny nraide. ihe hyper- 
text can be a vnsl lopeslry of infor­

Il is essen tial lo slate these firmly and 
pub licly , because you a re  going lo see a lot 
of system s in the n ear fu ture that p u rp o rt to 
be Ihe lasl-w ord cat's-p ajam s system s lo brin g  
you "all the information you need, anytime, 
an y w h e re ." U nless you have thought about il 
you may be snow ed by system s which a re  in­
heren tly  and deeply lim iting. Here are some 
of Ihe things w hich I think we w ill all wanl.
(The salesman for the olh er system  will say 
(hey a re  im possible, or "We don't know how 
to do that y e t,"  the standard puldow n. But 
th ese things a re  p ossible. If we design them 
in from Ihe bottom up; and th ere a re  many 
different valid a pproaches w hich could b rin g  
th ese things into b e in g ,)
These a re  ru le s , d e riv e d  from common 
sense and uncommon c o n cern , about what people 
can and should have in g eneral screen  system s, 
system s lo read from .
1. EASY AND ARBITRARY FRONT eVjDS.
T he "front en d " of a sy stem -- that is, 
the program  that creates Ihe presentations for 
the u se r and interacts with him— must be clear 
an d  simple for people to uee and u n d e rstan d .
THE TEN-MINUTE RULE. Any system 
w hich cannot be well laugh! lo a layman in 
ten m inutes, by a lulor in the p resence of a 
responding se lu p , is loo complicated. T his may 
sound far loo strin g en t; I th in k  nol. Rich and 
pow erful system s may be giv en  front ends which 
a re  nonetheless ridiculously clear; this Is a 
design problem of the foremost im portance.
TEXT MUST MOVE, that is, slide on Ihe 
sc re en  when the u se r step s forw ard or backw ard 
w ithin (he text he is ree d in g . T he alternative, 
to clear the screen  and lay out a new p resen ta­
tion. is baffling to the eye and thoroughly dis­
o rien tin g . even w ith p ractice.
Many com puter people do not y et u nder­
stand Ihe necessity of Ihis. The problem is that 
if the screen is c lea re d , and something new 
then appears on it. (here ia no visual way lo 
tell w here Ihe new thing came from: sequence 
and stru c tu re  become balTling. Having it slide 
on (he screen allow s you lo u n d erstand w here 
you 'v e been and w here y o u 're  going; a feeling 
you also gel from tu rn in g  p ages of a book.
(Some close sub stitu tes may be possible on 
some types of sc re e n .)
On front e n d s supplied for normal u se rs, 
th ere must be no explicit com puter languages 
req u irin g  input control s trin g s, no visible eso­
teric symbols. G raphical control stru ctu res 
having clarity and safety, o r v ery clear task- 
orienled key b o ard s, are among the prim e alter­
natives .
All operations must be fail-safe.
A rbitrary front ends must be attachable: 
since we a rc  talk in g  about read in g  from text, 
o r texl-an d -p iclu re com plexes, stored on a 
large data system , Ihe presentational front end 
must be separable from the data serv ices p ro ­
vided further dow n in the system , so Ihe user 
may attach his own front-end system , having 
his own style of operslion and his own private 
conveniences for ro v in g , editing and olher forms 
of w ork o r play al the s c re e n .
2. SMOOTH AND RAPID DATA ACCESS.
The system must be built lo make possible 
fast and a rb itra ry  access (o a potentially huge 
data b a se, allowing extremely large files (at 
least into Ihe b illions of ch arac ters). However, 
Ihe system  should be contrived to allow you to 
read forw ard, back o r acro ss links w ithout su b ­
stantial hesitation. Such access must be impli­
cit, nol req u irin g  knowledge of w here th ings a re  
physically stored o r what the internal file names 
m ay.happen to b e . Pile divisions must be in ­
visible lo Ihe u6er in all his roving operations 
(FREEDOM OF ROVING): boundaries must be 
inviaible in the final p resentations, and the u ser 
must not need lo know about them.
3. RICH DATA FACILITIES.
A rbitrary linkages must be possible b e­
tw een portions of text, o r text and pictures: 
annotation of an y thing must be provided for; 
collateraiion (see p . *Tjo) should be a standard 
facility, between any pair of w ell-defined ob­
jects; PLACEMARK facilities must be allowed 
to drop anchor a t, o r in. a nything. These 
features imply p riv ate  annotations lo publicly- 
accessible materials as a stan d ard  automatic 
a erv ice mode.I want a world where wo can read the world's literature from screen? rnllwr 
than personally searching out the physical books. A world without routine i.-ipcr- 
work. because ;ill copying operations '.nix ptaco automatically and lyrinaliicd trail* 
■actions occur through formalized ceremonies at consoles. A world whcic can 
learn, study, croato. a^id share our creations without having nrivatelv toschlopp aud 
physically safeguard thi-m. There is a familiar. all-embracing motto, the jingle we 
all know from the day school lets oul. which I lai.o quite seriously: " S o more pencils; 
do more books: no more teachers' diity looks ” The Fntilic Age.

Now you see why I brought you here.
This Gem-maniacal book has, obviously, been 
created as a crossroad of several cross pur­
poses: to furnish a needed, grabby layman's 
Introduction to two vast but rather inaccessible 
realms; to present a coherent, if contentious, 
point of view, and unroll a particular sort of 
apocalyptic vision after preparing the vocabulary 
for it; to make bright friends and informed sup­
porters for my outlook and projects; to get home 
lo some of my friends the fact lhal what 1 am 
doing is at bottom not technical; and finally, if 
nothing else, to set forth some principles about 
the'way things should be. which others will 
have-to answer if they propose to do less.
Thus, overall, this book is a message in a Klein 
bottle, waiting to see who’s thirsty.
I suppose it all started in college. Swarth- 
roore left me with an exaggerated notion of (he 
extent to which ideas are valued in the academic 
world; it took two graduate schools to clear this 
up. After thal. as far as 1  was concerned.
Ph.D. stood for Poophead. But I still cared 
about ideas, and the deep necessity of finding 
their true structure and organization. From 
writing 1 knew the grueling difficulty of trying 
to make ideas get in order. 1 believed in the 
pure, white light of inspiration and the power of 
the naive but clever mind to figure out anything, 
if not obstructed bul dumb dogmas and obtuse 
mental schemata foslered by the educational system.
When 1 Anally got the idea of what compu­
ters were aboul, sometime in 1960, 1 look endless 
walks at night trying to hash these things out and 
see where they led. The text systems came clear 
to me, at least in ihelr beginnings; in a few weeks; 
the realisation that 3D halftone was possible came 
to me as a 6hock the following spring. I believe 
as I was walking across Radcliffe Common. Since 
then trying to build these systems for creation and 
the true ordering of intricale thought has been my 
driving dream.
My own life among these dream machines 
haa been a nightmare, thoroughly unpleasant, 
and if people are right in telling me thal nobody 
wants systems like the ones I am designing.
I’ll get the heck out of this and be a disk jockey 
or a toy salesman or something.1 first got into this as a writer; all 1 
wanted was a decent writing system that would 
run on a compuier. Little did I realize the Im­
mensity of what that entailed, or that for some 
reason my work and approach would engender 
indignation and anger wherever 1 wenl. There 
is a Action that everybody In theee fields is 
doing something fundamentally scientific and 
technical, and this Action is usually upheld in 
carefully enacted mutual playlets. Trying to 
cut through that and say, "Let's build a home for 
mankind that will al last be shaped lo At man's 
mind,” does nol seem to-generate immediate 
warmth and welcome.
But I'm glad for the friends I've made in 
this Aeld, and of course there have been a lol 
of laughs. (I'd really have haled to miss being 
in this field, just for the thrilling madness of 
it all.) All in all my adventures have been a 
sort of participatory journalism, which I'd like 
to wrile up properly some time. Some highlights:
The days of madness in '66, trying to 
start an honesl corporation to do all this stuff, 
and suffering endless lunches with Wall Street 
hangers-on who were looking for a vehicle to 
take public. They wanted another chicken- 
franchise type company, though, and certainly 
not ideas.
Being briefed by four different corporations, 
most of lhem major, on Ihe fantastic powers iheir 
inleractive'movie system was going to have. One 
of these briefings was in the board room of a 
famous skyscraper. And now, only one of those 
systems is left-- Kodak's.
Then there was the courtly gentleman who 
was going to be my Noah Dietrich, my Colonel 
Parker. He assured me that through his business 
connections all was going lo go marvelously.  
and then later intimated thet as e special favor 
he was going lo put me In touch with other 
universes and the flying saucer people. I just 
didn't have time for other universes.Then there was the suppression of my first 
book (this i6 my second). You might say it wa6 
a misunderstanding, at least on my part. My 
boss's understanding was evidently (hat the ad­
vancement of my ideas would be detrimental to 
his. If it had been a question of free speech in 
Yugoslavia it might have been different. Well, 
it takes a long lime to get a book together, but 
here we go again.
Then there was the time I was called in 
as a consultant on a vast federal system, never 
mind what. Numerous computer programs were 
lo be coordinated by a hypertext system they 
had created and Ihey wanted to know if they'd 
designed it right. It took months lo find out 
from Ihe programmers exactly what the system 
waa,  so I ended up writing the manual; after 
which I explained what was wrong with the pro­
ject and the whole hypertext system was scrapped. 
And my job with it. I never quite got lhe swing 
of consulting.
Flying coasl-to-coast with the preaident 
of a large corporation, he and I planned the 
whole Xanadu budget for the following year at 
something like half a million dollars. Two years 
later, reduced In circumstances and driving a 
yellow cab in New York, the miserable vehicle 
breaks down in front of (hose same corporate 
headquarters. And Ihe reason I had thal bad 
taxi was that I was out of favor with the taxi 
dispatcher, on account of having been absent 
the previous week-- I had had to fly to California 
to give a banquet address at the Rand Corporation.
Then there were my adventures with the
CIA.Thai did It. They couldn't read either. 
Who turns oul to be in charge of computer stuff 
in the heart of the CIA. the Inner sanctum, the 
nesl of vipers, but the same old poopy Ph.Ds.
I decided to reauscitate my virtue.
As far as I know, there is still not a 
Decent Writing Syatem anywhere in the world, 
although several things now come close. It 
seems a shame that grown men and women have 
to rustle around in piles of paper, like squirrels 
looking for acorns,  in search of the phrases 
and ideas Ihey themselves have generated.
The decent w riting 9yslem, as I see it. will 
^dually be much more: it will help ua create 
belter things in a fraction of the time, but also 
keep track of everything in better and more 
subtle waya than we ever could before.
But nobody sees this—  I suppose it's only 
writers and editors that know they're trying to 
"keep track of Ideas"-- and I have been unable 
to gel thia across to anybody. (The profeaeional 
writers, of course, won't talk to me either.)
So here I am after fourteen years with 
exactly two systems to show for it: the main one. 
Xanadu, the lext-and-animated-piclure network 
system, and Fantasm (1 shouldn't have apent 
the time bul it was a labor of love), the simu- 
laled-photography system. Actually, 1 don'l 
have either of them to show, it's all just flow­
charts, but it turns out lhat if I work on either 
of (hem with university equipment, my work of 
fourteen years gets conAscated. So much for 
thal; the outside expedients for debugging con­
tinue .
I was sitting in my office at Vassar, 
sagely advising a student, when the phone rang 
and the caller identified himself as John W.
Kuipers. head of compuier research at the CIA.
He told me I had been noticed as a new bright 
young man in the Aeld, and would I  like to 
work for them?
Now, there is something about being a 
cynic and a romantic. (They go together: the 
cynic deAates ideas, the romantic falls in love 
with them.) It is not impossible for the cynical 
romantic to surmise that because everything he 
has seen personally turned oul to be so lousy, 
thal the true hope may lie at the heart of the 
vortex, just where everybody thinks is impossible. 
Also Ihe Kennedy aftermath, when sophisticated 
people had learned to laugh at simple idealism 
as a facade for the reel wheel-and-deallng, 
slap-and-tickle, may have had something to do 
wilh il; anyway, I waa enchanted. Thus began 
the Kuipers Caper.
YES. THERE IS A McLEAN. VIRGINIA
I was given a handler named Bob, a jolly 
fellow, who kept assuring me that much money 
was just around (he corner. I was regaled wilh 
success s(ories of other people in the computer 
Aeld who really, undercover Worked for Them. 
(They weren't doing anything very exciting.)
I got to show my slides in the CIA office building 
in Arlington, and to eee there very fancy display 
equipment behind shielded (!) double-doors in 
a shielded (!!) computer room-- shielded lo keep 
any planted bugs from transmitting oul the con­
tents of the computers' working registers. I even 
got to visit the main CIA "campus" in McLean, 
Virginia, where the sign says Agricultural 
Research Station. It is an incredible feeling to 
walk across lhat big eagle in lhe lerrazzo, 
and to be given the visitor's badge thal says 
"United Slates Government" all in wiggly lines.
They told me that they would be glad to 
set me up in business as s hypertext company, 
bul I would have to have a corporation, because 
that was Ihe way they always did things. And so. 
it came lo pass that The Nelson Organization, Inc. 
was founded al the express request of the United 
Stales Central Intelligence Agency. I wouldn't have 
had it any other way. If life can't be pleasant it 
can et least be surrealistic.
.  .. BUT NO SANTA CLAUS
I was encouraged to write proposals for them, 
and write proposals I did. (1 happened to finish 
typing the first one dufing a lightning slorm, 
and lightning crashed jusl as I was signing the 
page; 1 felt like Faust.) I explained how hyper­
text might have prevented the Bay of Pigs. After 
due consideration, I did not say what hypertexts 
might have done for Ihe Warren Report. Numerous 
Jolly phone calls assured me lhat my firsl $25,000 
was just around the corper.
The break came when Bob called me and 
asked me to rewrite a proposal one more lime.
He had circulated it, he aaid, among various 
people "at the shop," who he reminded me were 
holders of advanced degrees, and it had been 
remarked that they found my proposal meaning­
less: "Every place you say 'hypertext' you 
could jusl aa well put 'gobbledygook' instead; 
you'll have lo clear lhat up a little."And, to lighlen Ihe burden. I've finally 
given up on trying lo reach professionals, who 
evidently need a Ihick gravy of lechnicalism to 
make the obvious palatable; with this bookity 1 am taking my case to The People. It is there, 
anyway, out in Consumerdom. lhal the real ac­
tion is going to occur. So the important thing 
is for everybody to know whal's really possible, 
and what (hey could have. Thai Is why I have 
shol off my big canons (and ihi6 epistol).
To me. you see. this is really a holy 
crusade, whereas I know guys to whom il's 
jusl a living. It's no less than a question 
of freedom in our lime. The cases of Solzhenitsyn 
and Ellsberg remind us that freedom is slill 
not what it should be, anywhere. Computer 
display and storage can bring us a whole new 
literature, the uniting and the apotheosis of the 
old end the new; but (here are many who would 
not necessarily wanl to see this come about.
Deep and widespread compuier systems would be 
tempting to two dangerous parties, "organized ,  
crime" and the Executive branch of Ihe Federal 
government (assuming there ia still a difference 
between the two). If we are lo have the freedoms 
of information we deserve as a free people, the 
safeguards have to be built in al the bottom.  now. 
And the opulence which is possible must be made 
clear to everyone before we settle on an inferior 
system-* as we did with television.
Some people have called my Ideas and 
systems "Orwellian." This is annoying In two 
ways. In the first place It suggests the night­
mare of Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four,  
which obviously I want no part of. (Bul hey,  
do you remember what that world of 1984 was 
actually like? The cryptic wars against unseen 
enemies that kept shifting? The government 
spying? The use of language lo twist end 
manipulate? To paraphrase Huey Long: "Of 
course we'll have 1984 in America. Only we'll 
cell it 1972.")
The second reason the term "Orwellian'1  
is offensive is that it somehow reduces (he life 
of Orwell, the man. to the world of "1984."
This is a shallow and shabby thing to do to a 
man who apent his life unmasking oppressiveness 
in human institutions everywhere.
In the larger sense, then—  In homage to 
thal simple, honest, angry man, who cared about 
nothing more lhan human freedom-- I would be 
proud indeed if my systems could be called 
Orwellian.
That reminds me. Nowhere in the book 
hsve 1 defined the phrase "computer lib." By 
Compuier Lib I mean simply: making people 
freer through computers. Thal'a all.
Fantically—  or fanatically—
Yours for a better world,
Before we have to settle for Any--
