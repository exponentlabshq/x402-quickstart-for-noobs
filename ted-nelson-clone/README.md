## Ted Nelson's Vision

Ted Nelson coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia" and envisioned:

- **Non-sequential writing** - Documents that branch and allow choice to the reader
- **Transclusion** - The same content appearing in multiple places
- **Versioning** - Tracking changes and maintaining document history
- **Micropayments** - Paying for content as you access it (Xanadu project)
- **Two-way links** - Links that work in both directions, showing what links to what

## For Hackathon Participants

These texts are provided to help you understand:
- The original vision of hypertext and the web
- How payment systems were envisioned from the start
- The difference between what was imagined and what we built
- Inspiration for building better, more interconnected systems

## Related Concepts

- **HTTP 402 Payment Required** - A status code reserved for digital payment systems
- **X402 Protocol** - Modern implementation of payment-required content delivery
- **Micropayments** - Small payments for individual pieces of content

## Usage

To extract text from additional PDFs or images, use the `extract_text.py` script in the parent directory:

```bash
python3 extract_text.py
```
